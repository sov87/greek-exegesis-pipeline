**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ϲυνκαλεϲαμενοϲ δε τουϲ δωδεκα αποϲτολουϲ δε αυτοιϲ δυ και εξουϲι επι παντα τα δαιμονια και νο θεραπευειν

**English Translation**
And having called together the twelve apostles, [he gave] to them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the divine economy of delegation. The Lord does not merely send them; He equips them. The text reads *de autois du*—abbreviating *dunamin* (power)—and *exousi* (authority). Power is the inherent strength; authority is the right to exercise it. Note the scope: *epi panta ta daimonia* (over *all* the demons). No spirit is exempt from the apostolic command. The manuscript abbreviates *nosous* (diseases) as *no*, indicating that to the spiritual eye, the healing of the flesh is a swift consequence of spiritual authority.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και απεϲτιλεν αυ κηρυϲϲειν την βαϲιλειαν του και τουϲ αϲθενιϲ

**English Translation**
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and [to heal] the sick.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the dual nature of the apostolic office: Word and Deed. He sent (*apestilen*) them first to herald (*keryssen*) the Kingdom. The text abbreviates the divine name (*tou* for *tou theou*), reminding us that the Kingdom belongs solely to the Father. Secondly, they are to attend to *tous asthenis* (the weak/sick). The Codex leaves the verb for healing implied here, suggesting that the very presence of the Kingdom's heralds brings wholeness to the infirm.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν προϲ αυ μηδεν αιρε ειϲ την οδον μητε ραβδον μητε πηραν μητε αρτον μηδε αργυριον μητε δυο χιτωναϲ εχετε

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Take nothing for the road, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor have two tunics.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A command of absolute stripping. The Lord forbids the *rabdon* (staff) and the *peran* (beggar's bag), removing all means of defense and storage. They must carry no *arton* (bread) for the belly nor *argurion* (silver) for trade. The prohibition of *duo chitonas* (two tunics) strikes against the preparation for future comfort or the luxury of a change of clothes. The apostle must walk naked of worldly assurance, clothed only in Providence.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και ειϲ ην αν οικι ειϲελθητε ε μινατε και ε εξερχε

**English Translation**
And into whatever house you enter, there remain, and from there depart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Stability of heart is enjoined. The Lord commands *e minate* (there remain). The itinerant preacher is tempted to move from house to house, seeking a richer table or softer bed. By commanding them to stay in the first house (*oiki*) that receives them until they leave the city (*exerche*), Christ mortifies the desire for better accommodation. Gratitude for the first offer of hospitality is the mark of a humble servant.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και οϲοι αν μη δεχωνται ϋμαϲ εξερχομενοι εκ τηϲ πολεωϲ εκι τον κονιορ απο των ποδ ϋμων αποτιναϲ ειϲ μαρτυρι μαρτυρι αυτοιϲ επ αυτουϲ επ αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And as many as do not receive you, going out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment of rejection is severe. We see the scribe struggling with the weight of this verse, repeating *marturi* (testimony) and *ep autous* (against them). To shake off the *koniorton* (dust) signifies that the apostles take nothing from that city—not even its soil clings to them. It is a separation of communion. The city that rejects the Kingdom is left wholly to itself, a terrible isolation witnessed by the very dust of the earth.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
εξερχομενοι δε δι κατα κω ευαγγελιζο και θεραπευ πανταχου

**English Translation**
And going out they passed through the villages, evangelizing and healing everywhere.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is fulfilled in action. They passed through (*di* for *dierchonto*) the *komas* (villages). The twin duties are present: *euaggelizomenoi* (evangelizing) the soul and *therapeuontes* (healing) the body. The word *pantachou* (everywhere) indicates the universality of the mission; the light of the Gospel is not confined to the synagogue but spreads through the rural hamlets, leaving no corner in darkness.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ηκουϲεν δε ηρω ο τετρααρχηϲ τα γεινομενα παντα και διηπο δια το λεγεϲθαι ϋπο τινων οτι ϊ ηγερθη εκ νεκρων

**English Translation**
Now Herod the tetrarch heard all the things happening; and he was perplexed because it was said by some that John was raised from the dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The conscience of the tyrant is easily disturbed. Herod hears of the miracles and is *dieporei* (thoroughly perplexed). Why? Because guilt creates ghosts. The text abbreviates John as *I* (Ioannes), the man Herod murdered. The rumor that John has been raised (*egerthe*) strikes terror, for a resurrected prophet is a judge whom the sword cannot kill a second time.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
τινων δε οτι ηλει εφανη αλλων δε οτι προ τιϲ των αρ ανεϲτη

**English Translation**
And by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that a certain prophet of the ancients had risen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The people grasp at shadows of the Old Covenant to explain the New Light. They speak of *Hlei* (Elias/Elijah) or a *pro* (prophet) of the *ar* (ancients/archaion). They sense the ancient power of God returning to Israel. They understand that Jesus is not a scribe or a Pharisee, but stands in the stream of those who spoke with fire from heaven. Yet, they fail to see He is the Lord of the prophets.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ηρωδηϲ εγω α τιϲ δε εϲτιν ουτοϲ περι ου ακοιω ακουω τοιαυτα και εζητει αυ

**English Translation**
And Herod said: I [beheaded John]; but who is this concerning whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the chilling abbreviation in the Codex: *ego a*. The scribe curtails the gruesome confession "I beheaded" (*apekephalisa*), as if the act is too known or too dark to write fully. Herod asserts his "I" (*ego*)—the pride of the ruler. He seeks to see (*idein*) Jesus, not out of faith, but out of a curiosity mingled with dread. He wishes to measure this new threat against his earthly power.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και ϋποϲτρεψαντεϲ οι αποϲτολοι διη αυτω α εποιηϲαν εποιηϲεν και παραλαβων αυτουϲ ϋπεχωρη κατ ϊδιαν ειϲ τοπον ερημον π̣ολ̣ι̣ν καλουμενην β̣ηδʼ̣ϲαϊδα τοπον ερημον

**English Translation**
And having returned, the apostles related to him what things they had done. And taking them, he withdrew privately into a desert place [of a city] called Bethsaida.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The apostles return to the Source. They relate (*diegesanto*) their deeds, but Christ leads them to solitude. The Codex here is tumultuous: it writes *polin* (city) then dots it for correction, preferring *topon eremon* (desert place) twice. This textual struggle reflects the spiritual reality: Bethsaida was a city, yet Christ sought the *eremon*—the wilderness within or near it. He teaches us that after great ministry, the soul must retreat to the desert to be with God, lest pride in "what they had done" take root.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
οι δε οχλοι γνον ηκολουθηϲ αυτω και αποδεξαμενοϲ αυτουϲ ελαληϲεν αυτοιϲ περι τηϲ βα του και τουϲ χρειαν εχον θεραπειαϲ ϊα

**English Translation**
But the crowds, knowing it, followed him; and having welcomed them, he spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and those having need of healing he cured.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the inexhaustible compassion of the Savior. He sought rest, but when the crowds followed, He *apodexamenous* (welcomed) them. There is no annoyance in Christ. He feeds them first with doctrine—speaking of the *ba* (Kingdom) *tou* (of God)—and then with mercy, healing (*iasato*) their bodies. The teaching of the Kingdom precedes the healing of the flesh, establishing the hierarchy of goods.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
η δε ημερα ηρξαντο ηρξατο κλινειν προϲελ δε οι δω ειπον αυτω απολυϲον τον ο τουϲ οχλουϲ τον οχλον ϊνα πορευ ειϲ ταϲ κυκλω κωμαϲ κ(αι) αγρουϲ καταλυϲω και ευρωϲιν επιϲιτιϲμον ο ωδε εν ερημω τοπω εϲμεν

**English Translation**
And the day began to decline; and the twelve coming up said to him: Dismiss the crowd, that going into the surrounding villages and fields they may lodge and find provisions, for here we are in a desert place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The day declines (*klinein*), and with the light, the faith of the Twelve dims. They see the *eremo topo* (desert place) and the lack of *episitismon* (provisions). Their solution is dispersion: "Dismiss them." They look to the *komas* (villages) of men for sustenance. They have just returned from casting out demons (v. 1-6), yet they do not trust the Master to provide bread in the wilderness. It is the eternal struggle of the material eye against the spiritual reality.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτοιϲ δο αυτοιϲ ϋμειϲ φα οι δε ειπαν ουκ ειϲιν ημιν πλειονεϲ αρτοι πεντε πλειον η πεντε αρτοι και ϊχθυεϲ δυο ει μητι πορευ ημιϲ αγο ειϲ π π τον λαον τουτ τουτ βρωματα

**English Translation**
He said but to them, give to them you [yourselves] to eat. But they said: There are not to us more loaves five, more than five loaves and fishes two; unless going we buy for a- all the people this [this] food.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine imperative clashing with human poverty. The Lord commands "Give ye," yet the disciples possess only the scarcity of nature—"not more than five loaves." The scribe’s repetition ("more than five loaves," "this this") mirrors the anxiety of the apostles, stammering over their lack of provision. We learn here that the command of God is not limited by the resources of man; the "five" and "two" are sufficient when placed in the hands of the Creator, even if we must buy food for "all" (abbreviated *pantas*) the people.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε γαρ δε ωϲει αν πεντακιϲχι ειπεν δε προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου κατακλινατε αυ κλιϲιαϲ ωϲει ανα πεντηκον

**English Translation**
For they were indeed about men five thousand. But he said to his disciples: Make them recline [in] companies about by fifty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitude is vast ("five thousand"), yet the Shepherd requires order, not chaos. He commands them to recline in "companies" (*klisias*), grouping them by fifty. This signifies the liturgical order of the Church; we are fed not as a mob, but as organized portions of the Lord's flock. The specific number fifty recalls the Jubilee and Pentecost—a number of remission and the Spirit, preparing the soul for the bread of heaven.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και εποιηϲαν ουτωϲ και κατε πανταϲ

**English Translation**
And they did so, and made recline all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A verse of pure obedience. There is no argument, only the action: "they did so." The abbreviation *kate* (for *kateklinan*) suggests the swiftness of their compliance. Before the bread is multiplied, the people must be seated in faith. Rest precedes the miracle; we must cease our labor and sit in the presence of God to receive His bounty.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
λαβων δε τουϲ π π αρτουϲ και τουϲ δυο ϊχθυαϲ ανα ειϲ τον ου ευλογηϲεν και κατεκλαϲεν και εδιδου τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ παρα τω οχλω

**English Translation**
But taking the f- five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to the heaven, he blessed and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Eucharistic archetype. He takes the earthly element, looks "up to the heaven" (*eis ton ouranon*), acknowledging the Source, and blesses. The breaking signifies the Passion, for the bread must be broken to be shared. Note the mediation: He gives not directly to the crowd, but "to the disciples to set before." The priesthood is established here as the stewards of the mysteries, distributing the broken Bread of Life to the waiting world.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και εφαγον και ε π π και ηρθη το πε των κλαϲματων κοφι δωδεκα

**English Translation**
And they ate and w- f- f- [were filled], and was taken up that which r- [remained] of fragments, baskets twelve.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters with the abundance (*e p p* for *echortasthesan*). They were not merely fed; they were filled. The "twelve baskets" (*kophinoi*) remaining signify that the grace of Christ is inexhaustible; after Israel is fed, there remains a full portion for the twelve tribes of the new Israel, the Church. Nothing of the spiritual gift is to be lost; even the fragments are gathered as holy treasures.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω ειναι αυτον εν τοπω προϲευχομεν κατα μοναϲ ϲυνη αυτω οι μαθη και επηρωτηϲεν αυτουϲ ο λεγ τινα με οι οχλοι λεγουϲιν λεγουϲιν οι οχλοι ειναι

**English Translation**
And it came to pass, in his being in a place praying alone, were with him the disciples; and he asked them, the [one] saying: Whom do the crowds say [say the crowds] [me] to be?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Solitude and community intersect. He is "praying alone" (*kata monas*), yet the disciples are "with him." The mystery of Christ's identity is revealed in the atmosphere of prayer. He asks not for His own knowledge, but to draw out the confession of the disciples. The repetition "say the crowds" emphasizes the noisy, confused chatter of the world regarding the Word, which stands in contrast to the silence of His prayer.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
οι δε αποκριθεν ειπαν ϊωαν τον βαπτιϲτ βαπτιϲτ αλλοι δε ηλιαν αλ δε οτι προφητηϲ τιϲ των αρχαιων ανεϲτη

**English Translation**
But answering they said: John the Baptist [Baptist]; but others Elijah; but oth- [others] that a prophet certain of the ancients has risen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world looks backward, seeing only ghosts of the "ancients." They name John (the recently beheaded, emphasized by the scribe's stutter "Baptist Baptist") or Elijah. They cannot conceive of the New Thing God is doing; they can only interpret the Christ as a resurrection of the old Law or Prophecy. They see the shadow, but fail to recognize the Substance standing before them.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτοιϲ ϋ δε τινα με λε ειναι πετροϲ δε αποκρι ειπεν τον του

**English Translation**
But he said to them: But you, whom do you s- [say] [me] to be? But Peter answering said: The [Christ] of the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question turns from the "crowds" to "you" (*hymeis*)—the Church. Peter, the mouthpiece of the apostles, gives the confession. The manuscript abbreviates the holiest titles to "The of the" (*ton tou*), a sacred silence where the reader supplies "The Christ of God." This is the rock of faith: acknowledging Him not as a prophet, but as the Anointed One belonging uniquely to the Father.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ο δε επι αυτοιϲ παρηγγιλεν μη λεγειν του ι̣

**English Translation**
But he, admonishing them, charged [them] to tell this to no one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command of silence. The scribe writes "this" as *tou i* (likely *touto*), marking the specific content of the Messianic secret. Why silence? Because the confession of glory is dangerous without the understanding of the Cross. To proclaim Him King before He has suffered is to misunderstand His Kingdom. The mystery must be guarded in the heart until the Pascha is accomplished.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ειπων οτι τον του ανθρωπου δει δει τον του ανθρωπου πολλα παθειν και αποδοκιμαϲθη απο των πρε και αρ και γραμ και απο και τη τριτη ημερα εγερ

**English Translation**
Saying that the [Son] of Man must [must] suffer many things, and be rejected from the eld- [elders] and ch- [chief priests] and scr- [scribes], and be ki- [killed], and on the third day be ra- [raised].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine necessity (*dei*, repeated "must must") governs the Passion. The Son of Man is not a victim of circumstance but of a plan. The rejection comes from the very structures of religion—elders, priests, scribes—abbreviated here (*pre, ar, gram*) as if to hasten through the list of traitors. He points to the "third day" (*trite hemera*), the horizon of hope beyond the "suffering" and "killing."

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε προϲ π π ει τιϲ θελι οπι μου ερχεϲθαι ελθε ελθε αρνηϲαϲθω εαυ και αρατω τον ϲταυρον αυτου κα ημεραν καθ ημεραν και ακο μοι

**English Translation**
And he said to a- a- [all]: If anyone wills after me to come [come come], let him deny him- [himself], and let him take up the cross of him d- daily [daily], and fol- [follow] me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The condition of discipleship is universal ("to all") yet voluntary ("if anyone wills"). The stutter "come come" and the repetition "daily daily" (*kath hemeran*) emphasize the urgency and the persistence required. One must lift the *stauron*—the instrument of execution—not once, but perpetually. Self-denial is the only path to following the One who denied Himself glory to embrace the Cross.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ εαν θελη τ τ ψυχην αυτου ϲω απολεϲει αυτ αυτ ︴ οϲ δ αν απολεϲη την ψυχην αυτου ενεκεν εμου ου ϲωϲει αυτην

**English Translation**
For whoever wills th- the life of him to sa- [save], shall lose it [it]; {mark} but whoever shall lose the life of him for my sake, th- [this one] shall save it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The great reversal. To grasp at the soul (*psychen*) is to strangle it; to release it for the sake of the Christ is to secure it eternally. The scribe uses "ou" (normally "not", but here representing *outos*, "this one") before "shall save," creating a visual paradox: the one who loses appears to be "not" saving, yet is the very one who *does* save. This is the logic of martyrdom: death is the gateway to life.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
τι γαρ ωφελει ανθρω κερδηϲαϲ τον κοϲμον ολον ε δε απολε η ζημιωθειϲ

**English Translation**
For what does it profit a man, having gained the whole world, but having destroyed or forfeited himself?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the stark economy of salvation presented here. The text abbreviates *anthropos* (man) to `ανθρω` and *eauton* (himself) to `ε`, compressing the human subject to its barest essence, just as the soul is compressed by the weight of worldly gain. To "gain the whole world" is an external accumulation, a swelling of the temporal; yet the verb `απολε` (destroy) and `ζημιωθειϲ` (forfeit) speak of an ontological subtraction. One cannot barter the cosmos for the *hypostasis* of the self; if the vessel is shattered, where shall the gain be stored?

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ αν επεϲχ επεϲχ με και τουϲ ε λογουϲ του ο του ανθρω επαιϲχυνθη οταν ελθη τη δοξη αυτου και του πατροϲ και τ τ αγιων αγγελων

**English Translation**
For whoever shall be ashamed—ashamed of me and my words, of him the Son of Man shall be ashamed when he comes in his glory, and [that] of the Father, and of the holy angels.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stutters `επεϲχ επεϲχ` (ashamed, ashamed), doubling the condemnation of cowardice. The abbreviation `του ο του ανθρω` (*tou uiou tou anthropou*) veils the mystery of the Incarnation in sacred shorthand: the Son of Man is the judge. Note the trinitarian light in the eschatology: He comes not merely in His own glory, but in the glory `του πατροϲ` (of the Father). The shame of the confessor on earth mirrors the shame of the Judge in heaven; reciprocity is the law of the Kingdom.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
λε δε ϋμιν αληθωϲ ειϲιν τινεϲ των αυτου εϲτηκοτ οι ου μη γευϲων θανατου εωϲ αν ϊδωϲι την βα του

**English Translation**
But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise is immediate: `την βα του` (*ten basileian tou [theou]*). The Kingdom is not a distant geography but a vision accessible to the purified eye even before the separation of soul and body. To "not taste death" before seeing implies that the vision of God (Theoria) is an antidote to the sting of mortality. Those standing (`εϲτηκοτ`) are about to witness the Transfiguration, which is the Kingdom made manifest in the uncreated light on Tabor.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε μετα τουϲ λογουϲ τουτουϲ ωϲει ημεραι οκτω κ(αι) παραλαβων πετρ και ϊωαννην και ϊακωβον ανεβη ειϲ το οροϲ προϲευ

**English Translation**
And it came to pass after these words, about eight days, and having taken Peter and John and James, he went up into the mountain to pray.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "eight days" (`ημεραι οκτω`) are significant; the number eight symbolizes the Ogdoad, the day beyond the cycle of the week, the day of Resurrection and eternity. He ascends the mountain specifically `προϲευ` (to pray). The Transfiguration is an act of prayer; the flesh of Christ becomes luminous through his communion with the Father, teaching us that true prayer is not merely petition, but transformation into light.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω προϲευξαϲθαι προϲευχεϲθαι αυ το ειδοϲ του προϲωπου αυτου εγενετο ετερον και ο ειματιϲμοϲ αυτου λευκοϲ εξα

**English Translation**
And it came to pass while he was praying [praying], the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing white, flashing like lightning.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles with the magnitude of the moment, writing `προϲευξαϲθαι προϲευχεϲθαι`—a repetition that emphasizes the duration and intensity of the divine communion. The alteration is total: the `ειδοϲ` (appearance) becomes `ετερον` (other/different). This is not a change of substance, but a revelation of hidden glory. The clothing becomes `λευκοϲ εξα` (*leukos exastrapton*), white and flashing out; the material creation (clothing) participates in the glory of the body it covers.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
και ϊ ανδρεϲ δυο ϲυ ϲ αυτω οι ηϲαν μωϋ και ηλειαϲ

**English Translation**
And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Law (`μωϋ`, Moses) and the Prophets (`ηλειαϲ`, Elijah) converge on the mountain. Their presence `ϲυ ϲ` (*synelaloun*, talking with) confirms that the Christ is the fulfillment of all scripture. They stand as witnesses from the living and the dead, testifying that the Lord of the Mountain rules over both realms. The abbreviation of their names in the text reflects their familiarity to the faithful reader; they are pillars of the old covenant bowing to the New.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
οι οφθεντεϲ εν δο ελεγον την εξο αυτου ην η πληρουν εν ϊερουϲαλημ

**English Translation**
Who, appearing in glory, were speaking of his exodus which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They appear `εν δο` (in glory), sharing by grace what Christ possesses by nature. Their topic is His `εξο` (*exodon*), His departure or death. It is a paradox: in the midst of the uncreated light, they discuss the Cross. The glory is not an escape from the Passion, but the preparation for it. He is to "fulfill" (`πληρουν`) this exodus, for the death of God is not a defeat but a completion of the divine economy.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πετροϲ και οι ϲυν αυτω ηϲαν βε ϋπνω διαγρηγορηϲαν δε ειδαν την δοξαν αυτου και τουϲ δυο ανδραϲ τουϲ ϲυνεϲτωταϲ ϲυνε αυ

**English Translation**
But Peter and those with him were weighed down with sleep; but having stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples are `βε` (*bebaremenoi*), weighed down by the heaviness of the flesh, unable to easily bear the weight of glory. Yet they `διαγρηγορηϲαν` (stayed awake/became fully awake). One must shake off the lethargy of the senses to perceive spiritual realities. They saw the glory only after overcoming the sleep; vigilance (`nepsis`) is the prerequisite for vision (`theoria`).

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο τω διαχωριζεϲθε αυτουϲ απ αυτου ειπεν ο πετροϲ προϲ τον επιϲτατα κα εϲτιν ημαϲ ω ειναι και ποιη ϲκηναϲ τριϲ ϲοι μιαν και μω μιαν και μι ηλια μη ειδωϲ ο λεγει

**English Translation**
And it came to pass as they were parting from him, Peter said to the Master, "It is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah," not knowing what he says.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, in his rapture, wishes to arrest the moment, to build `ϲκηναϲ` (tents) and fix the glory in place. He equates the Master (`επιϲτατα`) with the servants (`μω` and `ηλια`) by offering a tent to each. The text notes he spoke `μη ειδωϲ` (not knowing); he did not understand that the true Tabernacle is the flesh of Christ, which must be torn on the Cross to shelter the world. He sought to remain on the mountain, but the Gospel must descend to the valley of death.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα δε αυ λεγοντοϲ εγε νεφελη και επεϲκιαζεν αυτουϲ εφοβηθηϲαν δε εν τω ειϲελθειν αυτουϲ ειϲ την νε

**English Translation**
And as he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The `νεφελη` (cloud) is the Shekinah, the presence of the Spirit. It `επεϲκιαζεν` (overshadowed) them, just as the Spirit overshadowed the Virgin. The fear of the disciples is the appropriate response to the *mysterium tremendum*. To enter the cloud is to enter the darkness of unknowing where God dwells, beyond the concepts and tents of Peter's making.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και φωνη εγενετο εκ τηϲ νε λεγουϲα ου εϲτιν ο μου ο εκλελεγμενοϲ αυτου ακουετε

**English Translation**
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, the Chosen One; hear him."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Hear the specific reading of the Codex: `ο εκλελεγμενοϲ` (the Chosen One), distinct from "the Beloved" found in other traditions. This emphasizes the specific election of the humanity of Christ for the work of redemption. The command is absolute: `αυτου ακουετε` (hear Him). Moses and Elijah must fade; the Law and Prophets are silent now that the Word Himself speaks. The Father confirms the Son's identity to fortify the disciples against the scandal of the coming Cross.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
και εν τω γενεϲθαι την φωνην ευ μονοϲ κ(αι) αυτοι εϲιγηϲαν και ουδενι απηγ εν εκειναιϲ ταιϲ ημεραιϲ ου ων εωρακαϲ

**English Translation**
And when the voice had happened, [Jesus] was found alone. And they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days nothing of what they had seen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
After the revelation, Jesus is found `μονοϲ` (alone). The multiple witnesses vanish, leaving only the One who is All. The disciples' silence (`εϲιγηϲαν`) is necessary; such mysteries cannot be spoken until the Resurrection completes the `εξοδον`. Silence is the seal of the mystic experience; to chatter about the uncreated light before the time is to profane it. They held the vision in the treasury of their hearts, awaiting the day when the secret could be shouted from the rooftops.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε τη εξηϲ ημερα κατελθον αυτων απο του ορουϲ ϲυνην αυτω οχλοϲ πολυϲ

**English Translation**
And it happened on the next day, [as] they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the descent. The Lord does not remain in the transfigured glory of the mountain (*orous*), for charity compels Him downward. The vision of glory is given to the few, but the ministry of presence belongs to the "large crowd" (*ochlos polys*) in the valley. We, too, must descend from contemplation to serve the chaotic needs of the multitude.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου α απο του οχλου εβοηϲεν λεγων διδαϲκαλε δεομαι ϲου επιβλεψον επι τον μου οτι μο μοι εϲτ εϲτ

**English Translation**
And behold, a man from the crowd shouted, saying, "Teacher, I beg you, look upon my [son], for he is to me... is... is [my only child]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here bears the marks of great distress. The scribe’s hand stutters (`μο μοι εϲτ εϲτ`), reflecting the broken speech of the father. The man cries out regarding his "only" one (*monogenes* is implied in the fragmented *mo*), mirroring the Father’s love for the Only-Begotten who now stands before him. The plea "look upon" (*epiblepson*) suggests that the mere gaze of the Divine is sufficient for salvation.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και π λαμβανει αυτον και εξαιφνηϲ κραζει και ραϲϲει και ϲπαραϲϲει αυτ μετα αφρου και μο αποχωρει απ αυ ϲυντριβουν ϲυντριβον ϲυντριβον αυ

**English Translation**
And a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it dashes and convulses him with foam, and hardly departs from him, crushing... crushing... crushing him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The abbreviation `π` signifies the *pneuma* (spirit), but here it is a spirit of malice. Note the terrifying repetition in the manuscript: `ϲυντριβον ϲυντριβον` (crushing, crushing). The Enemy is relentless in grinding down the image of God in man. It does not merely afflict; it seeks to pulverize the vessel. This is the nature of evil: a monotonous, crushing weight that refuses to depart.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και εδεηθην των μαθητων ϲου ϊνα εκβαλωϲιν αυ και ουκ ηδυνηθη

**English Translation**
And I begged your disciples that they might cast it out, and they were not able.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A humbling record for the diaconate and presbyterate. The disciples, separated from the Master (who was on the mountain), found their derived authority insufficient. Power in the Church is not a static possession but a dynamic flow from Christ; when the connection is tenuous, the ability to expel darkness vanishes.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ειπεν ω γεναια α και διεϲτραμ εωϲ ποτε με υμων εϲομαι και ανεξομαι προϲαγαγε μοι ωδε τ ϋϊον ϲου

**English Translation**
And answering, Jesus said, "O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here to me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord expresses a holy weariness. The abbreviation `α` likely stands for *apistos* (faithless). He is the Physician surrounded by patients who refuse the cure. Yet, His frustration does not lead to abandonment. The command "Bring your son here to me" is the ultimate pastoral directive: when human ministry fails, we must carry the suffering directly to the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
ετι δε προϲ προϲερχομενου αυτου ερρηξεν αυτον το δαιμονιον και ϲυνεϲπαραξεν ε δε ο τω τω ακαθαρ και τον παιδα και απεδω αυτον τω πα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And while he was yet coming, the demon dashed him down and convulsed [him] together. But Jesus rebuked the unclean [spirit], and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters `προϲ προϲερχομενου` (coming, coming), emphasizing the difficulty of the approach. The devil attacks most violently at the threshold of deliverance. But observe the restoration: Christ does not keep the healed boy for His own retinue but "gave him back to his father." Grace restores natural bonds; it heals the domestic church.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
εξεπληϲ δε παντεϲ επι τη μεγαλιοτη του παντων δε θαυμαζοντ επι παϲιν οιϲ εποι εποιει ειπεν προϲ τουϲ μαθη αυτου

**English Translation**
And all were astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marveling at all the things which he was doing, he said to his disciples:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd sees the `μεγαλιοτη` (majesty/greatness), but Jesus immediately pivots to the Cross. He refuses to let the disciples become intoxicated by the miraculous. While the world marvels at power (`εποιει`), the Master prepares them for weakness. True theology is not found in the applause of the crowd but in the secret instruction regarding the Passion.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
θεϲθε ϋ ειϲ τα ωτα ϋ τουϲ λογουϲ τουτουϲ ο γαρ του ανθρωπου μελλει παραδιδοϲθαι ειϲ χιραϲ ανθρωπων

**English Translation**
"Place these words into your ears: for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"Place into your ears"—let them sink deep, past the hearing and into the heart. The contrast is stark: The One who just displayed the "Majesty of God" is to be delivered into the "hands of men" (`χιραϲ ανθρωπων`). The Creator submits to the judgment of the creature. This is the mystery of the Kenosis.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ηγνοουν το ρημα τουτο και ην παρακεκαλυμ απ αυτων ϊνα μη εϲθωνται αυτο και εφοβουν ερωτηϲαι αυτ αυτ περι του ρηματοϲ τουτου

**English Translation**
But they were ignorant of this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they might not perceive it; and they feared to ask him about this saying.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ignorance here is partly providential (`παρακεκαλυμ` - concealed). There are truths we cannot bear until the Resurrection illuminates them. Yet, there is also a culpable fear; they "feared to ask." They preferred the comfort of ignorance to the terrifying clarity of the Truth. We must guard against such cowardice in our own study of the Scriptures.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ειϲηλθεν δε διαλογιϲμοϲ ε αυτοιϲ το τιϲ αν ειη μιζον αυτων

**English Translation**
And a reasoning entered among them, as to which of them might be greater.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the immediate fruit of carnal thinking. While the Lord speaks of being "betrayed into hands," the disciples argue about being `μιζον` (greater). Pride is the parasite that feeds on the proximity to the Holy. Even in the shadow of the predicted Cross, the desire for ecclesiastical rank asserts itself.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειδωϲ τον διαλογιϲμον τηϲ καρδιαϲ αυτων επιλαβομενοϲ παιδιου εϲτηϲεν αυτο παρ εαυτω

**English Translation**
But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their heart, having taken hold of a child, stood him by himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He reads the `καρδιαϲ` (heart). He does not need their spoken words; the internal "reasoning" is loud to Him. His rebuke is silent and visual: He places a child (`παιδιου`) "by himself" (*par heauto*). To be near Jesus is to be like the child—powerless, dependent, and without status.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ οϲ εαν δεξηται του το πεδιον επι τω ονοματι μου εμε δεχεται και οϲ εμε δεχεται δεχε τον αποϲτιλ αποϲτιλ με ο γαρ μεικρο εν παϲιν ϋ ϋπαρχων ου εϲτιν μεγαϲ

**English Translation**
And said to them, "Whoever receives this child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, receives him who sent me. For the one who is least among all of you, this one is great."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes `πεδιον` (child) and stutters on `αποϲτιλ` (sent), perhaps trembling at the weight of the theology. Here is the Great Inversion. The `μεικρο` (least/small) is the `μεγαϲ` (great). To receive the small is to receive the Infinite God. Authority in the Church is not ascending to a throne, but descending to the cradle.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ειπεν ε ειδομεν τινα εν τω ονο ϲου εκβαλλον δαιμονια και εκωλυομεν αυ οτι ουκ ακολου μεθ ημων

**English Translation**
But answering, the [one] said, "M[aster], we saw someone in your name casting out demons and we forbade h[im], because he does not follow with us."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the text’s abruptness; the speaker is designated merely by the article "ο" (the), and the address to the Lord is truncated to "ε"—likely a suspended *Epistata* (Master). The scribe hurries, reflecting the anxiety of the disciples. They guard the "Name" (*onomati*) as a possession of their circle ("with us"), yet the power of that Name operates outside their jurisdiction. We see here the tension between ecclesiastical order and the free-flowing Spirit; the disciples wish to monopoly the exorcism, but the Name itself defies their boundaries.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυ ο μη κωλυετε οϲ γαρ ουκ εϲτιν καθ υμων ϋπερ η ημων ϋπερ υμων υμων υπερ υμων εϲτιν

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] said to h[im], "Do not forbid; for whoever is not against you is for... us... for you... you... for you is."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the great stumbling of the scribe in this holy Codex! The text stammers repeatedly between "us" (*hemon*) and "you" (*hymon*), writing "for you" and "for us" in a chaotic loop. It is as if the very parchment trembles at the wideness of the Lord's mercy. Is the outsider for *us* (the apostles) or for *you* (the church)? The Spirit allows the pen to slip to show that in the economy of salvation, the distinction dissolves; he who is not against the Truth is a worker for the Truth, whether for "us" or for "you."

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν τω ϲυμπληρουϲθαι ταϲ ημεραϲ τηϲ α αυτου και αυτοϲ το προϲω αυτου εϲτη του πορευε ειϲ ϊερουϲα

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in the fulfilling [of] the days of his a[scension], and he his face set to go to Jerusa[lem].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates the great mystery of the *analempseos* (ascension/assumption) to a single letter "α". This alpha marks the beginning of the end of His earthly walk. Note the fixity of purpose: "he his face set" (*esterisen*). Like a flint, the Divine Countenance turns toward the city of slaughter. He does not drift toward the Cross; He marches. The destination "Jerusa[lem]" is cut short in the text, for the earthly city is but a fragment of the heavenly reality He approaches.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
και απεϲτιλ αγγελουϲ προ προ αυτου και πορευθεντεϲ ειϲηλ ειϲ πολιν κωμην ϲα ωϲ ωϲτε ετοι αυτω

**English Translation**
And he sent messengers be[fore] his face; and having gone they entered into a city [village] of Sa[maritans], so as to prepare for him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is confused, reading *polin komën*—"city village." The scribe conflates the magnitude of a city with the humility of a village. These messengers enter hostile territory, the land of the *Samariton* (abbreviated *Sa*). The repetition of "before" (*pro pro*) emphasizes the prophetic forerunner nature of the apostles. They go to "prepare," just as the Baptist did, yet here the preparation meets a stone wall.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
και ου εδεξαντο αυτον οτι το προϲωπον αυτου ην πορευο ειϲ ϊερου

**English Translation**
And they did not receive him, because his face was going into Jeru[salem].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rejection is Christological and geographical. They do not reject Him for His teaching, but for His orientation. His face is turned toward Zion, and the mountain of Gerizim cannot abide the choice of Jerusalem. It is the "face" (*prosopon*) that offends. When the Church turns her face resolutely toward the Cross, the world—like this Samaritan village—shuts its doors.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
ϊδοντεϲ δε οι μαθηται ϊα και ϊωαν ειπαν θε ειπωμεν πυρ καταβηναι απο του ουρανου και ανα αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And seeing, the disciples Ja[mes] and John said, "Go[d]?, shall we speak fire to come down from heaven and cons[ume] them?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A startling reading! Where other texts read *Kyrie* (Lord), our Codex writes *The* (ΘΕ), likely a vocative for *Theos* (God). The Sons of Thunder address Jesus directly as God, demanding divine judgment. They wish to act as Elijah, calling down fire to *analosai* (consume) the inhospitable. Their theology is high—they know He is God—but their anthropology is low; they know not mercy. They wish to burn the village that the Lord intends to save.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
ϲτραφειϲ δε επετι αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
But having turned, he rebuked them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Silence speaks louder than additions. Our Codex Sinaiticus omits the later glosses ("You know not what spirit you are of..."). Here, the rebuke is absolute and stark. *Epetimesen*—He censured them. The text offers no explanation, no softening dialogue. The silence of the parchment after the rebuke mirrors the silence imposed upon the disciples' rash violence. The Bishop reads this as a total negation of holy war in the name of Christ.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
και επορευθηϲαν ειϲ ε κωμην

**English Translation**
And they went into a[nother] village.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "ε" stands for *eteran* (another). The solution to rejection is not fire, but migration. They simply move on. This is the humility of the Incarnation; the Creator is refused lodging by His creatures, and He walks to the next hamlet without retaliation.

**Verse 57**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) πορευομενων αυ εν τη οδω ει τιϲ προϲ αυτ αυτ ακολουθηϲω ϲοι οπου αν απερχη

**English Translation**
And as th[ey] were going on the way, someone said to h[im], "I will follow you wherever you go."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stutters again with *aut aut* (to him him), perhaps trembling at the audacity of the promise. The anonymous "someone" makes a total offering of self—"wherever you go." But he knows not that the "way" (*hodo*) leads to the skull. It is easy to promise following when the road is flat; the Lord is about to reveal the topography of hardship.

**Verse 58**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτω ο αι αλωπεκεϲ φω εχουϲιν και τα πετινα του ουρα καταϲκηνω ο δε του αν ουκ εχει που την κεφαλ κεφαλ κλινη

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] said to him, "The foxes have ho[les] and the birds of heav[en] ne[sts], but the Son of M[an] does not have where he may lay the head."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *kephal* (head) twice at the end. The "Head" of the Church has no place for His physical head. The *alopekes* (foxes) have their earth, the *peteina* (birds) their air, but the Creator has emptied Himself of all property. He is the stranger in His own creation. The repetition of "head" emphasizes the weariness of the Logos; He seeks a resting place, which He shall only find upon the hard wood of the Cross, bowing His head to die.

**Verse 59**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ ετε ακολουθει μοι ο δε ειπεν επι μοι πρω απελθοντι θαψαι τον πατερα μου

**English Translation**
And he said to anoth[er], "Follow me." But he said, "Per[mit] me fi[rst], having gone away, to bury my father."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is direct: *Akolouthei moi*. The response is delayed: *Proton* (first). Here is the conflict of duties. To bury a father is a holy obligation of the Law. Yet, the presence of the Living God supersedes the obligations to the dead. The disciple wants to go "away" (*apelthonti*) before coming "to" Christ. In the Kingdom, there is no "first" other than the King.

**Verse 60**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτω αφεϲ τουϲ νεκρουϲ θαψαι τουϲ εαυτων νε ϲυ δε απελ διαγγελλε τ τ βαϲιλειαν του

**English Translation**
But he said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own de[ad]; but you, having gone away, announce t[he] kingdom of [God]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sentence ends abruptly with "of the..." (*tou*), implying *Theou* (God), yet the word is absent, as if the Kingdom is beyond naming. The command is radical: *Aphes* (leave/forgive/abandon). Let the spiritually dead bury the physically dead. The call to the priesthood of the believer is a call to *Diaggelle* (announce thoroughly). While the world tends to its graves, the disciple must tend to the proclamation of Life. The stutter "t t" (the the) before Kingdom highlights the urgency—the Kingdom is here, now, and waits for no funeral rites.

**Verse 61**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε και ετεροϲ ακολουθηϲω ϲοι πρωτον δε επι μοι απο τοιϲ ειϲ τ οικον μου

**English Translation**
And another said, "I will follow you; but first [let it be] upon me [to go] from the [ones] into my house."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the heavy yoke of the worldly will. The scribe records the phrase *epi moi* ("upon me"), suggesting that the man views his familial duty not merely as a task, but as a burden resting upon his own person, weighing him down before he can ascend to discipleship. He speaks of going *apo tois* ("from the [things/ones]") *eis t oikon* ("into the house"). There is a spiritual danger in this movement: he wishes to go *into* the enclosure of the house, whereas the call of the Lord is always to go *out* into the harvest. The text, abrupt and rugged, highlights the friction between the "me" upon whom the duty rests and the "you" (Christ) whom he claims he wishes to follow. He places the "first" (*proton*) on his own affairs, delaying the primacy of the Kingdom.

**Verse 62**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυτ ο ουδιϲ επιβαλ επιβαλ την χειρα αυτου επ αροτρον και βλεπων ειϲ τα ο ευθετοϲ εϲ εν τη βαϲιλεια του

**English Translation**
But [he] said to [him/it]: "No one putting, putting his hand upon a plow and looking into the [things behind] is fit in the kingdom of the [One]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here bears the marks of a profound spiritual struggle, mirrored in the very ink. We read *epibal epibal* ("putting, putting")—a doubling that mimics the hesitation of a hand trembling as it grasps the wood, or perhaps the necessity of re-gripping the plow when the will falters. The Lord’s rebuke is severe against the divided heart. The text reads *blepon eis ta o* ("looking into the..."), cutting off the object of the gaze, as if the very "things behind" are not worthy even to be named in full, or perhaps signifying that looking back leads only to *o* (nothingness). Finally, the verse concludes *en te basileia tou* ("in the kingdom of the..."), leaving the genitive open. It is the Kingdom of the *Tou*—the Definite Article pointing to the Ineffable God, He who requires no name, for He is the sole possessor of the Kingdom. To be fit (*euthetos es*) is to exist wholly in this possession, without the stutter of the double-grasp or the backward glance.
