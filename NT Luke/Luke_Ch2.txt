**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ εκιναιϲ εξηλθεν δογμα παρα καιϲαροϲ α απογρα παϲαν την οικουμενην ˙

**English Translation**
And it happened in those days, a decree went out from Caesar A[ugustus] to regis[ter] all the inhabited world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the collision of two empires. The earthly ruler, Caesar, issues a *dogma* (decree) to count the world, an act of pride and possession. The text here is fragmented—*para Kaisaros A...*—as if the very name of the earthly potentate crumbles before the eternal event about to unfold. The scribe’s hesitation on *apogra* (to register) suggests the reluctance of the faithful to be numbered among the kingdoms of men, for our citizenship is in the heavens.

**Verse 2**


**Greek Text**
αυ απογραφην αυτη απογραφη αυτη η απογραφη εγενετο πρωτη πρωτη εγενετο ηγεμονευοντοϲ τηϲ ϲυριαϲ κυρηνι

**English Translation**
Th[is] census, this census, this the census happened first, first [it] happened [while] Cyrenius was governing Syria.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here stammers, repeating *apographē* (census) and *prōtē* (first) multiple times. It is a textual stutter reflecting the confusion of the world. Just as the scribe struggles to fix the historical moment—was it this census? was it the first?—so too does human history struggle to comprehend the entrance of the Timeless into time. The repetition emphasizes the historicity; this was not a myth, but a concrete event under Cyrenius, yet the scribal hand trembles at the significance.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και επορευον εκαϲτοϲ απογρα παντεϲ απογραφεϲθαι εκαϲτοϲ ειϲ την εαυ εαυτου πολιν

**English Translation**
And they were going, each... to regis... all to be registered, each into his ow[n]... own city.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the movement of the masses, driven by the edict. The text reads *eporeuon* (they were journeying). The fragmentation *apogra... pantes...* (to regis... all...) paints a picture of a disrupted populace. The correction *eis tēn eau... heautou polin* (into his own... own city) reinforces the return to one's roots. Spiritually, we must all return to our "own city," our true origin in God, to be registered not in Caesar’s books, but in the Book of Life.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ανεβη δε και ϊωϲηφ απο τηϲ γαλιλαι εκ πολεωϲ να ειϲ την ϊου ειϲ την πο ητιϲ καλει βηθλεεμ δια το ειναι αυτον ε οικου και πατρι

**English Translation**
And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from [the] city of Na[zareth], into Ju[dea], into the ci[ty] which is called Bethlehem, because he was o[f] the house and line[age]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Joseph ascends (*anebē*). Even the geography serves the theology; one always goes "up" toward the site of revelation. The text is abbreviated—*Na* for Nazareth, *Iou* for Judea—hastening the narrative toward the crucial destination: Bethlehem, the House of Bread. He goes because he is *ex oikou* (of the house) of David. The lineage is essential; the Messiah must come from the root of Jesse, fulfilling the ancient prophecies even amidst the bureaucratic chaos of a Roman census.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
απογραφε απογραψαϲϲθαι ϲυν μαριαμ τη εμνηϲτευμενη μεμνηϲτευμενη εμνηϲτευμενη αυτω ουϲη ενκυ

**English Translation**
To regis... to be registered with Mary, the betrothed, betrothed, betrothed to him, being pregn[ant].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe is seized by the mystery of Mary’s status, writing *emnēsteumenē* (betrothed) three times in various forms. This triple repetition acts as a seal upon her virginity and her lawful union to Joseph. She is not merely a companion but the *betrothed*, sanctified and set apart. *Ousē enky[ō]* (being pregnant) is the scandal and the glory; she carries the fullness of the Godhead bodily, a heaviness that weighs upon the text itself.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν τω ειναι αυτουϲ ε επληϲθηϲαν αι ημεραι του τεκ τεκ αυτην

**English Translation**
And it happened while they were th[ere], the days were fulfilled for her to give bir... give bir[th].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Eplēsthēsan* (were fulfilled). The time of waiting, stretching from Eve to this moment, is full. The stutter on *tek... tekein* (to give birth) indicates the arrival of the ineffable. The physical birth is imminent. We see here the convergence of divine timing (*kairos*) with human time (*chronos*). The days are accomplished not just for her, but for all creation groaning for redemption.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και ετεκ τον αυτηϲ τον πρωτοτοκον και εϲπαργανωϲεν αυτον και ανεκλι αυτον επι εν εν φατνη διοτι ουκ αυτοιϲ τοποϲ εν τω καταλυματι

**English Translation**
And she gave birth [to] her firstborn, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him upon... in... in a manger, because [there was] not for them a place in the guest-chamber.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She gave birth to the *prōtotokon* (firstborn), implying his pre-eminence over all creation. She *esparganōsen* (swaddled) him—the Binder of the Cosmos is bound in cloth. The text corrects itself: *epi... en... en phatnē* (upon... in... in a manger). He is placed in the feed-trough, for He is the Bread of Life given for the food of the faithful. There was no place in the *katalymati* (inn/guest-room), signifying that the world, in its fullness of business and noise, has no room for its Creator.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και ποιμαινεϲ ηϲ εν τη χωρα τη αυ αγραυλουντεϲ και φυλαϲϲοντεϲ φυλακαϲ τηϲ νυ επι την ποι αυτων

**English Translation**
And shepherds were in the sa[me] country, living in the fields and keeping watches of the ni[ght] over their flo[ck].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
God reveals Himself to the humble. *Poimenes* (shepherds), those who keep watch while the world sleeps, are the first recipients of the Gospel. They are *agraulountes* (living in the open fields), exposed to the elements, just as Christ has exposed Himself to our mortality. They keep watch *tēs ny[ktos]* (of the night); it is into the darkness of human ignorance that the Light is about to break.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
και αγγελοϲ επεϲτη αυτοιϲ και δοξα επελαμψεν αυτοιϲ περιελαμψεν αυτουϲ και εφοβη φοβον με

**English Translation**
And an angel stood by them, and glory shone upon them... shone around them, and they fea[red] a gr[eat] fear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text shows a correction from *epelampsen* (shone upon) to *perielampsen* (shone around). The glory of the Lord does not merely spot-light them; it encompasses them completely. It is an immersion in divine light. Their reaction is *phobon me[gan]* (great fear), the only appropriate response of the creature standing before the Uncreated Glory. The veil between heaven and earth is torn.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο αγγελοϲ μη φοβιϲθε ϊδου γαρ ευαγγελιζομαι ϋμιν χαραν μεγα ητιϲ εϲτιν εϲται παντι τω λαω

**English Translation**
And the angel said to them, "Do not fear; for behold, I announce good news to you, a gre[at] joy which is... shall be for all the people."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Mē phobeisthe* (Do not fear). The first command of the Incarnation is the banishment of terror. The angel brings *euangelizomai* (good news), a word appropriated from imperial victory announcements but here inverted for a spiritual victory. The scribe corrects *estin* (is) to *estai* (shall be), pointing to the future universality of this joy. It is for *panti tō laō* (all the people), not just the elite, but the entirety of the new Israel.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
οτι ετεχθη ϋμιν ϲημε ϲωτηρʼ οϲ εϲ εν πολι

**English Translation**
Because there was born to you toda[y] a Savior, who is... in [the] city...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The core of the Kerygma: *etechthē* (was born). The Almighty has become an infant. *Sēmer[on]* (today) marks the eternal now of salvation; every time we read this, Christ is born anew in the heart. He is *Sōtēr* (Savior). The text trails off at *hos es... en poli...* (who is... in city...). The titles "Christ Lord" and the name "David" are absent or cut from this specific line, leaving us with the raw ontological fact: The Savior *is* here, in the city of men.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και τουτο ημ υ̇μ το ϲημιον ευρηϲε βρεφοϲ εϲϲπαρ κ(αι) κειμενον επι εν φατνη

**English Translation**
And this [is] to u... to you the sign: You will find a baby swaddled and lying upon... in a manger.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *sēmion* (sign) is a paradox: God is found not in thunder, but as a *brephos* (infant), helpless and *esspar[ganōmenon]* (swaddled). The scribe fumbles *hēm... hymin* (to us... to you), perhaps realizing that the sign is given to "us" (the Church) through "you" (the shepherds). The final image rests again on the *phatnē* (manger). The Altar is prepared; the Lamb is ready.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και εξεφνηϲ εγενετο ϲυν τω αγγελω πληθοϲ ϲτρα ουρανιου αι τον και λεγοντων

**English Translation**
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising the [God] and saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the suddenness (`εξεφνηϲ`) of the divine incursion. The veil of the firmament is rent not by a single messenger, but by a `ϲτρα` (army/host) of the heavens. The text abbreviates the object of their praise (`αι τον`), yet the grammar demands the Divine Object. It is a martial gathering, not for war, but for liturgy; the army of the heights descends to join the humility of the earth, proving that the Lord of Hosts (`Sabaoth`) is now present in the flesh.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
δο εν υψιϲτοιϲ και επι γηϲ ϊρηνη εν ανθρωποιϲ ευ ευδοκια ευδοκια

**English Translation**
Glory in the highest [places] and upon earth peace among men [of] good good pleasure good pleasure.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the scribe, seized perhaps by the magnitude of the grace, stammers in ink: `ευ ευδοκια ευδοκια`. Three times the concept of "good" or "good pleasure" appears. It is not merely peace to all, but peace to those of `ευδοκια`—the men of His good will. The repetition emphasizes the superabundance of God’s intent; the "good pleasure" is no longer hidden in the cloud of the Law but is now poured out thrice-fold upon the earth.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο ωϲ α απ αυτ ειϲ τον ουρανον οι αγγελοι οι ποιμαι ελαλουν προϲ αλληλουϲ λεγον διελθωμεν δη εωϲ βηθλεεμ και ϊδωμεν το ρη τουτο το γεγονοϲ ο ο εγνωριϲεν ημιν

**English Translation**
And it came to pass as the angels [departed] from them into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another saying: Let us go through now unto Bethlehem and let us see this word that has happened, which the [Lord] made known to us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The angels ascend, but the `ρη` (word/matter) remains as a concrete fact (`γεγονοϲ`). The shepherds do not say "let us see this vision," but "let us see this *word*." In the Incarnation, the audible word becomes visible reality. The text reads `ο ο εγνωριϲεν`—a doubling of the article or an abbreviation for "which the Lord" (`ο κϲ`). It signifies that the revelation comes directly from the Source; the shepherds are the first theologians of the ocular proof.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και ηλθον ϲπευϲαντεϲ και ανευρον ανευραν ευραν την τε μαριαμ και τον ϊ και το βρε κειμενον εν τη φατνη

**English Translation**
And they came hastening and found—found—found both Mary and Jesus and the babe lying in the manger.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Look closely at the struggle of the scribe: `ανευρον ανευραν ευραν`. Three attempts to write "they found." Is this not a mirror of the shepherds' own breathless searching in the night? They sought until the reality was undeniable. They find the Mother, the Jesus (`ϊ`), and the `βρε` (babe). The distinction between "Jesus" and "the Babe" in the structure highlights both His personhood and His helpless infancy. He is fully God, yet lying in a feed trough.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ϊδοντεϲ δε εγνωριϲαν πε του ρηματοϲ του λαληθεντοϲ αυτοιϲ περι του παιδιου τουτου

**English Translation**
And seeing, they made known concerning the word spoken to them concerning this child.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Sight leads to proclamation. Having seen (`ϊδοντεϲ`), they make known. The "word" (`ρηματοϲ`) which was audible from the angels is now confirmed by the visible `παιδιου` (child). The shepherds are transformed from passive recipients of glory into active heralds of the Incarnation. They preach not a philosophy, but a `ρημα` concerning a specific Child.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και παντεϲ οι ακουϲαντεϲ ε περι των λαληθεντ λαληθεντ ϋπο των ποιμε προϲ αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And all those hearing [marveled] concerning the things spoken—spoken by the shepherds to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The abbreviation `ε` stands for `εθαυμασαν` (they marveled). The reaction to the Gospel is wonder. The text repeats `λαληθεντ` (spoken), emphasizing the oral testimony of the shepherds (`ποιμε`). The lowly are teaching the world; the keepers of sheep instruct the keepers of the Law, for the Shepherd of Souls has arrived.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
η δε μαρια μαριαμ παντα ϲυνετηρι τα ρη ταυτα ϲυνβαλ εν τη καρ αυτηϲ εαυτηϲ

**English Translation**
But Mary—Mariam—kept all these words pondering [them] in her heart—[her own] heart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe corrects `μαρια` to the Semitic `μαριαμ`, preserving her dignity. She does not merely hear; she `ϲυνετηρι` (preserves/keeps safe) these things. The word `ϲυνβαλ` implies "throwing together"—she is the first Christian scholar, assembling the fragments of prophecy and event in the vessel of her heart (`καρ`). The correction `αυτηϲ` to `εαυτηϲ` (her own) deepens the intimacy; this treasury was hers alone before it belonged to the Church.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και οι ποιμαι δοξαζοντεϲ και αινουντεϲ τ επι παϲιν οιϲ ηκουϲαν και ϊδον καθωϲ ελαληθη προϲ αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And the shepherds [returned] glorifying and praising [God] for all things which they heard and saw, just as it was spoken to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text omits the verb of motion (returned), focusing entirely on the action of the soul: `δοξαζοντεϲ` (glorifying). They praise `τ`—the Divine. The correspondence is perfect: what they heard (`ηκουϲαν`) matches exactly what they saw (`ϊδον`). In the mystery of Christ, the promise and the fulfillment are one flesh.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και ο επληϲθηϲαν ημεραι οκτω του περιτεμιν αυτον και εκληθη το ο αυτου το λεχθεν κληθεν ϋπο του αγγελου προ του ϲυλ αυτ αυτ εν τη κοιλια

**English Translation**
And when eight days were fulfilled to circumcise him, his name was also called [Jesus]—that spoken—called by the angel before he was conceived—he—in the womb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Law is honored in the `περιτεμιν` (circumcision). The Lord submits to the knife to prove the reality of His flesh against the Manichaeans who claim He was a phantom. The Name (`το ο`) is not chosen by men but given from on high. The stuttering repetition `αυτ αυτ` (him him) in the womb emphasizes His identity: He was the same Person before conception as He is now in the circumcision.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και ο επληϲθηϲαν επληρωθηϲαν επληϲθηϲαν αι ημεραι του καθα αυτων κα τον νομον μω ανηγαγον αυτον ειϲ ϊεροϲο παραϲτηϲε παραϲτηϲαι τω

**English Translation**
And when were fulfilled—filled up—fulfilled the days of their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present—to present [him] to the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the scribal labor: `επληϲθηϲαν επληρωθηϲαν επληϲθηϲαν`. Three times the "fulfillment" is written. The time of the Old Covenant is being filled to the brim. They bring Him to `ϊεροϲο` (Jerusalem) to present Him to `τω` (the Lord). He who is the Temple enters the temple; He who is the Lawgiver submits to the Law of `μω` (Moses).

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
καθωϲ γεγραπται εν νο οτι παν αρ διανοιγων διανοιγον μη αγιον τω κληθηϲεται

**English Translation**
Just as it is written in the law [of the Lord]: That every male opening—opening the womb shall be called holy to the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text cites the `νο` (Law). The phrase `διανοιγων` (opening) is corrected to `διανοιγον`. Christ is the Firstborn who "opens" not only the `μη` (womb) of the Virgin but the gates of Paradise. He is `αγιον` (holy) to the Lord by nature, yet He is offered as if He required sanctification, thereby sanctifying the very act of offering.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και του δουναι θυϲι κατα το ειρημεν εν τω νομω ζευγοϲ τρυγον η δυο νοϲϲουϲ πε

**English Translation**
And to give a sacrifice according to that stated in the law [of the Lord]: A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They offer the `θυϲι` (sacrifice) of the poor: `τρυγον` (turtledoves). The King of Glory possesses no gold, only the birds of the air. The `νοϲϲουϲ` (young ones) signify innocence. He enters the world in poverty so that through the `νομω` (Law) He might enrich us who are poor in spirit.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ανθρωποϲ ην ε ϊερουϲαλημʼ ω ονομα αυτου ϲυ και ο ανθρω ουτοϲ δικαιοϲ και ευϲεβηϲ ευλαβηϲ προϲ παρα του κ(αι) ην αγιον ε αυτον

**English Translation**
And behold, a man was in Jerusalem whose name [was] Sy[meon], and this man [was] righteous and pious, devout, looking for the [...] of the [Lord?], and [Spirit] Holy was upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the portrait of the faithful remnant. The text presents a man whose name is abbreviated to "Sy," yet whose character is written in full. He is not merely righteous (*dikaios*), but the scribe heaps upon him the titles of "pious" (*eusebes*) and "devout" (*eulabes*), a trinity of virtues marking a soul prepared for God. He is found "looking for" (*pros...*) something the text leaves unsaid, yet we know it is the Consolation. The Spirit (*agion*) rests upon him, not yet as an indwelling for all, but as a specific anointing for the prophetic witness.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και ην αυτω κεχρηματι ϋπο του του αγιου μη ϊδιν θανατον ε πριν η αν ϊδη τον

**English Translation**
And it was divinely revealed to him by the the Holy [Spirit] not to see death be[fore] he sees the [...].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the divine pact. The word *kechremati* implies a solemn oracle or divine warning. The Holy Spirit is the agent of this promise. The suspension of death is the burden of the prophet; he cannot close his eyes in the sleep of the earth until he has opened them to the Light of heaven. The text cuts off the object ("the..."), leaving the reader in the same posture as the seer: waiting to behold the unspoken Anointed One.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και ηλθεν εν τω ειϲ το ϊερον και εν τω ειϲαγαγειν τουϲ γο το παιδιον του ποιηϲαι αυτουϲ κατα το ειθιϲμεν του νομου περι αυτου

**English Translation**
And he came in the [...] into the temple; and in the bringing in [by] the pa[rents] the child, to do for them according to the custom of the law concerning him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Spirit leads the prophet "in the [Spirit]" to the Temple (*ieron*), the place of sacrifice. Simultaneously, the "parents" (*goneis*) bring the Child to fulfill the *nomou* (Law). See how the Old Covenant, represented by the custom (*eithismen*), meets the New Covenant, represented by the Child, within the physical structure of Israel's worship. Obedience to the Law provides the context for the revelation of Grace.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ δε εδεξατο αυτο ειϲ ταϲ αγκαλαϲ και ευλο τον και ειπεν

**English Translation**
And he himself received him into the arms and bles[sed] the [God] and said:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
It is not enough to see with the eyes; one must receive (*edexato*) with the heart and the body. The elder takes the Infant into his "arms" (*agkalas*). This is the embrace of humanity holding its Creator. He blesses (*eulo...*), for the appropriate response to holding the Word Incarnate is the eruption of praise. The silence of waiting is broken by the speech of benediction.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
νυν απολ απολυειϲ τον δουλον ϲου δεϲποτα κατα το ρημα ϲου εν ει

**English Translation**
Now you release your slave, Master, according to your word in pe[ace].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *Nunc Dimittis*. The prophet identifies himself as a *doulos* (slave) and God as *Despota* (absolute Master). The slave does not abandon his post; he requests dismissal (*apolyeis*). The vigil is concluded not by weariness, but by the fulfillment of the *rhema* (word). He departs "in peace" (*en ei...*), for the war between God and man is ended in the flesh of the Child he holds.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
οτι ειδον οι οφθαλμοι μου το ϲωτηριον ϲου

**English Translation**
Because my eyes saw your salvation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Salvation (*soterion*) is not a philosophy to be debated, but a Person to be seen (*eidon*). The physical eyes of the aged saint behold the spiritual reality of the ages. The abstract hope of Israel has become concrete, visible, and tangible. To see the Child is to see the Salvation of God.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ο ητοιμαϲαϲ κα προϲωπον π των λαων

**English Translation**
Which you prepared be[fore] the face of a[ll] the peoples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This salvation is not a hidden mystery for the few, but a public act prepared (*etoimasas*) by God. It is set "before the face" (*kata prosopon*) of "all the peoples" (*p... ton laon*). The scope of redemption explodes outward from the Temple courts to the ends of the earth. It is a universal preparation for a universal need.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
φωϲ ειϲ αποκαλυ εθνων και δο λαου ϲου

**English Translation**
A light for revelat[ion] of Gentiles and glo[ry] of your people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A dual prophecy. For the *ethnon* (Gentiles) who sit in darkness, Christ is the Light of *apokaly...* (revelation/unveiling). For Israel, "your people," He is the *do...* (glory). The Gentiles receive sight; Israel receives the weight of honor, for from them the Light has sprung. The wall of partition begins to crumble in this hymn of unity.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ην ο πατηρ αυτου και η μητηρ αυτου θαυμαζοντεϲ επι τοιϲ λαλουμενοιϲ περι αυτου

**English Translation**
And his father and his mother were marveling at the things being spoken concerning him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note that the text boldly calls Joseph "his father" (*o pater autou*), honoring the legal lineage and guardianship, while Mary is present as "his mother." Even they, who know the secret of His conception, are found "marveling" (*thaumazontes*). The mystery of the Incarnation is inexhaustible; every new prophetic word adds a layer of wonder to the faithful heart.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
και ηϋ αυτουϲ ϲυ και ειπεν προϲ μαριαμ την αυτου ϊδου ου κειται ειϲ πτω και αναϲταϲ πολλων εν τω και ειϲ ϲημιον αντιλε

**English Translation**
And Sy[meon] ble[ssed] them and said to Mary his [mother]: Behold, [this one] is set for the fa[ll] and rising of many in [Israel] and for a sign spoken again[st].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tone shifts from peace to conflict. Symeon (*Sy*) blesses, but warns. The Child is set (*keitai*) as a stone of stumbling. He brings the "fall" (*pto...*) of the proud and the "rising" (*anastas*) of the humble. He is a *semion* (sign), but a sign of contradiction (*antile...*). The Gospel brings division before it brings ultimate unity; one cannot remain neutral before this Sign.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και ϲου δε αυτηϲ την ψυ διελευϲεται ρομφαια οπωϲ αν αποκαλυφθω εκ πολλων καρδιων διαλογι πονηροι

**English Translation**
And a sword shall go through the so[ul] of you yourself, so that ev[il] thoughts might be revealed from many hearts.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A dark prophecy for the Mother. A *romphaia*—a large, savage sword—shall pierce her soul (*psy...*). This prefigures the Passion, where the mother's grief mirrors the Son's suffering. The purpose of this agony is judgment: that the *dialogi* (thoughts) of many hearts may be laid bare. Uniquely, this manuscript adds *poneroi* (evil), explicitly stating that the thoughts revealed are wicked. The Cross exposes the malice of the world against its Creator.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
και ην αννα προ θυγατηρ φα εκ φυληϲ α κ(αι) αυτη προβεβη εν ημεραιϲ πολ χηρε̣υ̣ϲαϲα ζηϲαϲα μετα ανδροϲ ετη απο τηϲ παρθενι αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And there was Anna, a pro[phetess], daughter of Pha[nuel], from the tribe of A[ser]; and she [was] advanced in ma[ny] days, having been widowed [after] having lived with a husband years [...] from her virgini[ty].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The male witness is joined by the female, Anna the *pro...* (prophetess). She is of Aser (*A*), proving that God has not forgotten the scattered tribes. Her life is a liturgy of time: "advanced in many days," living in widowhood (*chereusasa*) and purity (*partheni*). She represents the persistence of faith through the long silence of history, waiting for the Bridegroom who redeems the time.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
και αυτη χηρα εωϲ ωϲ ετων ε ογδοηκοντα τεϲ η ουκ αφι εκ εκ του ϊερου νηϲτιαϲ νηϲτιαιϲ νηϲτιαιϲ και δεηϲεϲ δεηϲι̣ν̣ λατρευουϲα νυκτα και ημεραν

**English Translation**
And she [was] a widow until as if years eighty-four, who did not depart from from the temple, with fastings, fastings, fastings and supplications, supplication serving night and day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the scribal stuttering upon the text—*heos hos* (until as if) and the threefold repetition of *nestiais* (fastings)—which, though an error of the hand, spiritually underscores the ceaseless intensity of the prophetess's discipline. The number eighty-four represents a fullness of sacred time (seven times twelve), indicating she has consecrated the totality of her life's cycle to the Temple. She serves (*latreuousa*) liturgically, making her very existence a votive offering, never departing from the holy precinct, sustaining the soul while denying the flesh.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και αυτη τη ωρα επιϲτα ανθωμολογι τω και ελα περι αυτου παϲ τοιϲ προϲδεχο λυτρωϲ ι

**English Translation**
And she, at that hour standing by, gave thanks to the [Lord] and spoke concerning him to all those expecting redemption [of] J[erusalem].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the Spirit orchestrates the meeting: "at that hour" she stands by. The text abbreviates the recipient of her praise simply as *to* (the [Lord] or [God]), and the object of hope as *lutros i* (redemption of Jerusalem). This indicates that the faithful remnant, the "expecting ones," understood the code of salvation. Anna does not merely speak; she "confesses in turn" (*anthomologei*), joining her voice to Simeon's, creating a choir of witnesses—male and female, aged and righteous—testifying to the liberation of the Holy City through this infant.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και ωϲ ετελεϲεν ετελεϲαν παντα κατα τον νο επεϲτρεψ υπεϲτρεψ ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν ειϲ την πολιν εαυτων να ˙

**English Translation**
And when he/they had finished all things according to the Law, he/they returned into Galilee, to their own city Naz[areth].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles here, correcting the singular *etelesen* (he finished) to the plural *etelesan* (they finished), rightly affirming that Joseph and Mary together fulfilled the requirements of the *Nomos* (Law). The Incarnate Word submits to the Law He created. Their return is not to a palace, but to *Na*—abbreviated here for Nazareth—emphasizing the humility of the Incarnation. They return to "their own city," grounding the Divine mystery in the mundane geography of Galilee.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
το δε παιδι ηϋξανεν και εκρα πληρου ϲοφιαϲ ϲοφια κ(αι) χαριϲ ην επ αυτο

**English Translation**
But the child grew and was strengthened, being filled with wisdom, wisdom, and grace was upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the refutation of the Docetists: the child truly *euxanen* (grew) and *ekra* (became strong). He did not merely appear as a man but assumed the full reality of human development. The repetition of *sophia* (wisdom) in the manuscript suggests an overflowing; He was being filled continuously in His human capacity with what He possessed eternally in His divine nature. The *Charis* (Grace) of God rests upon Him, marking Him as the Anointed One even in the obscurity of His youth.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
και επορευοντο οι γονιϲ αυτου κατ ε ετοϲ ε τη εορ του παϲχα

**English Translation**
And his parents went every year at the feast of the Passover.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The piety of the *goneis* (parents) is habitual, not sporadic. "According to the year" (*kat etos*) they journey. This establishes the context of the Lord's upbringing: He is raised in strict observance of the covenant. The mention of *Pascha* (Passover) casts a long shadow, for the Boy who travels to celebrate the lamb's sacrifice is Himself the Lamb who will, in this same city, accomplish the true Passover.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και οτε εγενετο ο̣ ετων και αναβαι αυτων κατα το εθοϲ τηϲ εορτηϲ

**English Translation**
And when he became [twelve] years [old], and they were going up according to the custom of the feast.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text preserves a lacuna or numerical shorthand (*o eton*) for his age, yet the tradition holds this as the threshold of maturity. The verb *anabai* (going up) signifies the physical ascent to Jerusalem but also the spiritual ascent to the House of the Father. They follow the *ethos* (custom), showing that true innovation—the New Covenant—emerges from within the faithful keeping of the Old.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
και τελιω ταϲ ημε εν τω ϋποϲτρε αυτουϲ ϋπε ο παιϲ ε ϊερουϲαλημ και ουκ εγνωϲαν οι γονιϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
And having finished the days, in their returning, the boy remained behind in Jerusalem; and his parents did not know [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the verb *hype* (remained behind/persisted). The child does not wander off; He stays with purpose. The parents "did not know" (*ouk egnosan*). This ignorance is not negligence but highlights the mystery: even those closest to the Incarnate Word cannot fully comprehend His divine economy at every moment. He separates Himself from fleshly kin to adhere to His spiritual location—Jerusalem, the place of sacrifice.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
νο δε αυτ ειναι εν τη ϲυνο ηλθον ημεραϲ οδον και ανεζη αυτον εν τοιϲ ϲυγγενεϲιν κ(αι) τοιϲ γνωϲτοιϲ

**English Translation**
But supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey and sought him among the kinsfolk and the acquaintances.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They rely on *nomisantes* (supposing/assumption) rather than sight. They seek Him in the *synodia* (caravan/company) and among *syngenesin* (blood relatives). It is a lesson for the soul: Christ is not always found in the comfort of the crowd or the bonds of blood relation. The "day's journey" away from Jerusalem symbolizes the distance one feels when relying on human assumption rather than divine presence.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
και μη ευροντεϲ ϊϲ εϊϲ ϊερουϲαλημ ζητουντεϲ αναζητουντεϲ αυτ αυτ

**English Translation**
And not finding [him], they returned to Jerusalem seeking, searching diligently for him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe corrects *is* to *eis* (into) and intensifies *zetountes* (seeking) to *anazetountes* (searching up and down/diligently). When the Word is lost to our perception, we must retrace our steps to the Holy City. The repetition of *aut* (him) emphasizes the singularity of their focus. There is no substitute for the Christ; if He is not found among men, one must return to the Temple.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο μετα ημεραϲ τρειϲ ευ αυτον εν τω ϊερω καθεζομε εν μεϲω τ τ διδαϲκαλων κ(αι) ακουοντα αυτ και επηρωτων επερωτωντα επερωτωντα αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And it came to pass after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and hearing them and asking, questioning, questioning them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"After three days"—a prophetic interval prefiguring the Resurrection, where He will be lost to death and found in life. He is *kathezomenon* (sitting), a posture of rest and authority, yet He is "in the midst" of the teachers. The scribal repetition of *eperotonta* (questioning) three times suggests the relentless, piercing nature of His inquiry. He teaches by asking, dismantling the ignorance of the elders through the interrogation of a child.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
εξιϲτ εξιϲτ δε παντεϲ οι ακου αυτου επι τη ϲυνεϲι και ταιϲ αποκριϲεϲιν αυτου

**English Translation**
And all who heard him were amazed, amazed at his understanding and his answers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stutters with *exist exist* (amazed, amazed), visually capturing the dumbfounded reaction of the teachers. They are struck not just by knowledge, but by *synesi* (understanding/synthesis)—the ability to connect the disparate parts of the Law into a coherent divine whole. The Child possesses the key to the Scriptures because He is the Author of them.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδοντεϲ αυτ αυτ εξεπλαγηϲαν και ειπεν προϲ αυτ αυτ η μητηρ αυτου τε τι εποιηϲαϲ η ουτωϲ ϊδου ο πατηρ ϲου καγω οδυνωμενοι ζη εζητουμεν ϲε

**English Translation**
And seeing him, they were struck; and his mother said to him: Child, why have you done this to us? Behold, your father and I, sorrowing, were seeking you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The parents are *exeplagesan* (struck out of their senses). Mary speaks from the depth of human affection and pain (*odynomenoi*—suffering anguish). She names Joseph "your father," a title valid in the legal and nurturing sense, yet one which the Boy is about to gently set aside to reveal His true Sonship. The scribal correction from *ze* to *ezetoumen* (we were seeking) shows the duration of their anxiety. It is the anguish of the soul that loves God but has temporarily lost sight of His presence.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν προϲ αυ τι οτι ζητει εζητειτε με ουκ ηδειτε οτι εν τοιϲ του πα μου δι εινε ειναι με

**English Translation**
And he said to th[em], "Why [is it] that you seek—[or rather] were seeking me? Did you not know that in the [things] of my Fa[ther] it is necess[ary]—to be necessary for me [to be]?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the first utterance of the Incarnate Word recorded in this Codex. The scribe’s hand trembles under the weight of the revelation, stumbling twice: first writing *zetei* (seek) then correcting to *ezeteite* (were seeking), and again struggling with *dei eine* before correcting to *einai* (to be). The boy Jesus establishes the vertical hierarchy of the Cosmos: while Joseph is the guardian on earth, the *Patros mou* (My Father)—marked by the sacred abbreviation—is the eternal progenitor. The word *dei* (it is necessary) binds the Christ to the divine economy; He does not wander; He is fixed in the purpose of the Father.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοι ου ϲυ το ρημα ο ελαληϲεν αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And they did not un[derstand] the saying which he spoke to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is abrupt, the negation *ou sy* hanging in the air, an abbreviation of their lack of comprehension (*synekan*). Even the blessed Virgin and the righteous Joseph stand at the threshold of the mystery, unable to fully grasp the interior life of the God-Man. This ignorance is not a sin but a testament to the transcendence of the Word; the finite mind cannot contain the infinite logic of the Son, even when He stands before them as a child.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
και κατεβη μετ αυ και ηλθεν ειϲ ναζαρετʼ και ην υ αυτοιϲ και η μητηρ αυτου διετηρι π τα ρηματα ταυτα ϲυμβαλλουϲα εν τη καρδια αυτηϲ εαυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And he went down with th[em] and came into Nazareth; and he was su[bject] to them. And his mother kept a[ll] these sayings, pondering [them] in her heart—her own heart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the supreme humility, the *kenosis*. The One who commands the stars is described by the single letter *y* (standing for *hypotassomenos*), meaning He was subject to mortals. The scribe abbreviates *panta* (all) to a mere *pi*, yet the meaning remains full: Mary loses nothing. The text corrects *autes* (her) to *eautes* (her own), emphasizing the deep, interior solitude of the Theotokos. She becomes the living Ark, preserving the *rhemata* (sayings) that the world is not yet ready to receive, digesting the bread of heaven within her soul.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
και ο προεκοπτεν εν τη ϲοφια και η και χαριτι παρα και ανθρωποιϲ

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] advanced in wisdom and a[ge] and grace with [God] and men.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we confront the reality of the flesh against the Docetists. The text says He *proekopten* (advanced/cut his way forward). He did not merely appear wise; He grew in wisdom. The scribe abbreviates *helikia* (stature/age) to *eta*, and strangely omits the Nomina Sacra for God after *para*, skipping straight to "and men." Yet the theology stands firm: The Christ is fully man, subject to time and growth, and fully God, the source of the grace He manifests. He grows in favor, bridging the chasm between the divine silence and human history.
