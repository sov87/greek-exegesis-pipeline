**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
πα δε τινεϲ ε αυτω τω καιρω απαγγελλοντεϲ αυ περι των γαλι ων το αιμα πειλατοϲ εμιξεν μετα των θυϲιων αυτων

**English Translation**
And there were present some at that very time reporting to him concerning the Galileans whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the grim report brought to the Lord: a slaughter within the sacred precinct. Pilate, the governor of the world, mixes human blood with the blood of beasts, a double profanity. The messengers likely expect the Lord to condemn the victims as accursed, for in the common mind, such a gruesome death in the midst of worship suggests a divine rejection of the offerer.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ει αυτοιϲ δοκει οτι οι γαλιλαιοι ου αμαρτωλοι πα πανταϲ τουϲ γα εγενον οτι ταυτα πεπ

**English Translation**
And answering he said to them: Do you think that these Galileans became sinners beyond all the Galileans because they have suffered these things?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord immediately pierces the heart of their error. He questions their logic: "Do you think?" He challenges the assumption that catastrophe is a gauge of iniquity. By asking if these victims were sinners "beyond all," He prepares to level the ground of human pride. Suffering is not a scale upon which we weigh our neighbor's guilt against our own safety.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ουχι λεγω ϋμιν αλλ εαν μη μετανοητε παντεϲ ομοιωϲ απολειϲθε

**English Translation**
No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the thunder of the Gospel. "No," He says, absolving the dead of special guilt, but then He turns the sword upon the living. "Unless you repent"—the verb is plural, addressing the nation. The destruction of the body by Pilate is a shadow of the destruction of the soul that awaits the unrepentant. "Likewise" implies a similarity not necessarily in the mode of death, but in the certainty of ruin.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
η εκεινοι οι δεκα δεκα κ(αι) οκτω εφ ουϲ επε ο πυργοϲ εν τω ϲιλωαμ και απε αυτουϲ δο οτι αυτοι ο εγενοντο παρα πανταϲ τουϲ ανθρωπουϲ τουϲ κατοικουνταϲ ε ϊερουϲαλημ

**English Translation**
Or those eighteen—ten and eight—upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them, do you think that they themselves became debtors beyond all the men dwelling in Jerusalem?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He shifts from the malice of men (Pilate) to the accidents of time (the falling tower). The manuscript stutters on the number ("ten ten"), perhaps trembling at the memory of the tragedy. He calls the victims "debtors" (*opheiletai*), using the language of moral obligation. Yet, He insists: the crushing weight of stone is not a proof of a heavier debt of sin. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are no safer in their righteousness than those crushed at Siloam.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ου λεγω ϋμιν αλλ ε μη μετανοη μετανοητε μετανοηϲητε παντεϲ ωϲ απολειϲθαι

**English Translation**
No, I tell you; but unless you repent [repent, repent], you will all thus perish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency is palpable in the text itself; the scribe writes forms of "repent" (*metanoeite*) multiple times, as if echoing the Lord's repeated cry. The warning is absolute: without a change of mind (*metanoia*), the end is destruction. The "thus" (*hos*) suggests a perishing that is inevitable and total, mirroring the suddenness of the tower's fall.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε ταυτην την παραβολην ϲυ ειχεν τιϲ πε εν τω αν αυτου και ηλθεν ζητων καρπον εν αυτη και ουχ ευρεν

**English Translation**
And he spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The image shifts to the vineyard, the classic symbol of Israel (Isaiah 5). The fig tree, planted (*pephyteumenen*) with care, enjoys the privilege of the vineyard's soil. The owner comes "seeking fruit"—this is the divine expectation. God does not plant us for mere existence, but for the fruit of righteousness. The tragedy here is not a falling tower, but a barren life.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ει δε προϲ τον αμπελουργον ϊ τρια τρια ετη αφ ου ερχομαι ζητων καρπον εν τη ϲυκη ταυτη και ουχ ευρι εκκοψον αυ ϊνατι και την γην καταργει

**English Translation**
And he said to the vinedresser: Behold, three [three] years since I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it also make the land idle?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The owner's patience is measured: "three years." This represents a fullness of time and opportunity. The command "Cut it down" is the verdict of justice. A barren tree is not neutral; it "makes the land idle" (*katargei*), rendering the ground useless and robbing resources from others. Sin is never private; it exhausts the community and the earth itself.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ λε αυτω αφεϲ αυτην και τουτο τοτο το ετοϲ εωϲ ο ϲκαψω περι αυ και βαλω κο

**English Translation**
But answering he says to him: Leave it also this [this] year, until I dig around it and throw manure.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here speaks the Intercessor, the Vinedresser who is Christ. He pleads for time: "Leave it." But this is not a passive mercy; it is an active, painful grace. He will "dig around it"—disturbing the roots, breaking the hardened earth—and apply "manure" (*kopria*), that which is despised, to stimulate life. We are saved through the digging of trials and the humility of dung.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
καν μεν ποι καρπον ειϲ το μελλον ει δε μη γε εκκοψειϲ αυτην

**English Translation**
And if indeed it produces fruit for the future [well]; but if not, you shall cut it down.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sentence hangs in the balance, much like our salvation. "If it produces fruit..."—the outcome is open. "For the future" (*eis to mellon*) points to the eschatological horizon. Yet, the warning remains: "if not, you shall cut it down." Grace extends the time for repentance, but it does not abolish the judgment. The Vinedresser agrees to the axe if the digging fails.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ην δε διδαϲκων εν μια των ϲυνα εν τοιϲ ϲαβ

**English Translation**
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scene is set in the house of instruction (*synagogais*) on the holy day. The Lord honors the Sabbath by teaching, for the true rest is found in the Word of God. This establishes the context for the controversy: is the Sabbath for binding or for loosing?

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου γυ π π εχουϲα αϲθενιαϲ ετη δε και ην ϲ και μη δυναμενη ανα ειϲ το παν

**English Translation**
And behold, a woman having a spirit [spirit] of infirmity [for] years [ten/eighteen?], and was bent together and not able to lift up at all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the tyranny of the devil. The text calls it a "spirit of infirmity," indicating a supernatural affliction. She is "bent together" (*sygkyptousa*), her eyes fixed on the earth, unable to gaze upon the heavens. This is the posture of the sinner, curved inward upon self and dust. "Not able to lift up at all" signifies the total helplessness of humanity under the weight of the Fall.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε αυ ο προϲεφω και ειπ αυτη γυναι απο απο τηϲ αϲθενιαϲ ϲου

**English Translation**
And seeing her, he called to [her] and said to her: Woman, you are loosed [loosed] from your infirmity.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Grace precedes the request. She does not ask; He sees (*idon*). He calls (*prosephonesen*). The declaration is immediate and authoritative: "You are loosed" (*apolelysai*). The repetition of "loosed" (*apo apo*) in the manuscript underscores the completeness of her liberation. The Word of God straightens what the enemy has twisted.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και επεθηκεν αυτη ταϲ χιραϲ και πα ανωρ και εδοξα εδοξαζο̣ν τον

**English Translation**
And he laid upon her the hands; and [immediately] she was straightened, and she glori- was glorifying the...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the efficacy of the Lord’s touch. The text reads *tas chiras* (the hands), the very instruments of creation now applied to restoration. The scribe here stumbles, writing *pa anōr*—a fragment of *parachrēma anōrthōthē*—indicating the suddenness of the miracle; grace does not delay. The woman’s reaction is also captured in a stutter of the pen, *edoxa edoxazon* (glori- was glorifying), as if the magnitude of her praise overwhelmed the writer himself. She glorifies the Creator, though the sentence is cut short at *ton*, leaving the object of her praise (God) understood but unspoken, for who else receives glory when the bent are made straight?

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο αρχϊϲυναγωγοϲ αγανακτων οτι τω ϲαββατω εθε ο ελε τω οχλω οτι εξ ημεραι ειϲιν εν αιϲ δει εργαζεϲθαι εν αυταιϲ ουν ερ θεραπευ θεραπευεϲθαι και μη τη η του ϲαββατου

**English Translation**
But answering, the ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because on the Sabbath he healed... said to the crowd that "Six days there are in which it is necessary to work; in them therefore com- be healed, and not on the day of the Sabbath."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the madness of the legalist. The ruler is *aganaktōn* (indignant) not at sin, but at mercy. He addresses the *ochlō* (crowd), fearing to confront the Physician directly. His argument rests on a mathematical division of time—six days for labor—yet he fails to see that the Sabbath is the day of release from burdens. The text is disjointed (*er therapeu therapeuesthai*), reflecting the ruler's confusion; he commands them to "come be healed" on workdays, reducing the miracle of God to mere human labor (*ergazesthai*). He forbids the loosening of the daughter of Abraham on the very day meant for rest.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη δε αυτω ο και ειπεν ϋπο εκαϲτοϲ ϋ τω ϲαββατω ου λυει τον βουν αυτου η τον ονον απο τηϲ φα και απαγ απαγαγ ποτιζει

**English Translation**
But the [Lord] answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Each of you on the Sabbath, does he not loose his ox or the donkey from the man[ger] and lead- leading away, gives drink?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord strikes at the heart of their pretense, calling them *hypo[kritai]* (hypocrites). He employs the argument from the lesser to the greater. If a beast of burden is worthy of being loosed (*lyei*) from the *pha[tnēs]* (manger) to quench its thirst, how much more a human soul? The scribe’s repetition in *apag apagag* (leading away) emphasizes the labor involved in caring for animals—an act they permit themselves—while they deny the effortless word of God that brings water to the thirsty soul. They value their property above their kin.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ταυτην δε θυγατερα αβρααμ ου ην εδηϲεν ο ϲαταναϲ ϊδου δεκα και οκτω ετη ου εδι λυθηναι απο του δεϲμου τουτου τη ημερα του ϲαβ

**English Translation**
"But this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan bound—behold, ten and eight years—was it not necessary [for her] to be loosed from this bond on the day of the Sab[bath]?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the dignity conferred by Christ: He calls her *thygatera Abraam* (daughter of Abraham), restoring her lineage before the community. The contrast is stark: Satan binds (*edēsen*), but Christ looses (*lythēnai*). The duration, *deka kai oktō etē* (eighteen years), signifies a lifetime of suffering under the Enemy. The Lord uses the word *edei* (it was necessary), implying a divine compulsion of charity that supersedes the ritual restriction. The Sabbath (*sab*) is fulfilled not in idleness, but in the breaking of chains.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και ταυτα λε αυτου κα παν οι αντικειμε αυτω και παϲ ο οχλοϲ εχαιρεν ε παϲιν τοιϲ εν τοιϲ λεγο γεινομενοιϲ ϋπ αυτου

**English Translation**
And [as] he [was] say[ing] these things, all those opposing him were asha[med]; and all the crowd was rejoicing over all the [things] spo[ken]/happening by him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The power of Truth acts as a two-edged sword: it brings shame (*ka[tēschynonto]*) to the adversaries (*antikeime[nois]*) and joy (*echairen*) to the simple crowd. The text here is difficult, reading *lego yeinomenois* (spoken/happening) where we might expect "glorious things." Yet, even in this reading, the people rejoice in the *logos* becoming deed. The humiliation of the proud leaders is public; they are silenced not by force, but by the undeniable manifestation of divine power which the common people instinctively recognize and celebrate.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν ουν τινι ομοια εϲτιν η βα του και τι ομοιωϲω αυ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore he was saying: "To what is the King[dom] of [God] like? And to what shall I liken it?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord turns from controversy to instruction. He asks *tini homoia* (to what is it like?), searching for an image to convey the mystery of the *ba[sileia]* (Kingdom). This double questioning reveals the difficulty of expressing heavenly realities in earthly terms. He invites the listener to contemplate the nature of God’s reign, which does not come with the observation of the pharisees, but in hidden, organic growth.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ομοια εϲτ κοκκω ϲιναπε ον λαβων αν ειϲβαλ εβαλ ειϲ τον κηπον αυτου και ηϋξηϲεν και εγενετο ειϲ δεν και τα πετινα του ουρανου κατε εν τοιϲ κλαδοιϲ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
"It is like a grain of mustard, which a m[an] taking, c- cast into his garden; and it grew and became a tr[ee], and the birds of heaven dwel[led] in its branches."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Kingdom begins in insignificance, like the *kokkō sinape[ōs]* (grain of mustard). The scribe stutters at *eisbal ebal* (cast/threw), emphasizing the act of sowing into the *kēpon* (garden)—perhaps the world, or the soil of the heart. From this smallness arises a great structure, a *den[dron]* (tree). The *petina* (birds) represent the nations or the soaring souls finding rest (*kate[skēnōsen]*) within the shelter of the Church. The growth is divine, transforming the smallest seed into a cosmic shelter.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και παλιν ειπεν τινι ομοιωϲω την βα του

**English Translation**
And again he said: "To what shall I liken the King[dom] of [God]?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Palin* (again) He speaks. The repetition confirms the importance of the teaching. The Kingdom is not one-dimensional; it requires multiple similitudes to be grasped. He persists in asking *tini homoiōsō* (to what shall I liken), showing his desire to make the mysteries of the *ba[sileia]* accessible to the humble mind.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ο εϲτιν ζυμη ην λαβουϲα γυνη ενεκρυψεν ειϲ α ϲατα τρια ε ου εζυμωθη ο

**English Translation**
"It is [like] leaven, which a woman taking hid in three meas[ures] of fl[our], un[til] the wh[ole] was leavened."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the image shifts from external growth (the tree) to internal transformation. The *zymē* (leaven) is the Gospel, hidden (*enekrypsen*) within the nature of humanity. The *tria sata* (three measures) may signify the whole world, or the tripartite nature of man (body, soul, spirit). The process is secret but total, continuing *he[ōs]* (until) the *ho[lon]* (whole) is leavened. As the leaven changes the flour, so grace changes the sinner, not by destroying nature, but by perfecting it from within.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και διεπορευ κατα πολιϲ και κωμαϲ διδαϲκ και ποριαν ποιου ειϲ ϊεροϲο

**English Translation**
And he was passing through by cit[ies] and villages, teach[ing] and mak[ing] a journey toward Jerusa[lem].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Shepherd is always in motion, *dieporeu[eto]* (passing through). He visits both *polis* (cities) and *kōmas* (villages), showing no partiality to the great or small. His activity is twofold: *didask[ōn]* (teaching) and *porian poiou[menos]* (making a journey). The destination is fixed: *Ieroso[lyma]* (Jerusalem). He teaches as one walking toward his own sacrifice. The instruction is the viaticum for the journey of the Cross.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε τιϲ αυ ει ολιγοι οι ϲω ο δε ειπεν προϲ αυ

**English Translation**
And a certain one said to hi[m], "Are those be[ing] sa[ved] few?" But he said to the[m]:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Curiosity prompts the question: *ei oligoi* (are they few?). The inquirer treats salvation (*sō[zomenoi]*) as a matter of statistics rather than a personal struggle. The participle is present—"those being saved"—indicating a process, not a static state. The Lord does not answer the "how many," but turns to the crowd (*pros au[tous]*), addressing the "how" of salvation. He redirects the mind from speculation to necessary action.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
αγωνιζεϲθαι ειϲελθιν δια τηϲ ϲτενηϲ θυραϲ οτι πολλοι λεγω ϋμ ϋμ ζητηϲουϲιν ειϲελ και ουκ ιϲχυ

**English Translation**
"Struggle to enter through the narrow door; because many, I say to y- you, will seek to ent[er] and will not have str[ength]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is martial: *agōnizesthai* (struggle/agonize). Salvation is not for the passive; it requires the exertion of an athlete. The door is *stenēs* (narrow), stripping away the baggage of wealth and pride. The warning is dire: *polloi* (many) will seek but will fail. Why? Because they *ouk ischy[sousin]* (will not have strength/be able). They lack the strength because they rely on themselves or seek to enter too late. The scribe repeats *hymin* (to you) twice, emphasizing the personal urgency of the warning.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
αφ ου αν ε ο οικοδεϲπο και αποκλιϲη την θυραν και αρξη εξω εϲταναι κ(αι) εξω εϲταναι κ(αι) κρουειν την θυραν λεγοντεϲ ανοιξον ημιν και αποκριθειϲ ε ϋμιν ουκ οιδα ϋμαϲ ποθεν εϲτε

**English Translation**
From [the time] when the house-master rises and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and to stand outside and to knock [at] the door saying, 'Open to us,' and answering he says to you, 'I do not know you from where you are.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrifying finality in the scribe’s hand. The text reads *exō estanai* (to stand outside) twice; a duplication that is not merely an error of the pen, but a spiritual emphasis on the duration and hopelessness of the exclusion. Once the *oikodespotēs* (house-master) has risen—indicated by the abbreviated *e* [egerthe]—the opportunity for entrance ceases. The door is not merely closed but shut fast (*apoklisē*). The plea "Open to us" is met with a denial of origin: He knows not from "where" they are, for their origin is not of the Spirit, but of the earth.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
τοτε αρξηϲθαι λεγε λεγε εφαγομεν ενω ϲου και επι και εν ταιϲ πλατιαιϲ ημων εδιδαξαϲ

**English Translation**
Then you will begin to say, to say, 'We ate before you and [drank/upon?] and in our broad streets you taught.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the damned is captured in the stuttering repetition *lege lege* (to say, to say). They appeal to proximity, claiming they ate in His presence. The text here is fractured; we see *kai epi* (and upon/and [drank]), where the word for "drank" (*epion*) seems curtailed or lost, perhaps indicating the emptiness of their claim—they ate, but did not truly drink of the Living Water. They cite His teaching in their *platiais* (broad streets), yet they remained in the breadth of the way that leads to destruction, rather than the narrow gate previously commanded.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και ερει ϋμιν ουκ οιδα ϋμαϲ ποθεν εϲτε απο απ εμου π εργαται αδικιαϲ

**English Translation**
And he will say to you, 'I do not know you from where you are; depart, depart from me, all workers of unrighteousness.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rejection is absolute. The command *apo* (depart) is written, then immediately repeated as *ap emou* (depart from me), reinforcing the severance. The Codex abbreviates "all" (*pantes*) to a single *p*, as if the multitude of the wicked is so vast it requires shorthand. They are branded *ergatai adikias* (workers of unrighteousness); though they claimed to eat with Him, their labor was for iniquity. Familiarity with the Bishop or the altar does not save if the hands are busy with unjust works.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
εκει εϲτε ο κλαυθ και ο βρυγμοϲ των οδοντων ο ϊδητε αβρααμ και ϊϲακ ϊϲαακ · και ϊακωβ και πανταϲ τουϲ προφηταϲ εν τη βαϲιλεια του ϋ δε εκβαλλομε εξω

**English Translation**
There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you being cast outside.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the torment of sight: to see the Patriarchs within while one is without. The scribe writes *Isak Isaak*, naming the son of Promise twice, perhaps correcting the spelling, or perhaps emphasizing that the lineage of promise is sure. The Kingdom belongs to the *Theou* (God, abbreviated *U*), and the exclusion is active: *ekballomenous* (being cast out). It is a continuous state of expulsion amidst the gnashing of teeth, a physical manifestation of spiritual regret.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και ηξου απο ανατολ και δυϲμων και βορρα και νοτου και ανακλιθηϲον εν τη βαϲιλει του

**English Translation**
And they will come from east and west and north and south and will recline in the kingdom of God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The catholicity of the Church is foretold. They shall come (*hēxousin*) from all four winds—*anatolōn* (risings/east), *dysmōn* (settings/west), *borra* (north), and *notou* (south). The verb *anaklithēsontai* (they will recline) speaks of the messianic banquet. Note that the text does not say they will stand or serve, but recline as sons and heirs. This universal ingathering stands in stark judgment against those "sons of the kingdom" who were cast out in the previous verse.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ει εϲχατοι οι εϲ εϲ πρωτοι και ει πρωτοι οι εϲ εϲ εϲχατοι ·

**English Translation**
And behold, there are last ones who will be, will be first, and there are first ones who will be, will be last.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Great Reversal. The scribe struggles with the future tense, writing *es es* (will be, will be) repeatedly, as if stammering over the mystery of divine election. Those who seem *eschatoi* (last) in the eyes of the world—or even the catechumens standing at the back of the nave—may be destined for the highest seats. Conversely, the *prōtoi* (first), those holding rank and dignity, may find themselves at the end. Humility is the only safe harbor in this fluidity of status.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
εν αυ τη ωρα προϲηλ τινεϲ φαριϲαι λεγοντεϲ αυ εξελθε και πο εντευθεν οτι ηρωδηϲ θελει ϲε αποκτειναι

**English Translation**
In that very hour some Pharisees approached saying to him, 'Go out and go from here, because Herod wants to kill you.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisees, often adversaries, here appear as messengers of warning, though their motives remain opaque. They urge Him to *poreuou* (go/depart). The threat is political: Herod, the tetrarch, desires to kill (*apokteinai*) the Lord. It is a collision of earthly power and Divine mission. The Lord is warned to flee for His life, but as the subsequent verses show, He moves only according to the divine timetable, not the threats of foxes.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ πορευθεντεϲ ει τη αλωπεκι ταυτη εκβαλ δαιμονια και ϊαϲειϲ αποτελω ϲημερον και αυρι και τη τριτη τε

**English Translation**
And he said to them, 'Having gone, say to this fox, [Behold] I cast out demons and I perform cures today and tomorrow, and on the third [day] I finish.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He names the tetrarch *alōpeki* (a fox), a beast of cunning and low earth. The Lord asserts His authority over the spiritual realm (*ekballō daimonia*) regardless of Herod's intent. The timeline is mystical: *sēmeron* (today), *aurion* (tomorrow), and *tē tritē* (the third). This is not merely a travel itinerary but a prophecy of the Passion and Resurrection. On the third day, *teleioumai* (I am perfected/finished). He does not flee death; He marches toward its conquest.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
πλην δει με ϲημερον και αυριον κ(αι) τη ερχομενη πορευ οτι ουκ ενδε ειϲ̣τ̣εχεται προφητην απολεϲθαι εξω ϊε ·

**English Translation**
However, it is necessary for me today and tomorrow and the coming [day] to go, because it is not admissible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word *dei* (it is necessary) governs the Christ's life. He is bound by the divine economy, not by Herod. The text presents a difficult reading *eistechetai* (likely for *endechetai* - is admissible/possible). The irony is biting: Jerusalem, the Holy City (*Ierousalem* abbreviated to *Ie*), has the monopoly on killing God's messengers. It is the designated slaughterhouse for the prophets. He cannot die in Galilee; the sacrifice must be offered at the altar of the rebellious capital.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ϊερου ϊερουϲαλημ η αποκτεινουϲα τουϲ προφηταϲ και λιθοβολουϲα τουϲ απεϲταλμενουϲ προϲ αυτον αυτην ποϲα ηθεληϲα επιϲυ τα τεκνα ϲου ον τροπον ορνιξ την εαυτου εαυτηϲ νοϲϲι ϋπο ταϲ πτερυ και ουκ ηθελη

**English Translation**
Jeru- Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets and stoning those sent to her! How often I wanted to gather together your children, in the manner a bird [gathers] her own brood under the wings, and you did not want [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stutters in horror or reverence: *Ierou Ierousalem*. The city is personified as a murderess, stoning those sent to her. Against this violence, the Lord offers the tenderness of an *ornix*—a dialect form for a bird or hen found in this Codex—gathering her *nossia* (brood/nestlings). The tragedy of the will is laid bare: *ēthelēsa* (I wanted) versus *ouk ēthelēsate* (you did not want). The divine will for salvation is thwarted by the stubborn human refusal to be gathered under the wings of the Shekinah.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ϊδου αφιεται ϋμιν ο οικοϲ ϋμ λεγω δε ϋμιν ου μη ϊδητε με εωϲ αν ει ευλογημενοϲ ο ερχομενοϲ εν ο

**English Translation**
Behold, your house is left to you. But I say to you, you will certainly not see me until you say, 'Blessed is the one coming in [the] N[ame].'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment falls: *aphietai* (is left/abandoned). The Temple is no longer God's house, but "your house" (*oikos hymōn*). The Divine Presence departs. The Codex ends the verse abruptly with *en o*—standing for *en onomati Kuriou* (in the name of the Lord). This truncation signifies that until they can speak the Name in truth, they remain in blindness. The vision of Christ is withheld until the confession of faith is made.
