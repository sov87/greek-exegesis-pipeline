**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε παραβο αυτοιϲ προϲ το δειν παντοτε προϲευχεϲθαι αυ αυτουϲ και μη ενκα

**English Translation**
And he was telling a parable to them regarding the [necessity] always to pray [for] them and not to [lose heart]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the urgency in the Lord’s instruction. The text reads *pros to dein* (regarding the necessity); prayer is not a luxury for the soul, but a requirement for survival. The scribe stumbles over *autous* (them), repeating the syllable *au*, perhaps trembling at the command. The final word is cut short—*enka*—surely *enkakein* (to faint or lose heart). We must pray constantly precisely because the alternative is a collapse of the spirit.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
λεγων κρι τιϲ ην εν τινι πολει τον μη φοβουμενοϲ και ανθρωπον μη εν

**English Translation**
...saying, "A certain judge was in a certain city, not fearing God and not [regarding] man..."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the portrait of absolute lawlessness clothed in authority. The scribe abbreviates *krites* (judge) to *kri*, and God to the sacred *ThN*. This judge is defined by two negatives: he has no vertical fear of the Divine (*ThN*) and no horizontal shame before humanity (*anthropon*). When the fear of God is absent, respect for man inevitably vanishes. He is a judge who judges only for himself.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
χη δε ην εν τη πο εκινη και ηρ προϲ αυτον λεγουϲα εκδικη με απο του μου

**English Translation**
And a widow was in that city, and she [was coming] to him saying, "Vindicate me from the [adversary] of me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *chera* (widow) stands as the archetype of the defenseless. The text says she *er* (was coming)—implying a continuous, repeated action. Her cry is for *ekdikesin*—justice, vindication. The text is stark: *apo tou mou* (from the [one] of me). The adversary is unnamed in this fragment, for the adversary is secondary; the focus is on the persistence of her plea against the silence of the powerful.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και ουκ ηθελεν επι χρονον μετα δε μετα δε ταυτα ειπεν εν ε ει και τον ου φοβουμαι ου ανθρωπον εν

**English Translation**
And he did not want to for a time; but after, but after these things he said in [himself], "If even God I do not fear, nor man do I [regard]..."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex reveals the judge's hesitation through the scribal repetition *meta de meta de* (but after, but after). It signifies the passage of time where grace was rejected. He speaks *en e* (in himself)—the council of the wicked is always internal. He confesses his own atheism: "If even God (*ThN*) I do not fear." He glories in his hardness of heart, confirming his separation from the communion of saints.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
δια γε το παρενοχλειν παρεειν παρεχειν μοι κοπουϲ κοπον την χη ταυτην εκδι αυτην μη ειϲ τελοϲ ερχο ϋπωπια με

**English Translation**
...yet because of the bothering—[correction: providing] me trouble—this widow, I will vindicate her, lest coming to the end she [bruise] me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is chaotic, reflecting the judge's agitation. The scribe writes *parechein* (to provide) over *pareein*, and corrects *kopous* (troubles) to *kopon* (trouble). The judge acts not out of mercy, but to avoid annoyance. The word *hypopia* refers to a blow under the eye; he fears that her unceasing prayer will metaphorically beat him black and blue. Persistence wears down even the stone heart.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ο ακουϲατε τι ο κριτηϲ τηϲ αδικι λεγει

**English Translation**
And the [Lord] said, "Hear what the judge of unrighteousness says."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord (*KS* implied) commands us to listen. The title is terrifying: *o krites tes adiki* (the judge of unrighteousness). If an unjust man yields to pressure to save his own comfort, how much more will the Righteous One act? The argument is from the lesser to the greater, from the wicked to the Holy.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ου μη ποιηϲη την εκδικηϲιν των εκλεκτων αυτου των βοωντων αυτω ημεραϲ και νυκτοϲ και μακρο επ αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
But [God], will He not surely do the vindication of His elect, those crying to Him day and night, and [is He] longsuffering over them?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the assurance. The *eklekton* (elect) are identified by their action: *boonton* (crying out) day and night. The text asks if God is *makro* (longsuffering) over them. This is a mystery: does He delay to test their faith, or is His patience a holding back of wrath against their oppressors? In the silence of God, the elect must continue to cry out.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λεγω ϋμιν οτι ποιηϲει την εκ αυτων ταχει πλην ο του ανθρωπου ελθ αρα ευρηϲει την πιϲτιν επι τηϲ γηϲ

**English Translation**
I say to you that He will do the [vindication] of them quickly. Nevertheless, the [Son] of Man [coming], will He then find the faith on the earth?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A chilling interrogation. Vindication (*ek* for *ekdikesin*) will come *tachei* (quickly), but the question remains regarding us. When the Son of Man comes (*elth*), will He find *ten pistin*—not just general belief, but *the* specific faith of the persistent widow? The scarcity of such faith is implied. We must strive to be found faithful amidst the delay.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε και προϲ τι τουϲ πεποιθο εφ εαυτοιϲ ο ειϲιν δικαιοι και εξουδενουν τουϲ λοιπουϲ την παραβολην ταυ ·

**English Translation**
And He said also to certain ones, those having trusted in themselves that they are righteous and despising the rest, this parable...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The target shifts. The spiritual disease identified here is *pepoithotas eph eautois* (having trusted in themselves). Self-trust is the mother of pride. The consequence of this self-righteousness is *exoudenoun* (treating as nothing) "the rest." To elevate oneself is inevitably to trample upon the brother.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ανθρωποι δυ ανεβηϲαν ειϲ το ϊερον προϲευξα ο ειϲ φαριϲαιοϲ και ο ετεροϲ τε

**English Translation**
Two men went up into the temple to [pray]; the one a Pharisee and the other a [tax collector].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Two men ascend, but their destinations are worlds apart. The scribe abbreviates *proseuxasthai* (to pray) and *telones* (tax collector) to *te*. The Pharisee represents the height of religious form; the *te* represents the depth of social exclusion. They stand in the same holy space (*ieron*), yet one stands in pride, the other in need.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ο φαριϲαι ϲταθειϲ ταυτα προϲ εαυτον προϲηϋχετο ο ευχαριϲτω ϲοι ο ουκ ειμι ωϲπερ οι λοιποι των ανθρωπων αρπα αδικοι μοιχοι η και ωϲ ουτοϲ ο τελωνηϲ

**English Translation**
The Pharisee, standing, was praying these things to himself: "O [God], I thank You [that] I am not as the rest of men—[swindlers], unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the text: *pros eauton* (to himself). He prays not to God, but to his own reflection. His thanksgiving is a catalogue of others' sins. He defines his holiness by separation: "not as the rest." He lists *arpages* (swindlers), *adikoi* (unrighteous), and points a finger at "this tax collector." This is not prayer; it is a soliloquy of damnation disguised as piety.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
νηϲτευ διϲ του ϲαββατου αποδεκατευω αποδεκατω π οϲα κτωμαι

**English Translation**
"I fast twice in the Sabbath; I tithe [all] as much as I acquire."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He lists his credentials. The Law required one fast; he offers two. The scribe stumbles, writing *apodekateuo apodekato* (I tithe, I tithe), emphasizing the mechanical repetition of his works. He trusts in *osa ktomai* (as much as I acquire). He believes he can buy God's favor with the currency of his own discipline. He is full of himself, leaving no room for grace.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε τελωνηϲ μα εϲτωϲ ου ηθελεν ουδε τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ επα ειϲ τον ουραν αλλʼ ετυπτε το ϲτη αυτου λεγων ο μοι τω αμαρτωλω ˙

**English Translation**
But the tax-collector standing [far off] did not wish even to lift the eyes to the heaven, but was striking his [breast], saying: God, [be merciful] to me the sinner.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the geography of repentance. The Pharisee stands near, yet is far from grace; the tax-collector stands *makrothen* (far off), yet draws near to mercy. He strikes the *stēthos* (breast), the very seat of the heart and conscience, punishing the vessel of his hidden thoughts. He dares not look at the *ouranon* (heaven), for he knows his deeds belong to the earth, yet his cry is directed solely to the Divine. He offers no defense, only his identity as "the sinner," acknowledging that without the propitiation of *Theos*, he is lost.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
λεγω ϋμιν κατεβη ουτοϲ δεδικαιω ειϲ τον οι αυτου παρ ε οτι παϲ ο ϋψων εαυτον ταπινωθηϲεται ὁ δε ταπινων ε ϋψωθηϲε̣ ˙

**English Translation**
I say to you, this one went down justified to his house rather than [that one]; because everyone exalting himself shall be humbled, but the one humbling [himself] shall be exalted.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the divine paradox of the Kingdom: ascent requires descent. The tax-collector returns to his *oikon* (house) bearing the justification of God, not because of what he did, but because of what he confessed he could not do. The Pharisee, full of self, returns empty of grace. The scribe records *dedikaiōmenos* (justified)—a forensic act of God where the humble are acquitted and the proud are left to the judgment of their own insufficient works. Pride is a thief that steals glory; humility is the treasurer that receives it.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
προϲεφερον δε αυτω και τα βρεφη ϊνα αυτων απτη ˙ ϊδοντεϲ δε οι μα επετιμ αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
Now they were bringing to him also the infants that he might touch them; but seeing [it], the disciples were rebuking them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *brephē* (infants) represent humanity in its most helpless state—unable to walk, they must be carried. They seek only the *haptē* (touch) of the Incarnate Word, for His touch communicates life. The disciples (*mathētai*), acting as gatekeepers of a dignity they do not understand, rebuke the bringers. They mistake the Lord’s holiness for withdrawal, not realizing that True Holiness burns to consume the separation between the Creator and the smallest of His creatures.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε προϲ αυτα λεγων αφετε τα παιδια ερχεϲθαι προϲ με και μη κωλυετε αυτα τ γαρ τοιουτων ε η βαϲιλεια του ˙

**English Translation**
But He, [calling] them to [himself], saying: Permit the little children to come to me and do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord issues a command of release: *aphete* (permit/let go). He calls the children *pros* (to) Himself, bridging the gap the disciples tried to enforce. The Kingdom belongs to "such as these"—not because of their innocence, for all are born in Adam, but because of their disposition of trust. A child possesses nothing and receives everything; this is the only posture capable of holding the weight of the Kingdom of *Theos*. To hinder the simple is to oppose the very nature of grace.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν οϲ αν μη δεξηται την βαϲιλιαν του ωϲ παιδιον ου μη ειϲελθη ειϲ αυ ˙

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of [God] as a little child, shall by no means enter into [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "Amen" seals this truth as absolute. The Kingdom is not a prize to be seized by the strong, but a gift to be received (*dexētai*) by the weak. The comparison *hōs paidion* (as a little child) destroys intellectual pride. The double negative *ou mē* (by no means) emphasizes the impossibility of entrance through merit. We do not climb up to God; we allow Him to lift us up. The gate is low; only those who crawl may pass.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και επηρω τιϲ αυτον αρχων λεγων ˙ διδαϲκαλε αγαθε τι ποιηϲαϲ ζω αιωνιον κληρο ˙

**English Translation**
And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal [life]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *archōn* (ruler) approaches with the mindset of a merchant. He addresses Jesus as "Good Teacher," a flattery intended to smooth the way for a transaction. His question reveals his error: *ti poiēsas* (having done what). He believes eternal *zōēn* (life) is a wage earned by labor, or an inheritance (*klēronomēsō*) secured by legal observance. He seeks a task to perform, not a Savior to trust.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτω ο τι με λεγειϲ αγαθον ουδιϲ αγαθοϲ ει μη ειϲ ο ·

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] said to him: Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord halts the man's flattery to expose the theological reality. If Jesus is merely a "Teacher," He is not the source of absolute Goodness. If He is "Good" in the absolute sense, He is *Theos*. Jesus does not deny His own goodness but challenges the ruler's definition of it. He points the man away from human measuring sticks to the One Source—*Theos*. Before one can inherit life, one must know who God is.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ταϲ εν οιδαϲ ˙ μη μοιχευϲηϲ μη φονευϲηϲ μη κλεψηϲ μη ψευδομαρτυρηϲηϲ τιμα τον πατερα ϲου και την μητερα ϲου

**English Translation**
You know the [commandments]: Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and your mother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Jesus cites the *entolas* (commandments) from the second table of the Law, regarding the neighbor. He lists the prohibitions against external acts—adultery, murder, theft, lying—and the positive command to honor parents. He is holding up the mirror of the Law. He omits the command against covetousness here, perhaps to see if the ruler's conscience is awake enough to notice the internal lack that the external law cannot fill.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ταυτα π εφυλαξα εκ νεο μου ˙

**English Translation**
And he said: All these things I guarded from my [youth].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A tragic confession of spiritual blindness. The ruler claims to have *ephylaxa* (guarded/kept) the whole Law from his *neotētos* (youth). He sees the Law as a perimeter to be defended, and he believes he has succeeded. Yet, if he were truly full, he would not be asking for life. His confidence in his own righteousness is the very barrier preventing him from receiving the righteousness of God.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ο ειπεν αυτω οτι ετι εν ϲοι λιπει π οϲα εχιϲ πωλη και δοϲ πτω και εξειϲ θη εν ουρανοιϲ και δευρο ακολου μοι ˙

**English Translation**
Now having heard, [Jesus] said to him: Yet one thing is lacking for you; sell [all] as much as you have, and give to the [poor], and you will have [treasure] in the heavens; and come, follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Great Physician locates the hidden tumor: *en soi leipei* (one thing is lacking in you). The man kept the commandments, but his possessions kept him. The command is radical: *pōlēson* (sell) and *dos* (give). This is not just charity; it is the destruction of his idol. The promise is *thēsauron* (treasure) in the heavens, but the condition is the abandonment of earthly security to *akolouthei* (follow) the Living Word. He cannot hold the hand of Jesus while clutching his gold.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ακουϲαϲ ταυτα παντα πε εγενηθη ην γαρ πλουϲιοϲ ϲφοδρα

**English Translation**
But he, having heard these things, became [very sorrowful]; for he was rich exceedingly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cost of the Kingdom is revealed, and the price is too high for the merchant of works. He becomes *perilupos* (very sorrowful). The text notes he was rich *sphodra* (exceedingly). His abundance became his cage. The sorrow indicates a divided heart—he desired life, but he loved his chains more. He walks away, the poorest man in the narrative, for he retains his dust but loses the Pearl.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε αυτον ο ειπεν πωϲ δυϲκο οι τα χρημα εχοντεϲ ειϲ τ βαϲιλειαν του ειϲελευϲονται ˙

**English Translation**
And seeing him, [Jesus] said: How [with difficulty] those having [riches] shall enter into the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Jesus looks upon the retreating soul with truth and pity. He declares the *dyskolōs* (difficulty/hardship) of the wealthy. It is not the *chrēmata* (riches) themselves that are evil, but the "having" of them—the possession that possesses the possessor. The Kingdom is a narrow gate; those swollen with the pride of ownership cannot fit through. To enter, one must become like the beggar, having nothing but God.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ευκοπωτερον γαρ εϲτιν καμηλ δια τρηματοϲ βε ειϲελθειν η πλουϲιον ειϲ τ βαϲιλειαν του ειϲελθειν

**English Translation**
For it is easier [for a] camel to enter through [the] perforation of [a] needle than [for a] rich [man] to enter into the kingdom of the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal compression in *kamel* (camel) and *be* (needle); the text itself contracts, just as the rich man must contract his swelling pride to pass the narrow gate. The word *trematos* denotes a perforation or a bored hole, a violent opening in solid matter. The camel, a beast of burden and storage, represents the soul laden with the water of this life and the humps of accumulated wealth. The scribe leaves the divine name at the end simply as *tou* (of the), implying the *Theou* (God); the Kingdom belongs to the One who is so holy that His name is silenced, while the rich man clatters against the gate with his possessions.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ειπαν δε οι ακου και τιϲ δυ ϲωθηναι ˙

**English Translation**
And those hearing said, "And who is able to be saved?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates *akou* (hearing) and *du* (able). The listeners are cut short in their understanding. The question "Who is able?" (*tis du*) hangs in the air, a fragment of despair. They perceive the salvation of the wealthy as an impossibility of physics, not yet understanding the physics of Grace. The abruptness of the Greek reflects the sudden terror of the congregation realizing that human merit is insufficient for the ascent.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ειπεν τα αδυ παρα ανθρω δυνατα παρα τω εϲτιν ˙

**English Translation**
But he said, "The things impossible with men are possible with the [God]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the resolution to the previous despair. The *adu* (impossible things) of *anthro* (men) stand in direct opposition to the power *para to* (with the [God]). The scribe omits the divine noun *Theo*, leaving only the article *to*, pointing toward the Divine Essence without limiting it. Man is defined by what he cannot do (*adunata*); God is defined by the fact that existence itself bends to His will. Where the needle's eye is impassable to nature, it becomes a wide gate to Grace.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ὁ πετροϲ ϊδου ημιϲ αφηκα παντα και αφεντεϲ τα ϊδια η ϲοι τι αρα εϲται ημιν

**English Translation**
And Peter said, "Behold, we left all things and leaving our own [things] ?followed? thee; what then will be for us?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter speaks for the apostolic band, asserting *apheka panta* (we left all). The text here presents a reading that echoes the transactional anxiety found in other Gospels ("what then will be for us?"). Peter emphasizes *ta idia* (one's own private things)—they have abandoned the sphere of private ownership for the commonality of Christ. Yet, the question betrays a lingering attachment to reward; he has left the goods of the world but not the desire for the wages of the world.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ αμην λεγω ϋμ οτι ουδειϲ εϲτιν οϲ αφηκεν οικιαν η γυναικα η αδελ η γονιϲ η τε εινεκεν τηϲ βαϲιλειαϲ του

**English Translation**
And he said to them, "Amen I say to you that there is no one who left house or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of the [God]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord lists the bonds of flesh: *oikian* (house), *gunaika* (wife), *adel* (brothers), *gonis* (parents), *te* (children). These are the ligaments of earthly society. To leave them is a kind of social death, a martyrdom of the heart. The scribe curtails *adelphous* and *tekna*, as if the very writing of these relations is shortened by the urgency of the Kingdom. The motive must be pure: *eineken tes basileias* (on account of the Kingdom). It is not abandonment for the sake of solitude, but for the sake of Sovereignty.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
οϲ ουχι μη απο πολλαπλα εν τω και τουτω και εν τω αιωνι τω ερχο ζωην αιω

**English Translation**
Who does not receive manifold in this time, and in the age coming life eternal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise is twofold. First, *pollapla* (manifold) in *to kai touto* (this time)—a restoration of spiritual family within the Church, where every believer becomes brother, sister, and mother. Second, in the *aioni to ercho* (the age coming), *zoen aio* (life eternal). The abbreviation of *aionion* to *aio* suggests that the eternal life is infinite, unable to be fully contained in letters. The temporal reward supports the journey; the eternal reward is the destination.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
παραλαβων δε τουϲ δωδεκα ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ ϊδου ανα ειϲ ϊε και τε παν τα γεγραμμενα δια των προφη τω ϋϊω του

**English Translation**
And taking the twelve he said to them, "Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things written through the prophets will be accomplished for the Son of the [Man?]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ascent to *Ie* (Jerusalem) is the prelude to the Passion. The Lord gathers the Twelve in intimacy to reveal the *tele* (consummation) of scripture. All history, written *dia ton prophe* (through the prophets), converges on this moment. The text ends with *to uio tou* (the Son of the...), leaving the genitive hanging. Is He the Son of Man? The Son of God? He is the Son of the Mystery. The silence at the end of the verse mirrors the silence of the grave He approaches.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
παραδοθηϲεται γαρ τοιϲ εθνεϲιν και εμπεχθηϲε και ϋβριϲθηϲε και εμπτυϲθη

**English Translation**
For he will be betrayed to the nations and will be mocked and will be insulted and will be spit upon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the degradation of the Logos. He is given over to the *ethnesin* (Gentiles/nations), moving from the sacred enclosure of Israel to the chaotic world of the idolaters. The verbs pile up in passive suffering: *empechthese* (mocked), *ubristhese* (insulted), *emptusthe* (spit upon). The spittle of men defiles the face that molded man from clay. This is the *kenosis*, the self-emptying, written in the stark, abbreviated ink of the codex.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και μαϲτιγω αποκτε αυτον και τη ημερα τη τριτη αναϲτηϲεται ˙

**English Translation**
And having scourged [him] they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The violence intensifies to *mastigo* (scourging) and *apokte* (killing). The Author of Life submits to death. Yet, the verse does not end in the tomb. *Te hemera te trite* (the third day) stands as the boundary of death's dominion. *Anastesetai* (he will rise)—the verb is active. Men kill; God rises. The punctuation mark at the end signifies a pause, a breath taken before the incomprehension of the disciples is revealed.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοι ουδεν του ϲυνηκαν και ην το ρημα τουτο κεκρυμμενον α αυτων και ουκ ε τα λεγο ˙

**English Translation**
And they understood nothing of these things, and this word was hidden from them, and they did not know the things said.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A triple negation of the mind: *ouden sunekan* (understood nothing), *kekrummenon* (hidden), *ouk e* (did not know). The mystery of the Cross is so alien to human expectation of a conquering Messiah that the words, though plain, are veiled. The *rhema* (utterance) is hidden not by esoteric encryption, but by the hardness of their hearts which crave glory without suffering. They hear the sound, but miss the Word.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν τω εγγιζειν αυτον ειϲ ϊεριχω τυφλοϲ τιϲ εκαθητο παρα την οδον επαιτ

**English Translation**
And it happened in his drawing near to Jericho a certain blind man sat by the way begging.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As they approach Jericho, the city of the curse, we encounter a *tuphlos* (blind man). He sits *para ten odon* (by the way), marginalized. While the disciples are spiritually blind to the coming Passion (Verse 34), this man is physically blind but perhaps spiritually alert. He is *epait* (begging), a posture of dependence that the rich ruler of Verse 25 could not master. He waits in darkness for the Light of the World to pass.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε οχλου διαπορευομενου επυνθανετο τι ει τουτο ˙

**English Translation**
And hearing a crowd passing through he inquired what this might be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Deprived of sight, the blind man relies on *akousas* (hearing). Faith comes by hearing. He senses the *ochlou* (crowd) and the movement of the *diaporeuomenou* (passing through). He asks *ti ei touto* (what might this be?). His curiosity is the beginning of his salvation. Unlike the disciples who heard the prophecy of the Passion and understood nothing, this beggar hears the commotion and seeks the cause, preparing himself to cry out for mercy.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
οι δε απηγ απηγγιλαν δε αυτω οτι ο ναζω παρερχετε

**English Translation**
And they rep... reported to him that the Nazo[rean] is passing by.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the stutter in the scribe’s hand—*apēg apēggeilan*—as if the very ink hesitates to announce the mystery. The crowd reports that "the Nazorean" is passing. They use the title of His humility, the name of a village, unaware that the Lord of Glory walks within the dust of that road. The verb *parerchetai* (is passing by) is spelled phonetically, reflecting the common tongue; the Divine Word enters the common stream of time, yet He does not merely pass; He waits to be arrested by the cry of faith.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και εβοηϲεν λεγ ϋϊε ελεηϲ με ˙

**English Translation**
And he shouted, say[ing]: Son, have merc[y] on me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The blind man’s cry pierces the air. The text abbreviates his speech: *leg* for *legōn* (saying) and *eleēs* for *eleēson* (have mercy). But look at the Nomina Sacra: *Huië* (Son) is marked. Though he does not see the light of the sun, he perceives the Light of the World. He appeals to the filiation of the Messiah. He asks not for gold, but for *eleos*—the covenant mercy of God, distilled here into a desperate, truncated plea.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και οι προαγοντεϲ επετιμων αυτω ϊνα ϲιωπηϲη ο δε πολλω μαλλον εκραζεν δ ελεηϲον με ˙

**English Translation**
And those leading the way were rebuking him that he might be silent; but he much more was crying out: D[avid], have mercy on me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "leaders" (*proagontes*) attempt to silence the beggar, for the world often deems the cry of the poor an interruption to its procession. Yet, opposition only fans the flame of prayer. The text here offers a singular mystery: the letter *Delta* (δ) stands alone before the plea for mercy. It is the scribal cipher for *David*. The blind man needs only a syllable to invoke the Royal House. He cries to the King by the cipher of his ancestor, demanding the inheritance of the Kingdom: mercy.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ϲτα δε ο εκελευ αυτον αχθη προϲ αυτον εγγιϲαντοϲ δε αυ επηρωτηϲεν αυτον

**English Translation**
But stand[ing], the [Jesus] command[ed] him to be led to him; and [as] he [was] drawing near, he asked him:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Stas* (Standing). The Unmoved Mover stops in His tracks. The motion of the Creator halts for the creature. The text is ragged here—*ekeleu* for commanded, *au* for him—as if the urgency of the command rushes the pen. He orders the man to be "led" (*achthē*), using the hands of others to bridge the gap, turning the hinderers of the previous verse into helpers. The question is posed not because the Knower of Hearts is ignorant, but to grant the man the dignity of distinct desire.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
τι ϲοι θε ποιηϲω ˙ ὁ δε ειπεν ανα

**English Translation**
What [do you] w[ill] I shall do to you? And he said: [That I may] see again.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord asks, "What do you will?" (*the[leis]*). He aligns the human will with the Divine power. The beggar’s response is cut short in the manuscript: *ana*. This is the root of *anablepsō*—literally, "to look up." It is not merely sight he requests, but the upward gaze, the restoration of the beatific vision lost in Adam. He desires to lift his eyes from the dust to the face of God.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και ο ει αυτω αναβλε η πιϲτιϲ ϲου ϲεϲωκεν ϲε ˙

**English Translation**
And the [Jesus] sa[id] to him: Receive sight; your faith has saved you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The fiat of creation is spoken again: *Anable[pson]* (Receive sight). As light was called forth from darkness in the beginning, so now illumination is called forth from blindness. The Lord attributes this miracle to *pistis* (faith). It is faith that draws the power of salvation (*sesōken*) from the Divine nature. To see Christ is to be saved; the physical miracle is but the sacrament of the spiritual reality.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
και παραχρημα ανε και ηκο αυτον αυτω δο τον κ(αι) παϲ ο λαοϲ εδωκεν αινον τω ˙

**English Translation**
And immediately he saw [again] and follow[ed] him, glorifying the [God]; and all the people gave praise to the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Parachrēma*—immediately. Grace does not tarry. The restoration of sight results instantly in discipleship: he *followed* (*ēko[louthei]*). He does not go his own way but walks the way of the Cross. He becomes a living doxology, *doxazōn* (glorifying) the [God]. The text ends abruptly with *tō* (to the [God]), leaving the object of praise understood but unwritten, pointing us into the silence of adoration. The entire people join this chorus; the one man's healing becomes the community's liturgy.
