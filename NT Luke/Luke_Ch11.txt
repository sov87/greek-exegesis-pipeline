**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και εγε εν τω ειναι αυτον εν τοπω τινι προϲευχομε ωϲ επαυϲα ειπεν τιϲ των μαθητων αυτου προϲ αυτον δι ημαϲ προϲ καθωϲ ϊωαννηϲ κ(αι) ϊωαννηϲ εδιδαξεν τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in his being in a certain place praying, as he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: Because of us [teach us] to pray, just as John and John taught his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We observe here the scribe’s hand trembling under the weight of the request. The text reads *di hemas* ("because of us" or "for our sake") where we might expect *didaxon hemas* ("teach us"). It is as if the disciple claims the prayer not merely for instruction, but as a necessity for their very existence—"for our sake, Lord!" Furthermore, the name of the Forerunner, *Ioannes*, is written twice (*Ioannes k(ai) Ioannes*), a stutter of reverence. The disciple invokes the Baptist’s tradition to spur the Savior, seeking a distinct mark of identity for the followers of the Christ.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτοιϲ ο προϲευχηϲθε λεγετε · πατερ αγιαϲθητω το ονομα ϲου · ελθατω η βαϲιλι ϲου · γενηθητω το θελημα ϲου ωϲ εν ουρανω ουτω και επι τηϲ γηϲ κ(αι) ρυϲαι ημαϲ απο του πονηρου

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Whenever you pray, say: Father, let be sanctified your name; let come your kingdom; let be done your will as in heaven so also on the earth; and deliver us from the evil one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold a reading of great density. This manuscript witnesses the expansion of the petition. Not only do we see the Kingdom (*basili*[a]), but also the doing of the Will on earth as in heaven, a phrase often reserved for the account of Matthew. Most striking is the immediate, premature plea: *kai rhusai hemas apo tou ponerou* ("and deliver us from the evil one") appearing here, before the bread or forgiveness. It is a cry of urgent eschatology; before we ask for food, we ask to be snatched from the jaws of the Enemy. The soul prioritizes safety from the Evil One above the sustenance of the belly.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
τον αρτον ημων τον επιουϲιον δοϲ η το καθ ημεραν

**English Translation**
Our bread, the substantial [daily] one, give [us] the [portion] day by day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is abbreviated, *dos h* likely standing for *dos hemin* (give us). The focus is on *epiousion*—the bread that is "above substance" or "for the coming day." By saying *to kath hemeran* (the [thing] according to the day), the Lord binds us to a cycle of daily dependence. We are not given a storehouse, but a ration; we are beggars at the gate of Grace, returning with every sunrise.

***

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και αφεϲ ημιν ταϲ αμαρτιαϲ ημων ωϲ και και γαρ αυτοι αφιε αφιο̣μεν παντι οφι ημιν και μη ειϲενεγκηϲ ημαϲ ειϲ πιραϲμ αλλα ρυϲ(αι) ημαϲ απο τ

**English Translation**
And forgive us our sins, as also—for also—we ourselves forgive, we forgive everyone indebted to us; and do not carry us into temptation, but deliver us from t[he...]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe wrestles with the magnitude of forgiveness, writing *kai kai gar* (as also also for) and stumbling over *aphiomen* (we forgive), correcting the spelling in the ink. This visual stutter reflects the difficulty of the command: it is hard for man to forgive. The verse ends abruptly: *alla rhus(ai) hemas apo t*—"but deliver us from t...". The text cuts off, leaving the "Evil One" (*tou ponerou*) unspoken, perhaps too terrifying to name fully a second time, or perhaps the silence indicates that if God delivers us, the "what" we are delivered from vanishes into nothingness.

***

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν προϲ αυ τιϲ εξ υμων εξει φιλον και πο προϲ αυ μεϲονυκτι μεϲονυκτιον μεϲονυκτιου και ειπη αυτω φιλε χρηϲον μοι τριϲ αρτουϲ

**English Translation**
And he said to th[em]: Who among you shall have a friend, and shall g[o] to him at midnight midnight of midnight, and say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the parable is physically etched into the parchment. The word for midnight appears in three forms: *mesonykti* (dative/locative?), *mesonyktion* (accusative), *mesonyktiou* (genitive). The scribe cycles through the cases as if the darkness of the hour is overwhelming. It is "midnight, at midnight, of midnight." This triple darkness underscores the desperation of the petitioner who seeks the "three loaves"—a Trinitarian shadow in the bread of hospitality?

***

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
επιδη φιλοϲ μου παρεγε εξ οδου προϲ με και ουκ εχω ο παραθηϲω αυτω

**English Translation**
Since a friend of mine arrived from a journey to me, and I have not what I shall set before him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The shame of the host is the engine of this prayer. *Parege* (arrived) is clipped; the host is breathless. To have "nothing to set before" a guest is a spiritual poverty; we go to God not because we are rich, but because we are empty vessels needing to be filled so that we may fill others. We pray to be conduits, not reservoirs.

***

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
κακεινοϲ εϲω αποκριθειϲ ειπη μη μοι κο παρεχε η η θυρα κεκλι και τα παιδι μου ειϲ την κοι μετ εμου ει και ου δυνα αναϲταϲ δου ϲοι

**English Translation**
And that one within answering might say: Do not cause me tr[oubles]; the the door has been sh[ut], and my childr[en] are with me in the be[d]; and I cannot, rising, gi[ve] to thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is heavy with abbreviations—*ko* for *kopous* (troubles), *kekli* for *kekleistai* (shut), *koi* for *koiten* (bed). The sleeper inside desires brevity; he wants the knocker to go away. The repetition of *he he* (the the) before "door" emphasizes the barrier. The door is doubly shut. But the spiritual lesson is contrary: God is not the sleeper; He is the Awakened One who desires our importunity.

***

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λεγω ϋμιν ει και ου δωϲει αυτω αναϲταϲ δια το ειναι φιλον αυτου δια δε γε γε την αναι αυτου εγερ δωϲει αυτω οϲων οϲον χρηζει

**English Translation**
I say to you, even if he will not give to him, rising because of being his friend, yet at least—at least—because of his shameles[sness], he will rise and give to him as much as much as he needs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the hinge of the parable: *anaideian* (abbreviated *anai*). It is often translated as persistence, but it means "shamelessness." The petitioner screams in the night without shame. The scribe repeats *ge ge* (at least, at least) and *oson oson* (as much as, as much as). The abundance of the giving matches the intensity of the asking. God responds to the soul that casts aside dignity to beg for grace.

***

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
κα ϋμιν λεγω αιτειτε και δοθη ϋμιν ζητει και ευρηϲετε κρουετε και ανυ ϋμιν ·

**English Translation**
And to you I say: Ask, and it shall be gi[ven] to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be ope[ned] to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imperatives are stark. *Zetei* (seek) appears in the singular or abbreviated form, while *aiteite* (ask) is plural. The promise *any* (abbreviated for *anoigesetai*) means the opening is guaranteed. The punctuation at the end marks a solemn pause. This is the charter of the Christian life: the active pursuit of the Divine Will.

***

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
παϲ γαρ ο αιτων λαμβανει ˙ και ο ζητων ευριϲκει και τω κρουον ανυγηϲετε ανυγηϲεται

**English Translation**
For everyone asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking it shall be opened [it shall be opened].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The universal law of grace. The scribe struggles with the future passive *anygesetai*, writing it twice with spelling variations (*anygesete anygesetai*). This doubling serves as a confirmation: It *shall* be opened; verily, it *shall*. No knock on the door of Mercy goes unheard, though the wood seems thick and the night dark.

***

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
τιϲ δε εξ υμων τ πατερα αιτηϲει αρτον μη λιθ λιθ επιδωϲει αυτω η ϊχθυν μη αν ϊχθυοϲ οφιν επιδωϲει αυτω

**English Translation**
But who of you, the father, shall ask for bread—not a stone, a stone will he hand to him? Or a fish—not instead of a fish a serpent will he hand to him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *lith* (stone) twice: *lithon lithon*. It emphasizes the absurdity—would a father give a stone, a stone? The *ophin* (serpent) stands in opposition to the *ichthyn* (fish). The fish is a symbol of Christ (IXTHYS); the serpent is the deceiver. A true father does not substitute the Savior with the Satan. The abbreviated *t* before *patera* connects the specific human father to the archetype.

***

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
η και αιτηϲει ω μη επιδωϲει αυτω ϲκορπιον

**English Translation**
Or also he shall ask for an e[gg]—not will he hand to him a scorpion?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word for egg is reduced to a single letter *O* (omega here acting for *oon*). It is a small, fragile request. The scorpion is the sting of death. The contrast is total: the egg holds the promise of life; the scorpion holds the poison of the end. The Lord assures us that the Heavenly Father does not mock the hunger of His children with deadly gifts.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν ϋμιϲ πονη οντεϲ οιδαται δοματα αγαθα διδοναι τοιϲ τε ϋμων πο μαλλον ο πα εξ ουρανου δωϲει αγιον τοιϲ αιτουϲιν αυ

**English Translation**
If therefore you, being evil, know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father from heaven give [a] holy [thing] to those asking him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the sharp contrast the Lord draws between the nature of men and the nature of God. He labels the listeners "evil" (*πονηροι*), not to condemn them utterly, but to highlight the disparity between human frailty and divine perfection. If even in a fallen state, paternal affection compels you to provide "good gifts" to your offspring (*τεκνοις*), how infinite must be the generosity of the "Father from heaven"? The text here promises that He will give "a holy thing" (*αγιον*)—singular and potent. While other evangelists may speak of the Spirit specifically, this reading emphasizes the essence of the gift: it is Holiness itself, the very nature of God imparted to the supplicant. We ask not merely for material bread, but for that which is set apart and sanctified.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και ην εκβαλλ δαιμονιον κω εγενετο δε του δαιμονιου ε ελα ο κωφοϲ και εθαυμαϲαν οι οχλοι ·

**English Translation**
And he was casting out a demon, [a] mute [one]; and it came to pass, the demon [having gone] out, the mute spoke; and the crowds marveled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we witness the liberation of the tongue through the expulsion of the enemy. The demon is described as *κωφον* (mute), silencing the praise of God in its victim. The scribe’s abbreviation *ε* likely stands for the moment of exit (*εξελθοντος*), a swift departure at the Lord's command. Once the spiritual blockage is removed, the physical faculty is restored—the mute speaks (*ελαλησεν*). This teaches us that spiritual oppression often manifests as an inability to confess the truth. The marveling of the crowds is the natural response to the restoration of the human person to his proper function: the glorification of his Creator.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
τινεϲ δε εξ αυτων ειπ εν βεεζεβουλ τω αρχοντι των δαι εκβαλ τα δαιμονια

**English Translation**
But some of them said, 'By Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons, he casts out the demons.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Malice blinds the intellect. Confronted with a miracle of liberation, the skeptics attribute the work of Light to the Prince of Darkness. They name "Beelzebul," the lord of flies or filth, as the source of Christ’s authority. This is the height of absurdity: to suggest that the ruler of chaos would act to restore order and wholeness. By claiming He casts out (*εκβαλλει*) demons by the demonic ruler, they accuse the Physician of being in league with the plague. It is a warning to us: when we despise a brother’s good work, we risk blaspheming the source of that good.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ετεροι δε πιραζ πιραζ ϲημιον εξ ου εζητουν παρ αυτου

**English Translation**
And others, tempting [tempting], were seeking from him a sign from heaven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text exhibits a repetition, *πιραζοντες πιραζοντες* (tempting, tempting), emphasizing the relentless and nagging nature of their disbelief. They are not satisfied with the healing of the mute man on earth; they demand a spectacle from the sky (*εξ ουρανου*). This is the error of the unfaithful heart: it ignores the grace present before its eyes while demanding a different, more grandiose proof. They seek a "sign" (*σημειον*), yet they miss the Sign of the Incarnate Word standing in their midst. True faith sees God in the quiet restoration of a soul, not merely in thunder from the heavens.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ δε ειδωϲ αυτων τα διανοηματα ειπεν αυτοιϲ πα βαϲιλεια διαμε εφ εαυτ εαυτ ερημουται και οι επι οικον πι

**English Translation**
But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them: 'Every kingdom divided against itself [itself] is desolated; and house falls upon house.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord perceives the interior workings of their minds (*διανοηματα*). He answers their silent malice with a universal axiom of governance. A kingdom (*βασιλεια*) cannot survive internal partition (*διαμερισθεισα*). The scribe’s repetition *εφ εαυτην εαυτην* (against itself itself) underscores the suicidal nature of such division. Civil war is the death of the state; likewise, schism is the death of the ecclesial community. The phrase "house upon house falls" (*οικος επι οικον πιπτει*) paints a picture of total structural collapse. If Satan were to war against his own minions, his dominion of terror would crumble instantly.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ει δε και ο ϲα εφ εαυτον εμεριϲθη πωϲ ϲτα η βαϲιλει αυτου τι οτι οτι λεγετε εν βεεζεβουλʼ εκ με τα δαι

**English Translation**
But if also Satan was divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because [that] you say [that] by Beelzebul I cast out the demons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ applies the logic directly to the Adversary (*ο Σατανας*). If the healing of the mute man is an act of Satan against Satan, then the kingdom of evil is in its death throes. But the premise is false, and thus their accusation is folly. The Lord asks, "How will it stand?" (*πως σταθησεται*). Evil, though chaotic, possesses a unified hatred of the Good. It does not perform acts of mercy to sabotage itself. The repetition *οτι οτι* (because that that) in the text reflects the Lord’s emphatic dismantling of their reasoning: "Because you say... I cast out." He forces them to face the impossibility of their own claim.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ει δε εγω εν βεεζεβουλ εκ τα δαιμο οι υϊοι εν τινι εκβαλλουϲ εκβαλλουϲ δια τουτο αυτοι κριται εϲονται ϋ

**English Translation**
But if I by Beelzebul cast out the demons, by whom do the sons cast [them] out? Therefore *they* will be judges of you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The argument shifts to their own kin. The "sons" (*υιοι*)—likely Jewish exorcists of their own tradition—also claim to cast out spirits. If Christ uses demonic power, do they accuse their own children of the same sorcery? The stutter in the text, *εκβαλλουσιν εκβαλλουσιν*, perhaps captures the incredulity of the question. By condemning Him, they condemn their own religious practice. Thus, their own sons become their judges (*κριται*), exposing their hypocrisy. They accept the fruit when gathered by their own, but call it rotten when gathered by the Son of Man.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ει δε εν δα εγω εγω εκβαλ τα δαιμονια αρα εφθαϲεν ε υμαϲ η βαϲιλει του

**English Translation**
But if by [the] finger [of God?] I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of [God] has come upon you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A verse of immense theological weight. The text reads *εν δακτυλω* (by the finger), recalling the magicians of Pharaoh who confessed, "This is the finger of God" (Exodus 8:19). Where Matthew speaks of the Spirit, Luke preserve's the Lord's allusion to divine power that is effortless and direct. The double *εγω εγω* (I, I) emphasizes Christ's personal agency as the wielder of this power. If this is so, then the Kingdom (*βασιλεια*) has not merely approached; it has arrived unexpectedly (*εφθασεν*) upon them. The abrupt ending of the verse in the manuscript, *του* (of the...), leaves "God" implied but unwritten, as if the holy name is too fearful to inscribe, yet the reality of His Kingdom is undeniable.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
οταν ο ο ϊϲχυ καθωπλιϲμε φυλαϲϲη τ τ εαυτου αυλην ε ειρηνη εϲται τα ϋπαρχοντα αυ

**English Translation**
When the strong [one], fully armed, guards his own court, in peace are his possessions.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "strong one" (*ισχυρος*) is the devil, who holds the world in the tyranny of sin. He is "fully armed" (*καθωπλισμενος*), relying on the weapons of despair, accusation, and death. As long as he is unchallenged, his goods—the souls of men—are "in peace" (*εν ειρηνη*), a false peace of undisturbed slavery. The scribal doubling of the article *ο ο* and *τη τη* (the the) draws our eye to the specific identity of this tyrant and the specific boundaries of his court (*αυλην*). He guards jealously what he has stolen.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
επαν δε ϊϲχυ αυτου εϲτ επελθων νικηϲη αυτον την πανο αυτου ερει εφ η επεποιθει και τα ϲκυλα αυτου διαδιδωϲιν

**English Translation**
But when [one] stronger than he [is/comes] upon [him] and conquers him, he takes away his armor in which he had trusted, and distributes his spoils.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ is the *ισχυροτερος*—the One Stronger. The text uses *εστ* (is/exists) or perhaps an abbreviation for *ερχεται* (comes), indicating the inevitability of this confrontation. When Christ comes upon the tyrant, He does not negotiate; He conquers (*νικηση*). He strips away the "armor" (*πανοπλιαν*)—the lies and fears in which the devil trusted (*επεποιθει*). The result is the distribution of spoils (*σκυλα*). We are those spoils! Once captives of the enemy, we are now distributed as gifts of grace to the Church. The Victor plunders hell to populate heaven.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ο μη ων μετ εμου κα εμου εϲτιν και ο μη ϲυναγων με εμου ϲκορπιζει με με

**English Translation**
He who is not with me is against me; and he who does not gather with me scatters [me me].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Neutrality is impossible in this war between the Strong One and the Stronger One. One must gather (*συναγων*) with Christ or be found in opposition (*κατ' εμου*). The reading *σκορπιζει με με* (scatters me me) is peculiar and profound. While typically understood as "scatters abroad," the accusative "me" suggests that he who does not gather with Christ attempts to scatter Christ Himself—to rend His Body, the Church. To fail to unify is to participate in the crucifixion, the scattering of the Lord's presence. There is no middle ground; one is either a gatherer of souls or a destroyer of the Divine unity.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
οταν το ακαθαρ π π εξελθη απο του ανθρω διερχεται δι ανυδρων τοπ ζητουν αναπαυϲ αναπαυϲ και μη ευριϲκον τοτε λεγει ειϲ τον οικον μου οθεν εξηλθον

**English Translation**
When the unclean spirit [spirit] has gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest [rest]; and not finding [it], then it says: '[I will return] into my house from where I came out.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord describes the peril of a partial conversion. The unclean spirit (*ακαθαρτον πνευμα*) is expelled, wandering "waterless places" (*ανυδρων τοπων*)—the desert wastes where life cannot flourish. The repetition *αναπαυσιν αναπαυσιν* (rest rest) conveys the demon's frantic, insatiable hunger for a dwelling place; evil finds no peace in itself. Finding none, it resolves to return to its former vessel, arrogantly calling the human soul "my house" (*τον οικον μου*). This is a warning: to be emptied of evil is not enough; one must be filled with the "Holy Thing" (v. 13) and the "Finger of God" (v. 20), lest the vacuum invite a sevenfold return of darkness.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**

και ελθον ευριϲκι ϲχολαζοντα ϲεϲαρωμενον και κεκοϲμημε


**English Translation**

And having come, it finds [it] at leisure, swept, and adorne[d].


**Episcopal Exegesis**

Observe the danger of the vacuum. The unclean spirit returns to find the soul *ϲχολαζοντα* (at leisure, unoccupied). It is not enough to be *ϲεϲαρωμενον* (swept) of vice; one must be furnished with the furniture of the Spirit. The text here cuts off at *κεκοϲμημε* (adorned), a fitting truncation, for the adornment of a hypocrite is never complete, being merely external appearance without the indwelling Christ.


**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**

τοτε πορευετε κ(αι) παραλαμβανι μεθ ε ε ετερα π πονηροτερα εαυ επτα · και ειϲελ κατοικει ε και γινετε τα εϲχατα του α εκεινου χειρο των πρωτ


**English Translation**

Then it goes and takes along with i-i-itself other w-wickeder [than] itse[lf] seven; and enter[ing] it dwells t[here], and becomes the last things of that m[an] wors[e] than the firsts.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The scribe stammers here (*μεθ ε ε*, *π πονηροτερα*), as if trembling at the swarm of demons. The number seven signifies a fullness of malice. The soul, previously swept but empty, now becomes a fortress of legion. The text abbreviates the man (*του α*) and his state (*χειρο*), for the individual is consumed by the plurality of the possession. The final state is not merely bad, but *χειρο των πρωτ* (worse than the firsts), for apostasy is darker than paganism.


**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**

εγενετο δε εν τω λεγειν αυτον ταυ επαραϲα τιϲ φω γυνη εκ του οχλου ειπεν αυ μακαρια κοι η βαϲταϲαϲα ϲε και μαϲτοι ουϲ ε


**English Translation**

And it happened in his saying thes[e things], having lifted up a certain voi[ce] a woman out of the crowd said to hi[m]: Blessed [is] the wom[b] the [one] having borne you, and breasts which s[ucked].


**Episcopal Exegesis**

Here is the voice of fleshly admiration. The woman blesses the *κοι* (womb) and the physical nursing (*μαϲτοι*), fixating on the biological connection to the Holy One. The text is hurried, truncating *ταυτα* and *φωνην*, as if the Evangelist hastens to correct this earthly perspective. She sees the Son of Mary; she has not yet perceived the Son of God.


**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**

αυτοϲ δε ειπεν μενο μενο μακαριοι οι ακου τον λογον του και φυλαϲ τον λογον του


**English Translation**

But he said: Rather, rather blessed [are] the [ones] hear[ing] the word of the [God?] and keep[ing] the word of the [God?].


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The Lord corrects her with emphasis, suggested by the repetition or hesitation *μενο μενο* (nay rather). True blessedness is not in bearing Christ in the womb, but bearing Him in the heart. The scribe writes *τον λογον του* (the word of the...) twice, perhaps omitting the Nomina Sacra for God (*θυ*), yet the meaning stands: the blessing belongs to those *φυλαϲ* (guarding/keeping) the Logos. Bloodline profits nothing without obedience.


**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**

των δε ο επαθροι ηρξα λεγειν η γενε αυτη γενεα πο εϲτιν ϲημι ζητει και ϲη ου δοθηϲε αυτη ει μη το ϲημιον ϊωνα


**English Translation**

And of the c[rowds] gathering together, he began to say: This gener[ation] is a wic[ked] generation; it seeks a sig[n], and a sig[n] will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The crowds thicken (*επαθροι*), yet their intent is *πο* (wicked). They demand a *ϲημι* (sign) to satisfy their eyes, refusing the truth addressed to their ears. The Lord offers only the sign of Jonah (*ϊωνα*): the mystery of the descent into death and the return. He who seeks a spectacle loses the Savior; he who accepts the mystery of the Tomb finds the Resurrection.


**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**

κα εγενετο τοιϲ νινευει ϲημειον ου εϲται και ο του ανθρωπου τη γενεα ταυτη


**English Translation**

A[s] [Jonah] became to the Ninevi[tes] a sign, s[o] shall be also the [Son] of Man to this generation.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

Typology is the language of God. As Jonah was a sign to the *νινευει* (Ninevites) through his deliverance from the beast, so the Son of Man is a sign through His deliverance from the earth. The text omits *υιοϲ* (Son) before *του ανθρωπου*, yet the Title is undeniable. He is the Sign itself, a stumbling block to the wicked, but salvation to the repentant.


**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**

βαϲι νοτου εγερ εν τη κρι μετα των αν ανδρων τηϲ γε ταυτηϲ και κατακρινι αυτουϲ οτι ηλθεν εκ τ τ περατων τηϲ γηϲ ακουϲαι την ϲο ϲολομωνοϲ και ϊδου πλειον ϲο ωδε ·


**English Translation**

[The] Quee[n] of the South will be rais[ed] in the judg[ment] with the m-men of this gener[ation] and will condemn them; because she came from t-the ends of the earth to hear the wis[dom] of Solomon, and behold, more than Sol[omon] [is] here.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The Gentile rises to shame the Jew. The *βαϲι* (Queen) traveled vast distances for human wisdom (*ϲολομωνοϲ*), while Israel ignores Divine Wisdom standing in their midst (*ωδε*). The stuttering *τ τ περατων* emphasizes the great distance she traversed. *Πλειον ϲο* (more than Solomon): Christ is the substance of which Solomon was but a shadow. To reject the Reality while claiming to revere the shadow is the definition of judgment.


**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**

αν νινευειται αναϲτηϲονται εν τη κριϲι μετα τηϲ γενεαϲ ταυτηϲ και κατακρινουϲ αυτην οτι μετε ειϲ το κη και ϊ πλειον ωδε


**English Translation**

Men, Ninevites, will stand up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because they repent[ed] at the procla[mation] of J[onah], and [behold], more [than Jonah] [is] here.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The men of Nineveh (*αν νινευειται*) repented at a mere *κη* (proclamation, truncated from *κηρυγμα*) of a reluctant prophet. This generation rejects the Lord of Prophets. The comparison is devastating: Gentiles heard a servant and wept; Israel hears the Son and scoffs. The phrase *πλειον ωδε* (more is here) rings as a knell of doom for those who despise the greater grace.


**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**

ουδειϲ λυχνον α ειϲ κρυπτην τιθηϲιν ουδε τον μοδιον αλλ ε την λυχνιαν · ϊνα οι ειϲπορευο το φωϲ βλε ·


**English Translation**

No one, having lit a lamp, places [it] into a hidden place, nor [under] the bushel, but upo[n] the lampstand, in order that the [ones] enterin[g] might s[ee] the light.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The Gospel cannot be hidden. The *λυχνον* (lamp) is the Word; the *λυχνιαν* (lampstand) is the Church or the Cross. To place it under a *μοδιον* (bushel) is the act of heretics who obscure the truth, or cowards who fear to preach it. The purpose of the light is for those *ειϲπορευο* (entering in)—the catechumens and the nations—that they might *βλε* (see). The truncation of the verb "to see" suggests the immediacy of the vision.


**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**

ο λυχνοϲ του ϲωματοϲ εϲτ εϲτ ο οφθαλμοϲ ϲου ο ο οφθαλμοϲ ϲου απλουϲ η και ο το ϲωμα ϲου φωτινον εϲτιν επαν δε πονηροϲ η και ολον το ϲωμα ϲου ϲκοτινον


**English Translation**

The lamp of the body i-is the the the eye of you. [When] the eye of you might be single, also the who[le] body of you is full of light; but whenever it might be evil, also the whole body of you [is] dark.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The *οφθαλμοϲ* (eye) is the *nous*, the intellect and intent of the soul. If it is *απλουϲ* (single, simple, uncompounded by duplicity), the whole man is luminous. But if the intent is *πονηροϲ* (evil/diseased), the corruption spreads to every action. The scribe’s repetition (*εϲτ εϲτ*, *ο ο οφθαλμοϲ*) draws attention to the critical nature of spiritual vision. A distorted dogma darkens the entire life.


**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**

ϲκοπι ουν μη το φωϲ το εν ϲοι ϲκοτοϲ εϲτ


**English Translation**

Watch out therefore lest the light that [is] in you is darkness.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

A fearful admonition: *ϲκοπι* (watch/examine). It is possible to possess a "light" that is actually *ϲκοτοϲ* (darkness). This is the state of the heretic who mistakes his own error for divine illumination. We must constantly test our "light" against the Rule of Faith, lest we be found walking confidently into the pit.


**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**

ει ουν το ϲω>>> ϲου ολον φω μη εχον τι μεροϲ ϲκοτινον εϲται φωτινον ο ωϲ οταν ο λυ τη αϲτραπη φωτιζη τ ϲε


**English Translation**

If therefore the bo[dy] of you [is] whole, lig[ht], not having any part dark, it will be full of light, who[lly] as when the lam[p] with the lightning-flash might enlighten t[hee].


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The goal of the Christian life: total illumination. When no part remains dark (*μη εχον τι μεροϲ ϲκοτινον*), the believer becomes *φωτινον* (full of light), reflecting the uncreated Light. The comparison to *αϲτραπη* (lightning) suggests the piercing, sudden, and overwhelming nature of Glory. The text ends with *φωτιζη τ ϲε* (enlightens thee), indicating that this light is not from ourselves, but received from the Lamp that is Christ.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
εν δε τω λαληϲαι ερωτα αυτον φαριϲαιοϲ οπωϲ αριϲτηϲη παρ αυτω ειϲελθ ειϲελθ δε ανεπεϲεν

**English Translation**
And in the speaking, a Pharisee asks him so that he might dine with him; and having entered [entered], he reclined.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the immediacy of the encounter: "in the speaking" (*en tō lalēsai*), the invitation is extended. The text here bears a curious repetition, *eiselth eiselth* ("entered entered"), a scribal stutter that we might spiritually interpret as the profound emphasis on the Incarnate Word entering the house of the Law. He does not hesitate or perform a ritual ablution at the threshold; He enters and immediately reclines (*anepesen*), taking His place as the Judge at the table of legalism.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ο δε φαριϲαιοϲ ϊδων ε οτι ου πρωτον εβαπτιϲθη προ του αριϲτου

**English Translation**
But the Pharisee, seeing, [marveled] that he was not first baptized before the dinner.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates the reaction simply as *e* (likely for *ethaumasen*, marveled). The Pharisee’s astonishment is rooted in the external order. He looks for water upon the skin (*ebaptisthē*) before the meal (*aristou*). He sees the lack of ritual washing as a defect, blind to the Fountain of Living Water sitting before him who requires no cleansing.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ο κ προϲ αυτον νυν ϋμειϲ οι φαριϲαιοι το ε του ποτη και του πινα καθαριζεται ˙ το δε εϲωθεν ϋμ γεμει αρπαγηϲ κ(αι) πονηριαϲ

**English Translation**
But the Lord said to him: "Now you Pharisees cleanse the [outside] of the cup and of the platter; but the inside of you is full of rapacity and wickedness."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord (*Kyrios*, abbreviated *k*) strikes at the dichotomy of the vessel. The text abbreviates "the outside" as *to e* and the vessels as *potē* (cup) and *pina* (platter). The external polish is contrasted violently with the internal contents: *harpagēs* (rapacity/plunder) and *ponērias* (wickedness). The soul of the legalist is a clean cup filled with poison; they maintain the surface to hide the rot within.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ο αφρο ουχ ο ποιηϲαϲ το εξωθεν και το ε εποιηϲ εποιηϲ .

**English Translation**
You fools, did not the One having made the outside also make the [inside] [made]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sharp rebuke: *aphrones* (fools/senseless ones). The text again stutters with *epoiēs epoiēs* (made made). The argument is theological and cosmological: God is the Creator of the total man. To sanitize the flesh (the outside) while neglecting the spirit (the inside, *to e*) is to deny the sovereignty of the Creator over the hidden parts of the human heart.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
πλην τα ενοντα δοτε ελεημοϲυν και ϊδου παντα κα ϋμιν εϲτιν ˙

**English Translation**
However, give the things being within [as] alms, and behold, all things are clean to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the remedy for the internal "rapacity" mentioned in verse 39. Instead of ritual water, the Lord demands *eleēmosynēn* (alms/mercy). By giving from "the things within" (*ta enonta*)—meaning the contents of the heart or one's substance—the entire vessel becomes *kathara* (clean). Charity effects a purification that water cannot.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
αλλα ουαι ϋμιν τοιϲ φαριϲαιοιϲ οτι απο το η ηδυοϲμον και το πη και παν τ̣ο̣ λαχα και παρερχε την κριϲιν κ(αι) την αγαπην του ταυτα δε εδει ποι κακεινα μη αφειναι παρειναι

**English Translation**
But woe to you Pharisees, for [you tithe] the mint and the rue and every herb, and pass by the judgment and the love of God; but these things it was necessary to do, and those things not to leave [to pass by].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is dense with abbreviations (*apo* for tithe, *la-cha* for herbs). The scribe repeats the *eta* in *hē hēdyosmon* (mint). The condemnation is for inverted priorities: they measure the smallest garden herbs (*pēganon*, rue) with mathematical precision but "pass by" (*parerchesthe*) the weightier matters: *krisin* (judgment/justice) and *agapēn* (love). The final phrase *apheinai pareinai* suggests a textual correction or emphasis: do not omit, do not pass by.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν φαριϲαι οτι αγαπατε τ τ πρωτοκαθεδρι εν ταιϲ ϲυνα και τουϲ αϲπαϲμουϲ εν ταιϲ αγοραιϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the [the] first seat in the synagogues and the greetings in the marketplaces.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stammers again (*t t* for "the"). The sin here is the lust for preeminence (*prōtokathedrian*). They seek the "first seat" in the sacred assembly (*synagōgais*) and public adulation in the *agorais*. Their piety is a performance for the applause of men, turning the holy synagogue into a theater of pride.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν οτι εϲ ωϲ τα μνημι τα αδηλα και οι ανθρωποι οι πε ε ουκ οιδαϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Woe to you, for you are as the indistinct tombs, and the men walking over [them] do not know.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying metaphor. They are *mnēmeia adēla* (unseen/indistinct tombs). According to the Law, touching a grave brings defilement. By concealing their inner corruption, the Pharisees become hidden traps; the people walk over them (*peripatountes epanō*) and are spiritually defiled without even knowing (*ouk oidasin*). Hypocrisy is a contagion that spreads through invisible contact.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε τιϲ των νομικων λεγει αυτω διδα ταυτα λε και ημαϲ ϋ ·

**English Translation**
And answering, a certain one of the lawyers says to him: "Teacher, saying these things, you insult us also."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *nomikos* (lawyer/expert in the law) perceives the scope of the Lord's attack. He complains that Christ's words *hubrizeis* (insult/reproach) them. He is more concerned with his professional dignity than the truth of the accusation. He appeals to the title *Didaskale* (Teacher, abbreviated *dida*), hoping to bring the Lord back to polite discourse, but he unwittingly invites further judgment.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν και ϋ τοιϲ νομι ουαι οτι φορ τουϲ ανθρω φορτια δυϲ και αυ ενι των δακτυ ου προϲ τοιϲ φορ

**English Translation**
But he said: "Also to you lawyers, woe! For [you load] men with burdens hard to bear, and [you] yourselves with one of [your] fingers do not [touch] the burdens."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord turns upon the scribes. The text is heavily abbreviated (*phortia* for burdens, *dys* for hard to bear). The "woe" is for the asymmetry of their theology: they manufacture heavy loads (*phortia*) for the laity but will not even *psauete* (touch, implied by context of *pros*) the weight with a single finger (*daktylō*). They are architects of a law that crushes others while they remain untouched.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν οτι οικο τα μνη των προφη και οι οι δε πατε ϋμων απεκτι αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
Woe to you, for you build the tombs of the prophets, but your fathers killed them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They engage in *oikodomeite* (building) the monuments of the martyrs. Yet, this act of masonry is an indictment. By identifying with the "fathers" who *apekteinan* (killed) the prophets, and by rejecting the Prophet standing before them, they prove the continuity of rebellion. They honor the dead prophets only because the dead cannot rebuke them.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
αρα μαρτυρεϲ εϲτε και ϲυνευδοκειτε τοιϲ εργοιϲ των πατερων ϋμ οτι αυτοι μεν α αυτουϲ ϋμειϲ δε οικοδο

**English Translation**
Consequently you are witnesses and consent to the works of your fathers; for they indeed [killed] them, but you build.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The conclusion is devastating. *Ara martyres este* (So you are witnesses). They *syneudokeite* (approve/consent together) with the murders of the past. The fathers did the killing (*a* for *apekteinan*), and the sons do the building (*oikodo*). The tomb is the seal of the murder. By sealing the prophets in stone, they attempt to finalize the silence their fathers initiated.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
δια τουτο κ(αι) η ϲοφια του ει αποϲτελω ειϲ αυτουϲ προ και αποϲτο και εξ αυτ αυτ αποκτινουϲιν αποκτενουϲιν κ(αι) διωξουϲιν

**English Translation**
On account of this also the Wisdom of the [God] said: I will send into them pro[phets] and apost[les], and out of them them they will kill they will kill and they will persecute.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the Divine Wisdom speaking as a person, possessing the authority to send forth messengers. The scribe, in his haste or perhaps overcome by the weight of the prophecy, has left us with truncated forms—`προ` for prophets, `αποστο` for apostles—yet the meaning remains sharp. Most striking is the double writing of `εξ αυτ αυτ` (out of them, them) and `αποκτινουϲιν αποκτενουϲιν` (they will kill, they will kill). While a copyist might call this error, the spiritual eye sees emphasis: the certainty of martyrdom is doubled. The persecution is not a possibility; it is a fixed future. The Wisdom of God does not send His servants into safety, but into the very jaws of death, that the witness might be sealed in blood.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα εκ εκδηκηθη το αιμα παντων των προ το εκχυν απο καταβοληϲ κοϲμου απο τηϲ γενεαϲ ταυτηϲ

**English Translation**
In order that might be req- required the blood of all the pro[phets] the poured out from foundation of world from this generation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers `εκ εκδηκηθη` (req- required/avenged), as if the very demand for justice trembles with intensity. The blood of the prophets is described as `το εκχυν`—that which has been poured out like a libation. This is not merely murder; it is a sacrificial pouring that has accumulated since the `καταβοληϲ κοϲμου` (foundation of the world). The charge is laid specifically `απο τηϲ γενεαϲ ταυτηϲ` (from this generation). All history's rejected grace culminates in the present moment; the cup of iniquity is full, and the accounting is now due.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
απο αιμα αβελʼ εωϲ αι ζαχαριου του απολομενου μετοξυ μεταξυ του θυϲι και του οικου ναι λεγω ϋμιν εκζητηθη απο τηϲ γε ταυτηϲ

**English Translation**
From blood of Abel until bl[ood] of Zacharias the [one] destroyed betw- between the altar and the house; yes I say to you, it will be sought out from this gen[eration].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We trace the lineage of martyrdom from the first shepherd, Abel, to the priest Zacharias. The manuscript reveals a struggle in the word `μετοξυ μεταξυ` (between), corrected to ensure we know the exact locus of the crime: `του θυϲι` (the altar) and `του οικου` (the House/Temple). To slay a priest in the sanctuary is the height of sacrilege. The abbreviated `γε` (generation) at the end speeds the sentence to its terrifying conclusion: `εκζητηθη` (it will be sought out). God is the Seeker of blood, not to drink it, but to answer its cry from the earth.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν τοιϲ νο οτι ηρα την κλειδα τηϲ γνωϲεωϲ αυτοι ουκ ειϲηλθατε και τουϲ ειϲερχο εκωλυ ·

**English Translation**
Woe to you the law[yers], because [you] took the key of knowledge; yourselves entered not and the [ones] enter[ing] [you] hindered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The `νο` (lawyers) are indicted for a terrible theft: they `ηρα` (took/lifted) the `κλειδα τηϲ γνωϲεωϲ` (key of knowledge). The key is the correct understanding of Scripture which unlocks the door to Christ. By twisting the law, they have not only barred their own entry (`ουκ ειϲηλθατε`) but have actively `εκωλυ` (hindered) the simple faithful who were `ειϲερχο` (entering). It is the unique sin of the scholar to turn the medicine of the Word into a poison of obstruction. They stand in the doorway, neither going in nor letting others pass.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
κακειθεν εξελθοντοϲ αυ ηρξαντο οι γραμματειϲ και οι φαριϲαιοι δινωϲ ενεχιν και απο αυ περι πλειο

**English Translation**
And thence, [upon] his going out, began the scribes and the Pharisees terri[bly] to press in and to [question?] him concerning more [things].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reaction to truth is not repentance, but rage. As He exits, the religious authorities begin `δινωϲ ενεχιν`—to press upon Him terribly or vehemently. The verb `ενεχιν` implies holding a grudge or entrapping. The text here is rough, `απο αυ περι πλειο` (from him concerning more), suggesting a chaotic barrage of interrogations. They seek to provoke Him to speak `περι πλειο` (concerning more things), not to learn, but to find fault. The atmosphere has shifted from instruction to open hostility.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
ενεδρευον θηρευϲαι τι εκ του ϲτοματοϲ αυ

**English Translation**
Lying in wait [to] hunt something out of his mouth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The metaphor shifts to the predatory. `ενεδρευον` implies an ambush, a lying in wait. Their intent is `θηρευϲαι`—to hunt or catch prey. They treat the Incarnate Word as a beast to be snared. They listen intently to `του ϲτοματοϲ αυ` (his mouth), not to be fed by the Bread of Life, but to extract a deadly morsel of accusation. It is the ultimate perversion of listening: to hear the voice of God and hear only a trap.
