**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
μετα δε ταυτα α ο και ετερουϲ εβδομη και απεϲτι αυτουϲ ανα δυ προ προϲωπου αυτου ειϲ παϲαν πολιν και τοπον ου ημελλεν αυτοϲ ερχεϲθαι

**English Translation**
After these things the Lord appointed also others, seventy, and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine strategy of the *Kyrios*. He does not send the laborers alone, for the testimony of one may be doubted, but "two by two" ensures the witness is established, as the Law requires. The manuscript here reads *hebdomekonta* (seventy), mirroring the seventy elders of Moses. These are the precursors, the heralds sent *pro prosopou* (before the face) of the Incarnate Word, preparing the earth to receive the tread of His feet.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε προϲ αυτουϲ · ο μεν θεριϲμοϲ πο οι δε εργαται ο δεηθηται ο ο του του θεριϲμου · οπωϲ εκβαλη ερ ειϲ τον θερι αυτου

**English Translation**
And he said to them: The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few; pray therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send out laborers into his harvest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The field of the world is vast, teeming with souls ready for the scythe of truth, yet the *ergatai* (workers) are scarce. This is the perpetual lament of the Church. We are commanded to beseech the *Kyrios* of the harvest—acknowledging that the field belongs to God, not to us—that He might "cast out" (ekbale) workers. The verb implies a forceful urgency; the Spirit drives the apostles into the field, for the time is short.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ϋπα ϊδου αποϲτελ ϋμαϲ ωϲ αρναϲ εν μεϲω λυκων

**English Translation**
Go; behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the paradox of our faith: power perfected in weakness. He commands *hypagete* (go forth), not as conquerors with swords, but as *arnas* (lambs). The world is full of wolves—heretics, persecutors, and demons—yet the lamb conquers by the nature of the Shepherd. Innocence is our armor; we do not bite back, lest we become wolves ourselves.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
μη βαϲταζετε βαλ · μη πη · μη ϋποδημα και μηδενα κατα τ τ οδον αϲπαϲηϲθε

**English Translation**
Carry no purse, no scrip, no shoes; and salute no one along the way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The apostolic life demands total detachment. The *ballantion* (purse) and *peran* (beggar’s bag) represent reliance on material provision; the lack of shoes signifies the urgency of the message, touching the earth directly in humility. The command to salute no one is not incivility, but a prohibition against the long, winding formalities of Eastern greeting that delay the urgent proclamation of the Kingdom. The King's business requires haste.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
ειϲ ην δ αν ειϲελ οικιαν πρω λεγεται ειρη τω οικω τουτω

**English Translation**
And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say: Peace to this house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The first gift of the apostle is *eirene* (peace). Before doctrine is taught or bread is broken, the atmosphere must be sanctified by the peace of Christ. This peace is not merely a lack of conflict, but a positive, divine presence that invades the domestic sphere, turning a common house into a receptacle of grace.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και εαν η εκι ο υϊοϲ ειρηνηϲ επανα επαναπαυϲεται επ αυτ η ειρηνη ϋμων ει δε μη γε εφ ϋμαϲ ανακαμψει

**English Translation**
And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him; but if not, it shall return to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the tangible reality of the blessing. It is not a mere word that vanishes; it is a spiritual substance that seeks a resting place. If the host is a "son of peace"—predisposed by grace to receive the Gospel—the blessing remains. If the soil is stony, the peace *anakampsei* (bends back/returns) to the giver. The minister of God loses nothing when his blessing is rejected; the grace returns to his own bosom.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
εν αυ δε τη οικια με εϲθιοντεϲ και πινοντεϲ τα παρ αυτων · αξιοϲ γαρ ο εργατηϲ του μιϲθου αυτου μη μεταβαινετε εξ οι ειϲ οικιαν

**English Translation**
And in the same house remain, eating and drinking the things from them; for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not move from house to house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Stability is a virtue. The wandering teacher who seeks better food or softer beds brings scandal to the Gospel. The laborer is indeed worthy of sustenance—this is divine law—but he must be content with what is set before him. To move from house to house suggests one is seeking luxury rather than souls, turning the ministry into a trade for the belly.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ειϲ ην αν πολιν ειϲερχηϲθε και δεχωνται ϋμαϲ εϲθιετε τα παρατι

**English Translation**
And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat the things set before you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This command liberates the conscience. In the mission to the nations, we are not to scrutinize the plate with the legalism of the Pharisees. "Eat what is set before you" signifies that table fellowship and the acceptance of hospitality override the strictures of dietary purity. The Kingdom is not meat and drink, but righteousness.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) θεραπευετε τουϲ εν αυτη αϲθενιϲ και λεγετε αυτοιϲ ηγγικεν εφ ϋμαϲ η βαϲιλεια του

**English Translation**
And heal the sick in it, and say to them: The kingdom of God has come near to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Word and deed are inseparable. We *therapeuete* (heal) the body to demonstrate the power of the Spirit, and we proclaim the *Basileia* (Kingdom) to heal the soul. The message is one of proximity: the Kingdom is not far off in the heavens, but *engiken* (has come near), pressing upon the present moment through the presence of Christ’s ambassadors.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ειϲ ην δ αν πολιν ειϲελθητε και μη δεχωνται ϋμαϲ εξελθοντεϲ ειϲ ταϲ πλατιαϲ αυτηϲ ειπατε

**English Translation**
But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, going out into the streets of it, say:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Rejection must be met with a public testimony. The apostle does not retreat in secret shame but goes into the *plateias*—the broad streets and market squares—to render a verdict. The rejection of the Gospel is a public act, and the witness against that rejection must be equally public, vindicating the justice of God.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και τον κονι τον κολλη ϋμιν ημιν εκ τηϲ πολεωϲ ϋμων ειϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ α ϋ πλην τουτο γεινωϲκετε υμιϲ οτι ηγγεικεν η βα του

**English Translation**
Even the dust that cleaved to us from your city to the feet we wipe off against you; nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful sign. The wiping off of dust signifies a total severance of communion; we take nothing of yours, not even the dirt of your streets, into the Kingdom. Yet, the objective truth remains unchanged by their unbelief: "Know this," the Kingdom *has* come near. Their rejection does not stop the Kingdom; it only ensures they are excluded from it.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
λεγω δε οτι ϲοδο εν τη ημερα εκεινη ανεκτοτε εϲται η τη πολει εκινη ο̣υ̣α̣ι̣

**English Translation**
I say that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. Woe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe has preserved the terrifying "Woe" (*ouai*) at the end of this line, anticipating the judgment of Chorazin. The Lord teaches that judgment is proportional to light received. Sodom violated the laws of nature and hospitality, but they did not reject the incarnate Son of God or His direct apostles. To reject the Gospel is a greater crime than the sins of the flesh, for it is the rejection of the only remedy for sin.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ουαι ϲοι χοραζειν ουαι ϲοι βηθϲαϊδ βηθϲαϊδ οτι ει εν τυρω και ϲιδωνι εγενηθη αι δυναμιϲ αι γενομεναι εν υμ υμ παλαι αν εν ϲακκω και ϲποδω καθη μετενοη

**English Translation**
Woe to thee Chorazein, woe to thee Bethsaid Bethsaid; because if in Tyre and Sidon had happened the power[s] that happened in you you, long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes they would have repented.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the severity of the Lord’s lament. The scribe, perhaps trembling at the judgment, writes "Bethsaida" twice (*βηθϲαϊδ βηθϲαϊδ*), and truly the double woe befits the double hardness of heart. He speaks of "power" (*δυναμιϲ*) in the singular, though many miracles occurred; for all divine works flow from the one Power of the Godhead. The text stammers "in you you" (*εν υμ υμ*), emphasizing the personal guilt of those who see the Light yet choose darkness. The final word *μετενοη* is truncated; their repentance was cut short, or rather, never fully formed.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
πλην τυρω και ϲιδω ανεκτοτερον εϲται εν τη κριϲει η ϋμιν

**English Translation**
However for Tyre and Sido[n] it will be more tolerable in the judgment than for you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is a terrifying mystery. Tyre and Sidon, cities of ancient idolatry, find more mercy than the cities of the visitation. Why? Because knowledge brings weight. To whom much is given, much is required. The Codex abbreviates Sidon (*ϲιδω*), as if to hasten past the pagan names to focus on the judgment of the faithful. Let us not presume that proximity to the Word guarantees salvation; it guarantees only a stricter scrutiny.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και ϲυ κα μη εωϲ ουρανου ϋψωθηϲη εωϲ ο αδου καταβι

**English Translation**
And thou Ca[pharnaum], shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? Unto Ha[des] thou shalt descend.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the reading here carefully. The text does not say "thou shalt be thrust down" (passive), but *καταβι* (*katabi*), "thou shalt descend." The pride of Capharnaum—abbreviated here as *κα* to show its belittlement—is its own weight. The soul that seeks to exalt itself without God does not need to be pushed; it falls by the gravity of its own arrogance. It descends to Hades naturally, for it has severed the tether of grace.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ο ακου ακου εμου ακουει και ο αθετων εμε αθετει ο δε ε αθετων αθετει τον αποϲτιλαντα με

**English Translation**
The [one] hear hear[ing] me hears, and he rejecting me rejects; but he rejecting [me] rejects the [one] having sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound variant confronts us. The common texts say "He that hears *you*," but our Codex reads *ακου εμου*—"hears *me*." The scribe repeats *ακου* (hear), demanding our attention. The Lord identifies the apostles so closely with Himself that to hear the servant is to hear the Master directly. There is no distance. And note the chain of rejection: to reject the Son is to reject the Father (*τον αποϲτιλαντα*). There is no "God" accessible apart from the Sent One.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ϋπεϲτρεψαν δε οι εβδομηκοντα με χαραϲ λεγοντεϲ και τα δαιμονι ϋποταϲϲεται ημ ημ εν τω ονοματι ϲου

**English Translation**
And the seventy returned with joy saying, [Lord], even the demons are subjected to us us in thy name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They return with joy, but also with danger. See how the text doubles the pronoun *ημ ημ* ("to us, to us"). They are amazed that the spirits obey *them*. It is a subtle trap of pride. They attribute the subjection to their own agency, though they add "in thy name." The demons (*δαιμονι*) are indeed crushed, but the Bishop must warn the flock: do not rejoice that you have power, lest you become like the demons who fell through pride.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτοιϲ ε τον ϲα ωϲ αϲτραπ αϲτραπ εκ του ουρανου πε

**English Translation**
And he said to them: I [beheld] Sa[tan] as lightn lightn[ing] out of heaven fall[ing].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord corrects their focus immediately. While they looked at earthly victories, He beheld the cosmic reality. The text is jagged, abbreviating Satan (*ϲα*) and stuttering on "lightning" (*αϲτραπ αϲτραπ*). This repetition captures the sudden, flashing violence of the Arch-enemy's expulsion. He fell *πε* (falling)—the action is continuous in its effect. He was Light, became Lightning, and ends in darkness.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ϊδου δεδω ϋμιν την εξου του πατειν ε οφεων και ϲκορπιων και επι παϲαν την δυνα του εχθρου και ουδεν ϋμαϲ ου μη αδικηϲει

**English Translation**
Behold I have giv[en] to you the author[ity] to tread u[pon] serpents and scorpions and over all the powe[r] of the enemy, and nothing you shall in no wise hurt.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Distinguish, brethren, between *εξου* (authority) and *δυνα* (power). The enemy has *power*—raw force, like the scorpion's sting. But Christ gives us *authority*—the legal and spiritual right to trample that power. The serpent bites, but the foot of the Christian, shod in the Gospel, crushes it. The double negative *ου μη* (in no wise) assures us: though the body be killed, the soul cannot be injured by the adversary.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
πλην εν τουτω μη χαι χ οτι τα ϋμιν υποταϲϲεται χερετε δε οτι τα ο ϋμων εν εν τοιϲ ουρανοιϲ

**English Translation**
However in this do not rej[oice], that the [things] are subjected to you; but rejoice that the na[mes] of you [are] in in the heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Our Codex omits "spirits" (*πνευματα*), reading simply "that the [things] are subjected." This widens the scope—all creation is subject to the new man in Christ. Yet, the command is *μη χαι* (do not rejoice) in power. The true cause for joy is inscribed elsewhere. The scribe repeats *εν εν* ("in in the heavens"), anchoring our hope deeply in the celestial realm. Your name is written in the Book of Life; this is grace, whereas miracles are merely gifts.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
εν αυτη τη ωρα ηγαλλιαϲα εν τω π τω ︴ α και ειπε̣ν ειπα̣ν ειπεν · εξο ϲοι πατερ του ουρα και τηϲ γηϲ ο απεκρυψαϲ ταυ απο ϲοφων και ϲυνετων και απε αυτα νη ναι ο πατηρ οτι ουτωϲ εγενετο ευδοκια εμπροϲθ εμπροϲθ ϲου

**English Translation**
In that hour he rejoiced in the S[pirit] the H[oly] and said said said: I confess to thee, Father of heav[en] and of earth, [that] thou hidest thes[e things] from wise and prudent and reveal[ed] them to babes; yea, Father, for so it became good pleasure befor befor[e] thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the Trinity! The Son rejoices in the Spirit (*π τω ︴ α*) to the Father. The scribe struggles with the magnitude of the utterance, writing *ειπε̣ν ειπα̣ν ειπεν* ("said said said"), as if the word echoed in eternity. God hides truth from the "wise" (the philosophers of this age) and gives it to *νη* (babes/infants)—those simple in heart. The repetition *εμπροϲθ εμπροϲθ* ("before before thee") emphasizes the immediacy of the divine will. It is good because it is before Him.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
παντα μοι πα ϋπο του πατροϲ μου και ου γινωϲκει τιϲ ε ο ει μη ο πα και τιϲ εϲτιν ο πατηρ ει μη ο και ω εαν βουλη ο αποκαλυ

**English Translation**
All things to me were del[ivered] by my Father; and no one knows who i[s] the [Son] except the Fa[ther], and who is the Father except the [Son], and to whomsoever the [Son] wills to revea[l].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the hammer against the Arians. "All things" are delivered to the Son. The knowledge is reciprocal and exclusive. Only the Father knows the Son (*ο*); only the Son knows the Father (*πα*). If the Son were a creature, He could not fully comprehend the Infinite Father. But He does know Him. Therefore, He is of the same substance. The revelation (*αποκαλυ*) depends entirely on the will (*βουλη*) of the Son, proving His sovereignty.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και ϲτραφειϲ προϲ τουϲ μαθη κατ ϊδιαν ειπ ειπ μακαριοι οι οφθαλ οι βλεποντεϲ α βλεπετε

**English Translation**
And turning to the discip[les] privately he sai[d] sai[d]: Blessed [are] the eye[s] seeing what ye see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The privacy of this beatitude is vital. He turns to the disciples *κατ ϊδιαν*. This is not for the crowds who seek bread, but for the faithful who seek the Face. The scribe again doubles the verb *ειπ ειπ* ("said said"), marking the solemnity. The "eyes" (*οφθαλ*) are blessed not because they are sharp, but because the Object of their sight is the Incarnate Word. To see Christ is the beatific vision begun on earth.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
λεγω γαρ ϋμιν οτι πολ προφηται και βαϲιλειϲ ηθεληϲ ηθεληϲ ειδειν α ϋμειϲ βλε και ουκ ϊδ και ακουϲαι α ακου και ουκ ηκου

**English Translation**
For I say to you that man[y] prophets and kings desire[d] desire[d] to see what ye se[e], and saw not; and to hear what ye hea[r], and heard not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The history of Israel was a long waiting. Kings and Prophets—David, Isaiah, Hezekiah—they *ηθεληϲ ηθεληϲ* ("desired desired"). The doubling of the verb cries out with the ache of the Old Covenant. They saw shadows; you see the Substance. They heard echoes; you hear the Voice. Do not squander, O monk, O virgin, O believer, the privilege that Solomon lacked. You possess the Reality they only dreamed of.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου νομικοϲ τιϲ ανεϲτη εκπι αυτον λε διδαϲκαλε τι ποιηϲαϲ ϊνα ζω αιωνιον κλη

**English Translation**
And behold, a certain lawyer stood up [tempting] him [saying], Teacher, having done what, that [life] eternal [I might inher...]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the posture of the challenger: he stands (*aneste*) not to honor, but to entrap. The scribe here abbreviates the malice, writing *ekpi* for *ekpeirazon* (tempting), and *le* for *legon* (saying). The lawyer asks about the inheritance (*kle*—truncated from *kleronomeso*) of eternal life, yet his heart is far from the humility required to receive it. He seeks a transaction ("having done what") rather than a transformation.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν προϲ αυτον εν τω νομω τι γεγραπται πωϲ α

**English Translation**
But he said to him, In the law what has been written? How [do you re...]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord refers the lawyer to his own profession. The text abruptly ends with *pos a*—surely *pos anaginoskeis* (how do you read). The alpha alone remains, the beginning of the act of reading. The Lord does not give a new commandment but illuminates the old, forcing the legalist to look into the mirror of the Law.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ειπ ειπ αγαπηϲειϲ τ ϲου εξ οληϲ τηϲ καρδιαϲ ϲου και ε ολη τη ψυχη ϲου και εν ολη τη ϊϲχυ ϲου και εν ολη τη διανοια ϲου και τον πληϲιον ϲου ωϲ ϲεαυτον

**English Translation**
And answering he said said, You shall love [the ?] of yours from your whole heart, and [in] your whole soul, and in your whole strength, and in your whole mind; and your neighbor as yourself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stammers, writing "said" (*eip*) twice, perhaps trembling at the magnitude of the command. Note the omission: "You shall love *[the Lord God]* of yours" is truncated to merely "the... of yours" (*t sou*). Yet the fourfold seat of devotion remains: heart, soul, strength, and mind. The scribe misses the Divine Name, yet preserves the total demand upon the human faculties.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ειπ ειπ δε αυτω ορθωϲ απεκριθηϲ τουτο ποιει και ζηϲη

**English Translation**
He said said but to him, Rightly you answered; this do and you shall live.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again the text stutters (*eip eip*). The Lord affirms the orthodoxy of the answer (*orthos*) but pivots immediately to orthopraxy (*touto poiei*—this do). Knowledge of the law brings no life without the enactment of love. The promise is life (*zese*), contrasting the lawyer's theoretical question with a vital imperative.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ο δε θελων δικαι αυτον εαυτον εαυτον ειπ ειπ προϲ τον και τιϲ εϲτιν μου πλη

**English Translation**
But he, willing to just[ify] him[self] himself himself, said said to the [Jesus?], And who is my neigh[bor]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the profound struggle in the text! The scribe writes *auton heauton heauton*—"himself himself himself." The lawyer is consumed by the self; he wishes to justify the self, and the manuscript mechanically echoes this egoism. He asks "Who is my *ple*..." (neighbor), seeking to draw a circle of exclusion. He desires a limit to love.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ϋπολαβων δε ο ειπεν α α τιϲ κατεβαινεν απο ϊερουϲαλημ ϊερε̣ι̣χ̣ω̣ ϊϲ εϊϲ ειεριχω και λη περιεπεϲ περιεπεϲ οι και εκδυϲαντεϲ αυτον και πληγαϲ επιθεντεϲ απηλ αφεντεϲ η

**English Translation**
But replying the [Lord] said, A man man certain was going down from Jerusalem [to] Jericho into Jericho, and fell among fell among rob[bers], who both having stripped him and having laid on blows, depart[ed] leaving [h...].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is rugged, full of repetitions (*man man*, *Jericho into Jericho*, *fell among fell among*). This reflects the chaos of the fall. The man descends from the City of Peace (Jerusalem) to the profane city (Jericho). He falls among *le* (*lestais*—robbers), who are the demons stripping man of his garment of immortality. He is left half-dead (*h*—truncated *hemi-thane*), alive to pain but dead to grace.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
κατα ϲυγ δε ϊερευϲ τιϲ κατεβαινεν εν τη οδω εκει και ϊδων αυ αντιπαρηλθ

**English Translation**
By chan[ce] but a certain priest was going down in that way, and seeing hi[m] passed by opposite.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
It was by *syn* (*synkyrian*—coincidence), not providence, that the priest appeared. He represents the Levitical Law, which sees the wound (*idon*) but lacks the power to heal it. He passes *antiparelth*—on the opposite side. The Law stands opposite to fallen man, accusing him but unable to bridge the gap of sin.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ομοιωϲ δε και λευϊτηϲ κατα τον το ελθων και ϊδων αντιπαρηλθεν

**English Translation**
Likewise but also a Levite, coming at the pla[ce], and seeing, passed by opposite.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Levite, the servant of the temple, imitates the priest. He comes "at the place" (*kata ton to*), sees the wreckage of humanity, and also passes opposite. Ritual purity cannot touch death without being defiled; thus, the old dispensation must keep its distance from the dying Adam.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ϲαμαριτηϲ δε τιϲ οδευων ηλθεν κατ αυτον και ϊδ εϲπλαγχνιϲθη

**English Translation**
But a certain Samaritan journeying came upon him, and see[ing] was moved with compassion.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Christ, called a Samaritan (a stranger/heretic) by the Jews. He is "journeying"—he has descended from heaven. Upon seeing (*id*), he is *esplanchnisthe*—his bowels turn with mercy. This is not mere pity; it is a visceral identification with the sufferer. Where the Law kept its distance, Grace draws near.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων κατεδηϲεν τα τραυματα αυτου επιχεων ελε και οινον επιβι δε αυτον ε το ϊδιον κτηνοϲ ηγαγεν αυτον ειϲ πανδοκιον πανδοχιον και επεμεληθη αυτου

**English Translation**
And approaching he bound up his wounds, pouring on oi[l] and wine; but putting him o[n] the own beast, he led him into an inn inn, and took care of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The medicines of the Church: oil (*ele*) for the soothing of mercy, wine for the sting of judgment and cleansing. He places the fallen man on his "own beast"—Christ bears our sins in his own body. He brings him to the *pandochion* (the inn), which the scribe corrects in spelling, emphasizing it as the place that "receives all." The Church is the hospital for the half-dead.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και επι τ τ αυριον εκβαλ δυο δηναρια εδω τω πανδοκει πανδοχει και ειπεν αυτω επιμεληθητι αυ και ο τι αν προϲ εν τω επανερχεϲθε επανερχεϲθαι με αποδωϲω ϲοι

**English Translation**
And on the the morrow, casting out two denarii, he gave to the innkeeper innkeeper and said to him, Take care of hi[m]; and whatever you spend in addi[tion], in the return return of me, I will repay you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "morrow" is the age of the Church after the Resurrection. The two denarii are the two Testaments, given to the *pandochei* (innkeeper/apostles) to sustain the faithful. The scribe stumbles over "return" (*epanerchesthai*), repeating the hope of the Second Coming. The Lord promises a full repayment; our labor in the Church is on credit until He returns.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
τιϲ τουτων των των τριων πληϲιον δοκει ϲοι γεγονεναι του εμπεϲοντοϲ ειϲ τουϲ ληϲταϲ

**English Translation**
Who of these of the the three neighbor seems to you to have become of the one falling into the robbers?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord inverts the lawyer's question. It is no longer "Who is my neighbor?" (whom must I love?), but "Who *became* (*gegonenai*) a neighbor?" Neighborliness is not a static definition but a dynamic action. Of the three (*trion*), only the one who showed mercy exists truly. The scribe's repetition of "of the" (*ton ton*) underscores the specificity of the choice.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ο ποιηϲαϲ το ελεοϲ μετ αυτου ειπεν δε αυτω ο πορευου και ϲοι ποιει ομοιωϲ

**English Translation**
And he said, "The one having done the mercy with him." And the [Lord] said to him, "Go, and you do likewise."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the definition of the neighbor: it is not defined by proximity of blood, but by the efficacy of mercy (`το ελεοϲ`). The lawyer is compelled by Truth to confess that kinship is found in action (`ο ποιηϲαϲ`, the one having done). The text here presents a stark command: `πορευου` (go/proceed). The scribe has left the subject `ο` (the [One]) hanging before the command, indicating the Lord's authority is the source of this mandate. We are not merely to admire the Samaritan but to duplicate his motion; the command is `ποιει` (do/make), present imperative, implying a continuous habit of mercy, not a singular act.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
εν δε τω πορευεϲθαι αυτουϲ αυτοϲ ειϲηλ ειϲ κωμην τινα γυνη δε τιϲ ονομα μαρθα ϋπεδε αυτον ειϲ την οικιαν αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
Now in their proceeding, he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman, by name Martha, received him into her house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord moves from the parable of the road to the reality of the village (`κωμην`). Note the specific agency of the woman: Martha `ϋπεδε` (received/welcomed under her roof) the Word. The Codex specifies `ειϲ την οικιαν αυτηϲ` (into *her* house), affirming her authority and possession of the dwelling. It is a mystery of grace that He who contains the heavens consents to be contained within the house of a servant. She offers hospitality to the Creator, unaware that He brings the bread of life to her table.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και αι τηδε ην αδελφη καλουμενη μα η και παρακα προϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ του η ηκουεν τον λογον αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And to this one was a sister called Mary, who also, having sat beside at the feet of the [Jesus], was hearing his word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the posture of discipleship. The text uses `παρακα` (for *parakathestheisa*), indicating she sat *beside* and *down*, a position of humility and stasis. She is anchored `προϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ` (at the feet) of the Lord (`του η`, abbreviated *Iesou*). While Martha opens the house, Mary opens the ear. The imperfect tense `ηκουεν` (was hearing) suggests a continuous, unbroken drinking in of the `λογον` (word/Logos). She does not merely hear a sound; she attends to the very structure of Truth proceeding from the Master.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
η δε μαρ περιεϲπατο πε πολλην διακο επιϲταϲα δε ειπεν ου μελι ϲοι ο η αδελφη μου μονην με κατε διακονιν ειπε ουν αυτη ϊ μοι ϲυναντι

**English Translation**
But Martha was being drawn about concerning much service; and standing by she said, "Does it not care to you that my sister left me alone to serve? Speak therefore to her that she might help me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Greek `περιεϲπατο` is vivid; she is "drawn around," distracted, pulled in opposing directions by the `πολλην διακο` (much service/diakonia). Her service, though noble, has become a source of fragmentation. She confronts the Lord with a question of care (`ου μελι ϲοι`, does it not concern you?), projecting her internal anxiety onto the Divine peace. She seeks to make the Lord an enforcer of her will (`ειπε ουν αυτη`, speak therefore to her), attempting to drag the contemplative soul back into the whirlwind of temporal anxiety. She feels `μονην` (alone), for toil without the vision of God is always solitary.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ει αυτη ο μαρθα μαρθα με και θορυ περι πολλα

**English Translation**
But answering, the [Lord] said to her, "Martha, Martha, [you are anxious] and troubled about many things."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of the name, "Martha, Martha," is the sign of a physician diagnosing a fever with tenderness. The Codex preserves the reading `θορυ` (for *thorybazê*), meaning she is making a tumult or noise within her soul. The root of her error is not her service, but her fragmentation `περι πολλα` (about many things). The "many" stands in opposition to the "One." When the soul is scattered among the manifold cares of this age, it loses the integration found only in the singular focus of the Logos.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
ολιγων δε εϲτ χρια η ενοϲ μαρια γαρ την αγαθην μερι εξελεξατο ητιϲ ουκ αφερεθηϲε απ αυτηϲ ·

**English Translation**
But of few things is there need, or of one; for Mary chose the good portion, which shall not be taken away from her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the distinct reading of our Codex: `ολιγων δε εϲτ χρια η ενοϲ` (of few things is there need, or of one). The Lord contracts the "many" of Martha first to "few," and finally to the singular "one" (`ενοϲ`). This is the ascent of the soul from the multiplicity of creation to the unity of the Creator. Mary has engaged her will—`εξελεξατο` (she chose)—to grasp this unity. It is called the `αγαθην μερι` (good portion/part). Unlike the meal Martha prepares, which is consumed and vanishes, this portion is eternal; `ουκ αφερεθηϲε` (it shall not be taken away). The service of the hands passes; the contemplation of the Word endures.
