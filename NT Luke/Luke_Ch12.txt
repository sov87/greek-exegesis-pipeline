**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
εν οιϲ επιϲυ των μυ του οχλου ωϲτε καταπατειν αλληλουϲ ηρξατο λεγειν προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου πρωτον προϲεχετε εαυτοιϲ απο τηϲ ζυμηϲ τ τ φαριϲαιων ητιϲ ε ϋποκριϲιϲ ˙

**English Translation**
In which [time], the myriads of the crowd having gathered together so as to trample one another, he began to say to his disciples first: Take heed to yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrifying density of the *myriads* (μυ)—a numberless, crushing weight of humanity, desperate for the flesh but ignorant of the spirit. Yet, amidst this chaotic trampling, the Lord turns *first* to the few, His disciples. He warns not of the crowd's violence, but of the Pharisees' infection. He calls it *leaven* (ζυμηϲ): an agent that is silent, hidden, yet permeates the whole loaf. Hypocrisy is not merely a lie spoken; it is a corruption of substance. The text stammers here ("τ τ" for "of the"), as if to hesitate before naming this insidious vice.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ουδεν κεκαλυμ εϲτιν ο ουκ αποκαλυφθη ˙ και κρυπτ ο ου γνωϲθηϲε ˙

**English Translation**
Nothing is covered which will not be revealed; and hidden which will not be known.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates "covered" (κεκαλυμ) and "hidden" (κρυπτ), yet the meaning is full. Here is the eschatological terror for the hypocrite and the consolation for the just. The Pharisees rely on the "covering"—the outward show of piety over the inward rot. But the Lord declares a future where all veils are torn. There is no secret place in the universe of God; all "hidden" things are destined for the light of judgment.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ανθ ων οϲα εν τη ϲκοτια ειπατε τω φωτι ακουϲ και ο προϲ το ουϲ ελαληϲατε τοιϲ ταμιοιϲ κηρυ επι τ δωματων ·

**English Translation**
Because as many things as you said in the darkness, in the light [it] will be heard; and what you spoke to the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the housetops.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *tamieion* (inner room) is the place of storage and privacy, where men think their whispers die. But the acoustics of God’s kingdom are inverted. The whisper in the dark becomes a shout in the light. The scribe writes "κηρυ" (proclaimed) with force: the Gospel, and the judgment of our secrets, belongs to the open air, upon the "housetops." We must live as if the walls have fallen down.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
λεγω δε τοιϲ φι μου · μη φο απο των αποκτεννοντ το ϲωμα · και με αυτα μετα ταυτα μη εχοντ περιϲϲοτερον τι ποιηϲαι

**English Translation**
But I say to my friends: Do not fear those killing the body; and after these things, not having anything more abundant to do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A tender distinction: He speaks to His *friends* (φι). The world offers violence, abbreviated here as "killing" (αποκτεννοντ), but its power is strictly limited. The tyrant can destroy the vessel of clay (the body), but there his jurisdiction ends abruptly. "Not having anything more abundant to do"—what a mockery of worldly power! Once the body is dead, the persecutor stands impotent, his weapons useless against the liberated soul.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
ϋποδι τινα φο τον με το αποκτειναι εχοντα εξουϲι εμβαλλειν ειϲ τ τ γεενναν ναι λεγω ϋμιν τουτον φο

**English Translation**
I will show [you] whom you should fear: The [one who] after the killing has authority to cast into Gehenna; yes, I say to you, fear this one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the realignment of the heart's trembling. We fear the sword, but we ought to fear the sentence. The text stutters "τ τ" before *Gehenna*, emphasizing the specific, terrible reality of that place. Only God has the *exousia* (authority) that extends beyond the grave. To fear God is to be liberated from the fear of men; to fear men is to risk the fire that does not consume the body, but the soul.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ουχι π ϲτρουθια πωλο πωλο αϲϲαριων δυο και εν εξ αυτων ουκ εϲτιν επιλε ενω του

**English Translation**
Are not five sparrows sold [sold] for two assaria? And one of them is not forgotten before God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes "π" for five and repeats "sold" (πωλο πωλο), perhaps an error, or perhaps emphasizing the cheapness of the transaction in the market. Five birds for two small coins—life valued at nearly nothing. Yet, the divine memory is perfect. "Not forgotten before God" (ενω του). If the Creator holds the memory of a single sparrow sold for a fraction of a copper, how much more does He hold the memory of His martyrs?

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
αλλα και αι τριχεϲ τηϲ κεφαληϲ ϋμων παϲαι ηριθμην μη ουν φοβει πολλων ϲτρου διαφερετε διαφερεται

**English Translation**
But even the hairs of your head have all been numbered. Therefore do not fear; you differ [differ] from many sparrows.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The intimacy of Providence extends to the trivial; the very hairs are "numbered" (ηριθμην). God is not merely a general overseer but a particular lover of His creation. The text repeats "differ" (διαφερετε διαφερεται) with a spelling shift, reinforcing the immense ontological gap between the bird and the believer. You are of a different substance, a different worth. Fear is banished by value.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λεγω δε ϋμιν οτι παϲ οϲ αν ομολο εν εμοι εμ των αν και ο του ανθρωπου ο εν αυ εμπροϲθεν των αγγελων του

**English Translation**
But I say to you, that everyone whoever confesses in me before men, also the Son of Man will confess in him before the angels of God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The law of reciprocity. To confess "in me" (εν εμοι)—note the preposition, implying union, not just speech—before the tribunal of men leads to a glorious counter-confession. The Son of Man (abbreviated typically as <em>humanity</em>, yet acting as Judge) stands before the angelic court and claims the faithful one as His own. The earthly courtroom is a shadow; the angelic courtroom is the reality.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ο δε αρνηϲαμενοϲ με ενωπιον τ τ ανθρωπων · απαρ απαρνηθηϲεται ενωπι των αγγελ αγγελ του

**English Translation**
But the one having denied me before men; will be denied [denied] before the angels [angels] of God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is agitated, repeating "the" (τ τ), repeating "denied" (απαρ απαρνηθηϲεται), and repeating "angels" (αγγελ αγγελ). It is as if the text itself trembles at the horror of apostasy. The denial on earth echoes violently in heaven. To be disowned by the Truth before the hosts of heaven is the ultimate undoing of the human creature.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και παϲ οϲ αι λογον ειϲ τον ϋϊον του ανθρω αφεθηϲεται αυτω τω δε ειϲ το αγιον π π βλαϲ ουκ α

**English Translation**
And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but to the one having blasphemed against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful mystery. One may speak against the Son in His veiled humanity and find mercy. But to blaspheme the *Holy Spirit* (π π)—the very agent of grace, the breath of life, the illuminator of truth—is to reject the remedy itself. The scribe abbreviates "not forgiven" (ουκ α), cutting the sentence short, just as the blasphemer is cut off from the stream of divine mercy. It is the sin of final, obstinate rejection of the Light.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
οταν δε ειϲφερωϲιν ϋμαϲ ειϲ ταϲ ϲυνα και ταϲ αρ και ταϲ εξου μη μεριμνη πωϲ η τι απο η τι ειπητε

**English Translation**
But whenever they bring you into the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry how or what you should answer or what you should say.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord prepares them for the forensic trial. He lists the venues: religious courts (synagogues) and secular powers (rulers/authorities). The command is against *merimna* (anxiety/worry). The disciple is not to prepare a rhetorical defense (apologia) as the sophists do. The defense of the faith is not a product of human wit or prepared speeches.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
το γαρ αγι π π διδαξει ϋμαϲ εν αυτη τη ωρα α δει ειπειν

**English Translation**
For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what things it is necessary to say.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the reason for the lack of worry: The Advocate is present. The text emphasizes the *Holy Spirit* (αγι π π) as the active Teacher. The inspiration is immediate—"in that very hour." The martyr does not speak *for* God; God speaks *through* the martyr. The "necessary" (δει) words are supplied by the Divine Breath, turning the prisoner's dock into a pulpit of revelation.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε τιϲ εκ του οχλου αυτω διδαϲκαλε ειπε τω αδελφω μου μεριϲαϲθε μετ ε την κληρο

**English Translation**
And a certain one from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, speak to my brother to divide with me the inheritance."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the intrusion of the mundane into the divine. While the Lord teaches the mysteries of the Spirit, a man from the *ochlos* (crowd) sees only a Magistrate for his earthly disputes. He demands a division (*merisasthe*), a tearing apart of assets, whereas Christ comes to gather into one. The petitioner seeks the *klero* (inheritance) of dust, blind to the eternal inheritance being offered in the very presence of the Word.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω ανθρωπε τιϲ με κατεϲτηϲεν κρι η μεριϲτην εφ υμων υμαϲ

**English Translation**
But He said to him, "Man, who appointed Me a judge or a divider over you?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The address *anthrope* (Man) is not affectionate but reproving, distancing the divine nature from human squabbles. The Lord rejects the office of *meristen* (divider). His judgment is of the heart, not the coin. By asking "who appointed Me," He reveals that His mandate from the Father is to save souls, not to arbitrate the petty greed of siblings. He refuses to descend from the height of Savior to the lowliness of a probate lawyer.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυτουϲ ο και φυλαϲϲε απο παϲηϲ πλεονεξιαϲ οτι ουκ εν τω περιϲ τινι η ζω αυτου εϲτιν εκ των αυτου αυτω ˙

**English Translation**
And He said to them, "Watch and guard [yourselves] from all covetousness, because his life is not in the abounding to anyone from his possessions."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord strikes at the root: *pleonexias* (covetousness/greed), the desire for "more." The text strictly warns that *zoe* (life) does not exist *en to peris* (in the surplus). The syntax here, though rugged, conveys a profound ontological truth: being is not derived from having. The man who thinks his existence is secured by the things *ek ton autou* (from his own) is deceived; life is a gift of the Spirit, not a byproduct of accumulation.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε παραβολην προϲ αυτουϲ λεγων · ανθρωπου τινοϲ πλουϲιου ευφορη η χωρα

**English Translation**
And He spoke a parable to them, saying: "The land of a certain rich man bore well."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note that the wealth comes from the *chora* (the land/country), which is God’s creation. The man is merely the recipient of this *euphore* (good bearing/fertility). The miracle of growth happens without his command, yet we shall see he appropriates the divine bounty solely for his own glory. The abundance was a test of stewardship, but the rich man perceives it only as a validation of his ownership.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και δι εν εαυ λεγων τι ποι οτι ουκ εχω που ϲυναξω τουϲ καρπουϲ μου ˙

**English Translation**
And he reasoned in himself, saying, "What shall I do, because I do not have where I will gather my fruits?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The dialogue is *en eau* (in himself); he has no friends, no poor neighbors to consult, only his own ego. His dilemma is spatial, not spiritual: "I do not have where." He calls the harvest *tous karpous mou* (my fruits), forgetting they are gifts from the earth. He is imprisoned by his own possession, anxious because the blessing has become a burden to his selfishness.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν τουτο ποι καθελω μου ταϲ αποθηκαϲ κ(αι) μειζοναϲ ανοι οικοδομηϲω και ϲυναξω εκει παν τα γενηματα μου τον ϲιτον μ(ου) κ(αι) τα αγαθα μου παντα τον ϲιτον μ(ου) κ(αι) τα αγαθα μου

**English Translation**
And he said, "This I will do: I will pull down my barns and I will build greater ones, and I will gather there all my produce, my grain and my goods, all my grain and my goods."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe’s repetition—*my grain and my goods, all my grain and my goods*—perfectly captures the obsessive madness of the hoarder. He speaks of destruction (*kathelo*, pull down) in order to build (*oikodomeso*), a futile labor for a transient life. He plans to store *panta* (all) things, leaving nothing for the hungry. His "goods" (*agatha*) are merely physical wheat; he has no store of good works.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και ερω τη ψυχη μου ψυχη εχειϲ πολλα αγαθα κει ειϲ ετη πολ αναπαυου φα πιε ευφρενου

**English Translation**
And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many good things lying [stored] for many years; rest, eat, drink, be merry."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the height of folly: he addresses his *psyche* (soul) as if it were a belly. Can a soul eat wheat? Can a spirit drink wine? He promises himself *ete pol* (many years), usurping the prerogative of God who alone holds time. He commands his soul to *anapauou* (rest) in sloth, confusing the peace of God with the idleness of satiety.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτω ο αφρων ταυτη τη νυκτι την ψυ ϲου απαιτου απο ϲου α δε ητοιμαϲαϲ τινι εϲται

**English Translation**
But [God] said to him, "Fool, on this night they demand your soul from you; and the things you prepared, to whom will they be?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine verdict is swift. He is named *aphron* (mindless/fool). The verb *apaitou* (they demand) suggests a terrifying reality: his life was a loan, and now the creditors (perhaps the angels of judgment) are calling it in. The question "to whom will they be?" mocks his anxiety about inheritance. He gathered for himself, but strangers shall scatter it. The night of death exposes the poverty of his soul.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ ο θη αυτω εαυτω και μη ειϲ πλου ·

**English Translation**
Thus is the one storing up for himself and not being rich toward [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is stark: *the[saurizon] auto* (treasuring for himself) is the path to ruin. The sentence breaks abruptly at *eis plou* (toward rich/wealth), implying the target of true wealth—God—is the only valid direction. To be rich in barns is to be a beggar in the Kingdom. The "Thus" (*outos*) seals the fate of all who imitate the fool: solitary accumulation ends in eternal loss.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ τουϲ μαθη αυτου δια του λεγω ϋμιν μη μεριμναται τη ψυχη τι φαγητε μηδε τω ϲωματι τι ενδυϲηϲθε

**English Translation**
And He said to His disciples, "On account of this I say to you: Do not be anxious for the soul, what you shall eat, nor for the body, what you shall put on."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Turning to the *mathetas* (disciples), the Lord moves from the sin of greed to the sin of *merimna* (anxiety). The fool hoarded because he feared the future; the disciple must not fear, for he trusts the Father. The prohibition is against anxiety regarding the *psyche* (life) and *somati* (body). To worry is to act as if God does not exist or does not care.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
η γαρ ψυχη πλειον εϲ εϲτιν τηϲ τροφηϲ και το ϲωμα του εν

**English Translation**
For the soul is more than the food, and the body than the clothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fundamental hierarchy of value. The *psyche* is the jewel; food is merely the setting. The scribe’s stutter (*es estin*) emphasizes the reality: the soul *is, is* truly greater. If God created the greater (the life), will He not provide the lesser (the sustenance)? Anxiety inverts this order, obsessing over the fuel while neglecting the engine of life.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
κατανο τουϲ κορα οτι ουτε ϲπι ουτε θερι οιϲ ουκ ε ταμιον ου αποθηκη και ο τρεφει αυτουϲ ποϲω μαλλον ϋ διαφερετε των πετινων

**English Translation**
Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; to whom there is not a storehouse nor a barn, and [God] feeds them; how much more do you differ from the birds?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He points to the *korakas* (ravens), birds considered unclean by the Law, yet sustained by Grace. They have no *apotheke* (barn)—the very thing the rich fool built—yet they do not starve. If the Creator feeds the unclean ravens who neither sow nor reap, *poso mallon* (how much more) will He feed His own children? The difference (*diapherete*) between a man and a bird is the measure of God's specific care for you.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
τιϲ δε εξ υμων με δυναται προϲθειναι επι την ηλικιαν αυ πηχυν ενα

**English Translation**
But who of you [by being anxious] is able to add upon his stature one cubit?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the futility of the human will when severed from Divine Providence. The text asks `τιϲ` (who?), implying that no mortal power suffices for even the slightest augmentation of our nature. The scribe’s abbreviation `με` stands for the anxiety (`μεριμνων`) that consumes the soul; yet this anxiety is sterile. It cannot add a "cubit"—a measure of the body—to our `ηλικιαν` (stature or lifespan). If we cannot govern the length of our days or the height of our frame, how much less can we govern the tides of fortune?

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν ουδε ελαχιϲτον τι δυναϲθαι · τι περι των λοιπων με

**English Translation**
If therefore you are not able [to do] even the least thing, why concerning the rest do you [worry]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The argument proceeds *a minori ad maius*. The "least thing" (`ελαχιϲτον`) is the preservation of one's own physical dimension, which we falsely believe we control. If this biological fundamental is beyond our `δυναϲθαι` (power), then the "rest" (`των λοιπων`)—food, clothing, the future—is certainly outside our jurisdiction. The Bishop admonishes: to worry is to usurp the role of God, a usurpation that fails immediately upon the test of the smallest matter.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
κατανο τα κρινα πωϲ αυξανι ου κο ουδε νηθει · λεγω δε οτι ουδε ϲολομων εν παϲη τη δοξη αυτου περιεβαλε ωϲ εν τουτ τουτ

**English Translation**
Consider the lilies how they grow; they do not [toil] nor spin; but I say that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one [of these].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We are commanded to `κατανο` (consider/perceive) creation. The lily `αυξανι` (grows) without the sweat of the curse (`ου κο` - no toil). Here is a rebuke to human vanity: Solomon, the apex of kingly wealth and artificial construction, cannot rival the effortless grace of a single flower (`εν τουτ`). The repetition in the manuscript `τουτ τουτ` (of these, of these) emphasizes the singular perfection of the humblest creation over the greatest human fabrication.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ϊ δε εν αγρω τον χορτον οντα ϲη και αυρι αυρι ειϲ κλιβανον βαλ ο ου αμφιεννυϲ αμφιεννυϲ ποϲω μαλλον ϋ ολιγοπιϲτοι

**English Translation**
But if in the field the grass being [here] today, and [tomorrow] is thrown into the oven, [God] clothes [it thus], how much more you, O little-faiths?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The transience of the material world is stark: the grass exists `ϲη` (today) only to be fuel for the `κλιβανον` (oven) tomorrow. The scribal doubling `αυρι αυρι` (tomorrow tomorrow) and `αμφιεννυϲ αμφιεννυϲ` (clothes clothes) in this Codex serves to heighten the urgency: the grass is so fleeting, yet God’s clothing of it is so sure. The rebuke `ολιγοπιϲτοι` (little-faiths) strikes the conscience; if God adorns the fuel of a fire, will He not adorn the temples of the Holy Spirit?

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και ϋμειϲ μη ζητειτε τι φαγητε και τι πι μηδε τω ϲω και μη μετε

**English Translation**
And you, do not seek what you might eat and what you might [drink], nor [for the body] and do not be [anxious].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prohibition is absolute: `μη ζητειτε` (do not seek). The text here is rugged (`τι πι` for drink, `τω ϲω` likely for the body, `μη μετε` for anxiety), reflecting the fragmented nature of earthly concerns. We are told not to be suspended in mid-air (`μετεωριζεσθε`, implied by `μετε`), wavering between hope and fear. To seek the material as a primary end is to deny the spiritual reality of the Father's provision.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα γαρ παντα τα εθνη του κοϲμου επι ϋμων δε ο πατηρ οιδεν ο χρηζετε τουτ

**English Translation**
For all these things the nations of the world [seek after]; but your Father knows that you have need [of these].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sharp boundary is drawn between the Church and `τα εθνη` (the nations/pagans). Anxiety is the liturgy of the heathen, who believe they must manipulate the gods for survival. For the faithful, the relationship is filial: `ο πατηρ οιδεν` (the Father knows). Knowledge precedes the request. We do not inform God of our needs; we rest in His antecedent omniscience.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
πλην ζητειτε τ βαϲιλειαν αυτου και ταυτα παντα προϲτε ϋμιν

**English Translation**
However, seek His Kingdom, and all these things shall be added to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Great Exchange. The particle `πλην` (however/but) redirects the will. The object of the Christian search is singular: `τ βαϲιλειαν` (the Kingdom). The promise `προϲτε` (shall be added) implies that earthly goods are merely the baggage, not the destination. He who seeks the King gets the crumbs from the King's table, which suffice for life; he who seeks the crumbs loses both King and table.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
μη φοβου το μικρον ποιμνιον οτι ευ ϋμων ο πατηρ δουναι την βαϲιλει

**English Translation**
Do not fear, little flock, because your Father [was well pleased] to give you the Kingdom.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pastoral tenderness flows here. The Church is a `μικρον ποιμνιον` (little flock), defenseless and outnumbered. Yet, fear is banished not by our strength, but by the Father's `ευ` (good pleasure). The Kingdom is not a wage earned by the anxious, but a gift (`δουναι`) bestowed by the Father. The security of the flock rests entirely on the immutable will of the Shepherd.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
πωληϲατε τα ϋπαρχοντα ϋμ ϋμ και δοτε ελεημο ποιηϲατε εαυτοιϲ βαλλαντι μη παλαιουμε θηϲαυρον α εν τοιϲ ουρανοιϲ οπου κλεπτηϲ ουκ εν ουδε ϲηϲ δια

**English Translation**
Sell your possessions and give [alms]; make for yourselves purses not growing old, a treasure [unfailing] in the heavens, where thief is not [near] nor moth [destroys].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is radical dispossession. The repetition `ϋμ ϋμ` (your your) emphasizes that these possessions are truly yours to give away. We exchange `ϋπαρχοντα` (existing things) for `ελεημο` (mercy/alms). The earthly purse is `παλαιουμε` (aging/decaying), but the heavenly treasure is `α` (unfailing/indestructible). The security of heaven is defined by negation: no thief, no moth. It is the fortress of God.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
οπου γαρ εϲτιν ο θηϲαυροϲ ϋμων εκει και η καρδια εϲται

**English Translation**
For where your treasure is, there also the heart will be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the spiritual law of gravity. The `καρδια` (heart)—the center of will and intellect—is not autonomous; it is enslaved to what it values. If the treasure is dust, the heart eats dust. If the treasure is celestial, the heart ascends. We do not move our treasure to suit our hearts; we move our treasure to relocate our hearts to God.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
εϲτωϲαν ϋμων αι οϲφυεϲ περιε και οι λυχνοι καιομε

**English Translation**
Let your loins be [girded] and the lamps [burning].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The posture of the Christian is one of perpetual readiness. `οϲφυεϲ περιε` (loins girded) recalls the Exodus—ready to march, ready to work, unencumbered by flowing robes of leisure. `λυχνοι καιομε` (lamps burning) signifies spiritual vigilance in the darkness of the present age. We are not permitted to sleep, for the night is advanced.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
και ϋμειϲ ο ανθρωποιϲ προϲδεχομενοιϲ τον εαυτων πο αναλυϲη εκ τ τ γαμων ϊνα ελθον και κρουϲαν ευθεωϲ ανοι αυτω

**English Translation**
And you [like] men waiting for their own [Master] when he returns from the marriage feasts; that [upon his] coming and knocking, immediately they might open to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We are servants in the antechamber of eternity. The Master (`πο`, implied Lord) is at the `γαμων` (wedding feasts)—a symbol of divine joy—but our duty is the watch. The critical word is `ευθεωϲ` (immediately). There is no time to dress or trim lamps when the knock (`κρουϲαν`) comes. The delay of the Parousia is the testing of the servant's fidelity. We must be found at the door, hand upon the latch.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
μακαριοι οι δουλοι εκεινοι ουϲ ελθ ελθ ο ευρηϲει γρηγο αμην λε ϋμιν οτι περι και ανα αυτουϲ και παρελθων διακονηϲει αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] those slaves whom, [coming coming], the [Lord] shall find watch[ing]; Amen I s[ay] to you that [he will gird] and [recline] them, and having come alongside he will minister to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s trembling hand in the repetition *elth elth* ("coming coming"). It signifies the absolute certainty and the sudden urgency of the Parousia. The text abbreviates the Lord's actions—*peri* for girding, *ana* for reclining—as if the mystery of the Master serving the slave is too great to write in full. It is a reversal of the cosmic order: the Creator washes the creature. We must be found *gregorountas* (watching), even if the word itself is cut short in our weary flesh.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
κ κ εν τη δευτερα καν εν τη τριτη φυλακη ελθη και ευρη ου μακαριοι ειϲ εκεινοι εκεινοι

**English Translation**
A[nd] a[nd] in the second, and if in the third watch he comes and finds [so], blessed ar[e] those those.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers "and and" (*k k*) and doubles the demonstrative "those those" (*ekeini ekeini*). This doubling amplifies the beatitude. Whether in the "second watch" (the prime of life) or the "third" (the decline of age), the blessing belongs to those who persist. The word *outos* (thus/so) is truncated to *ou*, suggesting that the state of readiness is a silent, internal disposition known only to God.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
τουτο δε γινωϲκε οτι ει ηδει ο οι ποι ωρα ο κλεπτηϲ ερχεται εγρηγορηϲεν κ(αι) εγρηγορηϲεν αν κ(αι) ουκ αν α διορυχθη τον οικον αυτου

**English Translation**
But know this, that if the [householder] knew in what hour the thief comes, he watched a[nd] he watched [would], a[nd] not [would] [let] his house be dug through.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reads *o oi* for the householder, a stutter of identity; are we truly masters of our houses (our bodies), or merely tenants? The repetition *egregoresen kai egregoresen* ("he watched and he watched") emphasizes that vigilance cannot be a singular event but a perpetual state. The thief comes to "dig through" (*diorychthe*) the mud-brick walls of our mortality; the soul must not be found sleeping when the clay is breached.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και ϋμειϲ γι ετοιμοι ο η ωρα ου δοκειτε ο του ανθρωπου ερχεται ·

**English Translation**
And you, be[come] ready, [because] in the hour you do not think, the [Son] of Man comes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command *gi* is a sharp imperative for *ginesthe* ("become"). It is not enough to *be* ready; one must constantly *become* ready, a dynamic process of sanctification. The text omits *uios* (Son), reading simply "the of Man." This stark phrasing strips away titles to reveal the Judge in His humanity, coming at an hour that defies our *dokeite* (thinking/estimation).

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτω ο πετροϲ προϲ ημαϲ την πα ταυτην λεγειϲ η και προϲ πανταϲ

**English Translation**
But Peter said to him: To us do you speak this pa[rable] or also to all?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, representing the hierarchy, asks if the burden of the "pa[rable]" (*pa* for *parabolen*) falls upon the clergy ("us") or the laity ("all"). The abbreviation of "parable" suggests Peter's haste to know the limits of his liability. He fears the stricter judgment, and rightly so, for the shepherd answers for the sheep.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και ειπ ο τιϲ αρα εϲτιν ο πιϲτοϲ δουλοϲ οικονομοϲ και φρονιμοϲ ον κατεϲτηϲεν καταϲτηϲει ο επι τηϲ θε αυτου του διαδουναι διδοναι εν και το ϲιτομετρι ϲιτομετρι

**English Translation**
And the [Lord] s[aid]: Who then is the faithful slave, steward and wise, whom the [Lord] appointed [will appoint] over his ser[vice] to distribute [to give] in season the wheat-measure [wheat-measure]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is agitated with corrections: "appointed/will appoint," "distribute/give." This reflects the trembling uncertainty of the steward's tenure. Most profound is the double *sitometrion* ("wheat-measure wheat-measure"). The steward's primary duty is the dispensing of the grain—the Eucharist. The repetition emphasizes that this spiritual food must be given again and again, "in season," without fail.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
μακαριοϲ ο δουλοϲ εκεινοϲ ον ελθ ελθ ο αυτου ευρηϲει ουτωϲ ποιουντα

**English Translation**
Blessed [is] that slave whom, [coming coming], his [Lord] shall find doing thus.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Once more, the scribe writes *elth elth* ("coming coming"). The return is the heartbeat of the passage. The blessing is not for the slave found *standing*, but the slave found *doing* (*poiounta*). The "wheat-measure" must be in his hand when the Master appears. The omission of *kurios* (Lord) before *autou* assumes the Master is the only subject that matters.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
αληθωϲ λεγω ϋ οτι επι παϲιν τοιϲ αυτου καταϲτηϲει αυτον

**English Translation**
Truly I say to y[ou] that over all his [possessions] he will appoint him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reward for faithfulness in the "little" of the earthly church is authority over *pasin* ("all things") in the Kingdom. The text abbreviates *hymin* to *y*, directing the promise pointedly at the listener's heart. He who faithfully dispenses the grain of God shall be made ruler over the very treasury of Heaven.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
εαν δε ει ο δουλοϲ εκει εν τη καρδι αυτου χρονιζει μου ο ο μου μου ο κ ερχεϲ και αρξηται τυπτειν τουϲ παι και ταϲ πεδι εϲθιειν τε και πινειν και με

**English Translation**
But if that slave s[ays] in his hear[t]: Delays my the the my my the L[ord] to com[e], and begins to beat the b[oys] and the g[irls], to eat and to drink and to be dr[unk].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Greek here fractures into chaos: "my the the my my the Lord" (*mou o o mou mou o k*). This syntactical breakdown mirrors the drunken confusion of the wicked priest who forgets his Master. He claims the church as "my my." He abuses the *pai* and *pedi* (truncated *paidas* and *paidiskas*—the servants of God). His end is truncated too: *me* (for *methuskesthai*, to get drunk). Sin cuts life short.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ηξει ο του δουλου ε εν ημερα η ου προϲδοκα και εν ωρα η ου γινωϲκει και δι αυτ και το μεροϲ αυ μετα των απι θηϲει ·

**English Translation**
Will come the [Lord] of th[at] slave in a day which he does not expect and in an hour which he does not know, and will c[ut] hi[m] [in two], and the portion of hi[m] with the unfaith[ful] he will place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The violence of judgment is captured in the slashing of the words: *di aut* for *dichotomesei auton* (cut him in two). The unfaithful priest is bisected—separated from the grace of office, leaving only the man of dust. He is assigned a "portion" (*meros*) not with the saints, but with the *api* (unfaithful/unbelievers). The abbreviated text creates a sense of abrupt, terrifying finality.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
εκει δε ο δουλοϲ ο γνουϲ το θελη του αυτου και μη ετοιμαϲαϲ η ποιηϲαϲ προϲ το θελημα αυτου δαρηϲεται πολ

**English Translation**
But that slave, the one having known the wil[l] of his [Lord], and not having prepared or having done according to his will, shall be beaten with man[y].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Knowledge brings judgment. The slave who knew the *thele* (will) but failed to act faces *pol* (many [stripes]). The text abbreviates the punishment, perhaps out of mercy or horror. We who study the Scriptures and hold the office of Bishop "know the will." If we are negligent, our stripes will be far more numerous than the ignorant layman's.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
ο δε μη γνουϲ ποιηϲαϲ δε αξια πληγων δαρηϲε ολιγαϲ παντι δε δε ω εδοθη πολυ πολυ πολυ ζητηθηϲεται πα αυτου και ω παρε πολυ περιϲ αιτηϲου αυτον

**English Translation**
But the one not having known, but having done things worthy of stripes, shall be beat[en] with few. But to everyone [but but] to whom was given much much much, shall be sought from him; and to whom they comm[itted] much, mor[e] they will ask of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the triple weight: *poly poly poly* ("much much much"). The scribe repeats the word three times, emphasizing the terrifying magnitude of the grace entrusted to the priesthood. To whom "much much much" is given, the demand is absolute. The text stammers *panti de de* ("to everyone but but"), gasping under the burden. We are entrusted (*pare*) with the souls of men; from us, God will ask *peris* (more/excess). We must return the talent with interest, or face the fire.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
πυρ ηλθον βαλε επι την γην και τι θελω ει ηδη ανηφθη

**English Translation**
Fire I came to cast upon the earth, and what do I will if already it were kindled?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the urgency in the Lord’s voice. He speaks of *pyr* (fire), not as a destroyer of the faithful, but as the refining element of the Spirit and the consuming force of judgment. The text presents a compressed cry: *bale* (to cast) stands starkly. The Lord’s will (*thelō*) is framed by a conditional *ei* (if), suggesting a holy impatience; He desires the blaze of the Gospel to be already burning (*anēphthē*). We must not be tepid, for the Master brings a flame to the earth, and we are the fuel.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
βαπτι δε εχω βαπτι και πωϲ ϲυνεχομαι εωϲ οτου τελεϲθη ϲυντελεϲθη τελεϲθη

**English Translation**
But a baptism I have to be baptized [with], and how I am constrained until whatever [time] it be accomplished—completed—accomplished!

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Codex reveals the agony of the Christ through the very stumbling of the scribe. The word *bapti* (baptism) is truncated, and the fulfillment—*telesthe*—is written, corrected to *syntelesthe*, and written again as *telesthe*. This textual stutter mirrors the Lord’s distress (*synechomai*). He is hemmed in by the necessity of the Passion. This "baptism" is not of water, but of blood. The repetition of "accomplished" signifies that this suffering is the definitive end toward which all history rushes.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
δο οτι ειρηνην παρεγενομην δουναι εν τη γη ουχι λεγω αλλ η διαμεριϲμε διαμεριϲμ

**English Translation**
Do [you think] that peace I arrived to give in the earth? No, I tell [you], but rather division—division.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world expects the Messiah to bring an earthly tranquility, but He corrects this delusion. *Dokeite* (do you think) challenges our assumptions. The manuscript repeats the word *diamerisme* (division), emphasizing the severity of the schism. The Truth is a sword that severs the diseased limb from the body. We must not fear this division, for unity in error is damnation, while division for the sake of the Truth is the path to God.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
εϲονται γαρ απο του νυν πεντε εν ενι οικω διαμεμεριϲμενοι τρειϲ επι δυϲ και δυο επι τριϲιν

**English Translation**
For there shall be from the now five in one house having been divided: three against two, and two against three.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The household (*oikō*), the foundation of our Roman order, is fractured by the call of the Christ. The numbers are specific: five total, split into three and two. There is no neutrality. The perfect participle *diamemerismenoi* indicates a state of division that stands firm. Faith is not a hereditary inheritance; it is a personal election that may pit the few against the many within the same walls.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
διαμεριϲθηϲον πατηρ επι ϋϊω και επι πατρι και μητηρ επι θυ και θυγατηρ επι μητερα πεν επι την νυμ αυτηϲ και νυμφη επι την πενθερ αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
They shall be divided: father against son, and [son] against father; and mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her bride, and bride against her mother-in-law.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates the familial titles—*huiō* (son), *thu* (daughter), *pen* (mother-in-law), *num* (bride)—as if rushing through the catalogue of sorrow. The natural affection (*storgē*) is overturned by a higher loyalty. The conflict between the *pentheran* and the *nymphen* (bride/daughter-in-law) is particularly sharp, invading the domestic hierarchy. The Gospel rewrites the genealogy of the faithful, replacing bloodlines with lines of belief.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε και τοιϲ οχλοιϲ οταν ϊδη νεφελην ανα επι δυ ευθεωϲ λε οτι ομβροϲ ερχεται και γεινε ουτωϲ

**English Translation**
And he was saying also to the crowds: Whenever you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say that a shower comes, and it happens so.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord turns to the *ochlois* (crowds), the common people who know the earth. They watch the "west" (*dys*), the sea, for the rising cloud (*nephelēn*). They possess a natural wisdom, predicting the rain (*ombros*) with certainty (*ginetai houtōs*). Yet, this physical astuteness highlights their spiritual blindness. They read the sky but cannot read the Son of Man standing before them.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
και οτ νοτον πνεοντα λεγετε οτι καυϲων ε̣ρ̣ εϲται εϲται και γεινεται

**English Translation**
And when a south wind is blowing, you say that burning heat there shall be—shall be; and it happens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
From the west comes rain; from the south (*noton*), the desert wind brings *kausōn* (burning heat). The scribe stumbles again, repeating *estai* (shall be), reinforcing the confidence of the people in their predictions. They are prophets of the weather, sure of what "shall be," yet they are ignorant of the eternal climate that is shifting. They feel the wind on their skin but not the Spirit in their souls.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
ϋποκριται το προ τηϲ γηϲ κ(αι) του ουρανου του ουρανου κ(αι) τηϲ γηϲ οιδα δοκιμαζειν τον δε καιρον του πωϲ ουκ οιδα δοκιμαζειν

**English Translation**
Hypocrites! The face of the earth and of the heaven—of the heaven and of the earth—you know [how] to examine, but the time—this [time]—how do you not know [how] to examine?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusation is sharp: *Hypokritai*! The manuscript exhibits a curious repetition, listing "of the earth and of the heaven" and then immediately inverting it to "of the heaven and of the earth." This chiasmus encloses the entire visible cosmos which they study so intently. Yet, they fail to *dokimazein* (examine/test) the *kairon* (the critical time). The "how" (*pōs*) suggests a willful ignorance; they have the capacity to know, but they refuse to look.

**Verse 57**

**Greek Text**
τι δε και αφ εαυτ εαυτ ου κρινετε το δικ(αι)

**English Translation**
And why even from yourselves—yourselves—do you not judge what is just?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord appeals to the natural law written in the conscience. The doubling of *heautōn* (yourselves) in the text emphasizes that the source of judgment is internal. They need not wait for a sign from the sky; the faculty to discern *to dikaion* (the just thing) is inherent in their creation as rational beings. Their failure to judge is a failure of the will, not the intellect.

**Verse 58**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ γαρ μετα του αντιδικου ϲου επ αρχοντα εν τη οδω δοϲ εργαϲι απηλλαχθαι α αυτου μηποτε καταϲυρη ϲε προϲ τον κριτην και ο κριτηϲ ϲε παραδω τω πρακτορι κ(αι) ο πρακτωρ ϲε >>> βαλει ϲε̣ ειϲ φυλακ

**English Translation**
For as [you go] with your adversary to a ruler, in the way give effort to have been released from him; lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you—you—into prison.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Life is the *hodos* (way) to the judgment seat. The *antidikou* (adversary) is the Law that accuses us. We must give *ergasian* (work/effort) to be reconciled while we are still alive. The sequence is terrifyingly bureaucratic: from ruler, to judge, to *praktor* (officer/bailiff), to prison. The repetition of *se* (you) at the moment of casting into prison makes the judgment inescapably personal. It is *you* who will be cast down if you do not repent on the way.

**Verse 59**

**Greek Text**
λεγω ϲοι ου μη εξελ εκειθεν εωϲ και το τον εϲχατον λε αποδωϲ

**English Translation**
I tell you, by no means shall you come out from there, until even the—the—last lepton you pay back.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The finality of divine justice is absolute. The *lepton* is the smallest of coins, yet God accounts for it. The stuttering article *to ton* before *eschaton* (last) underlines the precision of the debt. There is no "coming out" (*exelthēs*) until the full price of sin is paid. Since we cannot pay such a price, we must flee to the Merchant who paid it for us before the officer throws us into the eternal prison.
