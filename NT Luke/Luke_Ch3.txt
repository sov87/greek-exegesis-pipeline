**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
εν ετι δε δε πεντεκαι τηϲ ηγεμο τιβεριου και ηγεμονευ ποντιου πιλα τηϲ ϊουδ(αι)αϲ και τετρααρχο τετραρχο τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ ηρωδου φιλιππου δε του αδελφου αυ τετρααρχουν τετραρχουντοϲ τηϲ ϊτουραιαϲ τε τραχωνιτιδοϲ χωραϲ και λυϲανι ϊτουραιαϲ κ(αι) τραχωνιτιδοϲ χωραϲ και λυϲανιου τηϲ αβιληνηϲ τετρααρχουντοϲ τετραρχουντοϲ

**English Translation**
In the fifteenth year of the governorship of Tiberius... and Pontius Pilate governing Judea, and Herod tetrarch tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother tetrarch-ing tetrarch-ing of the Ituraean and Trachonitis region, and Lysanias... of the Ituraean and Trachonitis region and Lysanias of Abilene tetrarch-ing tetrarch-ing...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s trembling hand, repeating titles and regions ("tetrarch tetrarch," "Ituraea... Ituraea") as if overwhelmed by the weight of history. The text labors to establish a precise moment in time—the fifteenth year of Tiberius—anchoring the Divine mystery in human chronology. The fractured political state, ruled by a patchwork of governors and tetrarchs, mirrors the fractured state of the world awaiting the unifying King. The repetition of "tetrarch-ing" emphasizes the earthly powers' desperate grasp on authority, which is about to be superseded by the Kingdom of Heaven.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
επι αρχϊερεωϲ αννα και καϊαφα εγενετο ρημα επι ϊωαννην τ ζαχαριου ϋϊον τη ερημω

**English Translation**
Upon High Priest Annas and Caiaphas, came a word upon John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A great paradox is preserved here: the text uses the singular "High Priest" (*archiereos*) for two men, Annas and Caiaphas. This grammatical irregularity exposes the corruption of the Levitical order, where the office had become a political appointment rather than a lifelong divine vocation. Because the Temple was compromised by this duality, the *Rhema* (Word) of God bypassed the Holy of Holies in Jerusalem and descended instead upon the wilderness, finding a pure vessel in John, the son of the priest Zechariah.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και ηλ ειϲ παϲαν τ τ περιχωρον του ϊορδανου κηρυϲ βαπτιϲμα με ειϲ αφεϲ αφεϲ αμαρτιων

**English Translation**
And he came into all the the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of re[pentance] for forgive- forgiveness of sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters on "the the" (*t t*) and repeats "forgiveness" (*aphes aphes*), while abbreviating "repentance" (*me* for *metanoias*). This scribal urgency reflects the spiritual reality: forgiveness is doubly emphasized because the need for it is abundant. John moves through the "perichoron" (the region around), encircling the Jordan, preparing the waters that once parted for Joshua to now part the heavens for the Christ. The baptism is not yet of the Spirit, but of repentance—a clearing of the soul's debris.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ γε εν βιβλω λογων ηϲαϊου του προφητου φω βοωντοϲ εν τη ερημω ετοιμα την οδον ευθιαϲ ποιειται ταϲ τριβουϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: A voice crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way, make straight his paths.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prophecy of Isaiah is invoked to validate the Baptist. The text commands "Prepare" (*hetoima*), an imperative addressed to the human will. The scribe omits the specific object of the "Way" (usually *Kyriou* - of the Lord), leaving simply "the Way." This absolute phrasing reminds us that there is only one path to life. The "paths" (*tribous*) are the worn tracks of our habitual sins, which must be made straight (*euthias*) to receive the King who travels on the highway of holiness.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
παϲα φαραγξ πλη και π π οροϲ και βουνοϲ ταπινωθηϲετε και εϲτε τα ϲκολι ειϲ ευθιαν και αι τροχιαι τραχιαι ειϲ οδουϲ λιαϲ

**English Translation**
Every valley shall be filled, and e- every mountain and hill shall be humbled, and the crooked shall be into straight, and the rough ways into smooth roads.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A topographical allegory for the soul. The "mountains and hills" represent the pride of the demons and the arrogance of men, which must be "humbled" (*tapinothesete*). The "valleys" are the despairing and the lowly, who shall be filled with grace. The scribe struggles with "rough ways" (*trochiai trachiai*), correcting the spelling, just as the rough patches of our lives must be smoothed out. The transformation is total: the landscape of the heart is leveled to allow God's approach.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και οψεται παϲα ϲαρξ το ϲω του

**English Translation**
And all flesh shall see the sa[lvation] of [God/Him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is starkly abbreviated: *to so tou* ("the sa[lvation] of [Him]"). The word for salvation (*soterion*) is cut short, yet it contains the root of the Savior (*Soter*). The promise is universal: "all flesh" (*pasa sarx*), not just the seed of Abraham. The gentiles, who were once far off, are included in this vision. To "see" this salvation is not merely to observe with eyes, but to perceive with the spirit the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ελεγον ελεγεν ουν τοιϲ εκπορευομενοιϲ οχλοιϲ βαπτιϲθη ϋπ αυτου γεν εχιδν τιϲ φυγειν απο τηϲ μελλουϲηϲ οργηϲ

**English Translation**
He was saying therefore to the crowds going out to be baptized by him: Brood of vipers, who [warned] to flee from the coming wrath?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe corrects *elegon* (they said) to *elegen* (he said), clarifying the singular authority of the Baptist. He addresses the crowds as *gen echidn* (offspring of vipers). This is a piercing rebuke; he identifies them not as children of the Patriarchs, but as kin to the serpent of Eden, full of poison and deceit. They seek baptism as a magical ward against "wrath," but John demands an internal transformation, not just a ritual flight.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ποιηϲατε ουν καρ αξιουϲ τηϲ με και μη αρ λεγειν εν ε πατερα εχο τον αβρααμ λεγω γαρ ϋμιν ο δυναται ο εκ των λιθων του εγειραι τεκνα τω αβρααμʼ

**English Translation**
Produce therefore fruits worthy of re[pentance], and do not begin to say in yourselves, We have a father, Abraham. For I say to you that [God] is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates "fruits" (*kar*) and "repentance" (*me*), rushing to the theological climax. John attacks the Jewish reliance on lineage. "Do not begin to say" implies they have not yet uttered it, but the thought festers in their hearts. The claim that God can raise children from "stones" (*lithon*) is a prophecy of the Gentiles—we who were cold and dead like stones are made living sons of Abraham through faith, superseding the biological claim.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ηδη δε και η αξινη προϲ την ριζαν των δ δ κειται π ουν δενδρον μη ποιουν καρπον καλον εκκοπτε και ειϲ πυρ βαλ

**English Translation**
And already the axe is laid at the root of the tr- trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stutter on "trees" (*d d*) emphasizes the multitude of souls facing judgment. The axe lies not at the branches (for pruning) but at the *root* (*rizan*) for total excision. This signifies the end of the dispensation of the Law and the beginning of a radical judgment. The "fire" (*pyr*) is the final destination for the barren soul. Mere existence as a "tree" in God's vineyard is insufficient; there must be "good fruit."

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και επηρω αυτον οι ο λεγοντεϲ τι ουν ποιηϲωμ ποιηϲωμ

**English Translation**
And the cr- crowds asked him, saying: What therefore shall we do? shall we do?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe's repetition of "shall we do" (*poiesom poiesom*) accidentally captures the frantic anxiety of the people. Struck by the terror of the axe and the fire, the crowds are awakened from their lethargy. This is the beginning of conversion: the desperate question of a soul realizing its danger. They move from passive listeners to active seekers of a rule of life.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ελε αυτοιϲ ο εχ δυο χιτωναϲ με τω μη εχ και ο εχων βρω ομοιωϲ ποιει

**English Translation**
And answering he said to them: The one having two tunics, let him share with the one not having, and the one having foods, let him do likewise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The answer to the threat of cosmic fire is simple, earthly charity. The text abbreviates "foods" (*bro* for *bromata*), focusing on the essentials of survival. John does not command them to retreat to the desert like him, but to practice love within the city. To "share" (*metadoto*) is to acknowledge that our possessions are not our own but are held in trust for the poor. The "two tunics" represents superfluity; the Christian requires only what is necessary.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ηλθον δε και τελωναι βαπτι και ειπ προϲ αυτον διδα τι ποιηϲω

**English Translation**
And tax collectors also came to be bapt[ized], and said to him: Teach[er], what shall we do?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the *telonai* (tax collectors), the collaborators with Rome and symbols of greed, approach the waters. They address him as *Dida* (Teacher/Master), submitting to his authority. The text shows that the call to repentance excludes no one, not even those most despised by society. Their question "what shall we do?" proves that even the most entangled sinner can cut the knots of iniquity through obedience to the Prophet.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ μηδεν πλεον παρα το δι ϋ πραϲϲετε

**English Translation**
And he said to them, "Exact nothing more beside that which is appointed to you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the moderation of the Forerunner. He does not command the tax collectors to abandon their station, acknowledging the necessity of the state's treasury. Rather, he strikes at the root of their specific sin: avarice and the abuse of authority. Justice, in the eyes of the Lord, is not the abdication of duty, but the performance of it within the bounds of the *diatetagmenon* (the appointed ordinance).

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ε δε αυ και ϲτρατευο λεγοντεϲ τι ποιηϲωμεν και ημιϲ και ειπ προϲ αυτουϲ μη διαϲειϲητε μηδενα μηδε ϲυκοφ και αρκι τοιϲ οψωνι ϋμων

**English Translation**
And soldiers also asked him, saying, "What shall we do, even we?" And he said to them, "Do not shake down anyone, nor accuse falsely, and be sufficient with your wages."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the men of the sword are not barred from the Kingdom, provided the sword is used for order and not plunder. The Greek *diaseisete* implies a violent shaking—extortion by terror. Coupled with *sykophantesete* (false accusation), we see the dual weapons of the corrupt soldier: physical force and legal manipulation. The cure prescribed is *arkeisthe*—contentment with one's rations. Greed turns a guardian into a bandit.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
προϲδοκωντοϲ δε του λαου και δι παντων εν ταιϲ καρδιαιϲ αυτων εαυτων περι του ϊωαννου μηποτε αυτοϲ ειη ο

**English Translation**
And as the people were expecting, and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the [Christ]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe here preserves a correction, *auton heauton*, emphasizing the reflexive intensity of their internal debate. The people are starved for redemption, leading them to mistake the lamp for the Light. It is the burden of the priesthood to discern the spirits, for the heart of the crowd is easily swayed by the spectacle of asceticism, wondering if the servant is the Master.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
απεκρι λεγων παϲ παϲ λεγων ο ϊωαννηϲ εγω μεν ϋδατι βαπτι ϋμαϲ ερχεται δε ο ϊϲχυροτεροϲ μου ου ουκ ιμι ϊ λυϲαι τον ϊμαντα των αυτου αυτοϲ αυτοϲ ϋμαϲ βαπτιϲει αγιω και πυ

**English Translation**
...he answered, saying to all—John says—"I indeed baptize you with water; but the Stronger One than I comes, of whom I am not worthy to loose the strap of his [sandals]; He himself will baptize you with [Holy Spirit] and fire."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John confesses his limitation. Water washes the skin, but it cannot transmute the soul. The *Ischyroteros* (the Stronger One) brings a baptism of *pyri* (fire). As fire refines gold and consumes dross, so too does the Spirit of Christ operate—it is not merely a washing, but a fundamental alteration of substance. The repetition in the text (*autos autos*) underlines the emphatic agency of Christ alone in this saving act.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ὁυ το πτυον εν τη χειρι αυτου δι κ(αι) διακαθαρειει την αλω αυτου και ϲυνα ϲυναξαι ϲυναξει τον ϲιτον ειϲ την αποθηκ αυτου αυτου το δε αχυρ καταϲβεϲι κατακαυϲι πυρι α

**English Translation**
...whose winnowing fork is in His hand to thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn up with fire un[quenchable].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the terrifying scrutiny of the Judge. The threshing floor is the Church; the wheat are the faithful, heavy with the grain of virtue; the chaff are the hollow, light with vanity. The *diakathariei* indicates a cleansing that is thorough and final. Note the scribe's struggle with *katakausi* (burn up)—the fire here is destructive, distinct from the illuminating fire of baptism. It is the fire that remains when the Spirit is rejected.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
πολλα μεν ουν και ετερα παρακαλ ευηγγελιζε τον ευηγγελιζετο τον λαον

**English Translation**
Many things therefore and different, exhorting, he preached good news to the people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Do not think that warnings of fire negate the *euangelizeto* (good news). The Gospel contains both the promise of the barn and the warning of the flame. To exhort (*parakalon*) toward repentance is the highest form of charity. The scribe’s repetition of the verb emphasizes the persistence of John’s proclamation.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ηρωδηϲ ο τετρααρχηϲ τετραρχηϲ ελεγ ϋπ αυτου περι ηρωδιαδοϲ τηϲ γυναικοϲ του αδελφου αυτου κ(αι) περι παντων τ πονηρων ων ε ων εποιηϲεν πονηρων ων εποιηϲεν τ πονηρων ο ηρωδηϲ

**English Translation**
But Herod the Tetrarch, being reproved by him concerning Herodias, the wife of his brother, and concerning all the evils which Herod did...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is heavy with the repetition of *poneron* (evils), mirroring the accumulation of Herod's sins. The prophet speaks truth to power, striking at the specific immorality of the ruler. The sin of the flesh (Herodias) is but one of "all the evils." A ruler who corrupts the law of marriage will inevitably corrupt the laws of the land.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
προϲεθηκεν και τουτο επι παϲιν κ(αι) κατεκλιϲεν τον ϊωαννην εν φυ

**English Translation**
...added also this upon all, and shut up John in pri[son].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To sin is human; to silence the voice of conscience is demonic. By imprisoning the prophet, Herod "added this upon all"—it is the capstone of his iniquity. He attempts to bind the Word of God by binding the messenger, not knowing that the Truth cannot be held by stone walls.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν τω βαπτιϲθηναι π π τον λαον και βαπτιϲθεντοϲ και προϲευχομε ανεωχθη τον ουρανον

**English Translation**
Now it came to pass, in the being baptized of [all] the people, and [He] having been baptized and praying, the heaven was opened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark this well: The heavens open not merely at the immersion, but *proseuchomenou*—while He was praying. The Lord enters the waters not to be cleansed, for He is pure, but to sanctify the waters for us. His prayer acts as the key to the firmament, re-establishing the communion between earth and heaven that Adam had closed.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και καταβηναι το π το αγιον ϲω ειδι ωϲ περιϲτεραν επ αυ και φωνην εξ ουρανου γενε ϲυ ει ο μου ο αγαπητοϲ εν ϲοι ευδοκηϲα

**English Translation**
...and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon him, and a voice came out of heaven: "You are my Beloved [Son]; in You I am well pleased."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A supreme revelation of the Triad. The Spirit appears *somatiko eidei* (in bodily form) to refute those who would claim the vision was a mere phantasm. The Dove signifies the peace of the new creation, hovering over the waters as at the beginning. The Voice of the Father confirms the Sonship, not by adoption, but by nature (*Sy ei*—You ARE).

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και αυ ην αρχομε ωϲει ετων ων ˙ ϋϊοϲ ωϲ ενο ιωϲηφʼ του ηλει

**English Translation**
And He was beginning [to be] about years [thirty], being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, of Heli,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist anchors the mystery in history. *Hos enomizeto* ("as was supposed") guards the Virgin Birth—Joseph is the legal guardian, not the biological father. The age of thirty marks the canonical maturity for priesthood. He steps forward now, fully man and fully God, tracing his lineage through the legal father to show He is the fulfillment of Israel's history.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
του μαθεαθ μαθθαθ του λευει του μελχει του ιανναι του ϊωϲηφ

**English Translation**
...of Matthat, of Levi, of Melchi, of Jannai, of Joseph.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
These names, a chain of mortality, bind the Savior to the human race. He is not a celestial apparition but a son of David, a son of Abraham, a son of Adam. By assuming this lineage, He sanctifies the generations, preparing to reverse the curse that flowed down through these very veins.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
του ματταθιου του αμωϲ του ναουμ του εϲλει του ναγγαι

**English Translation**
of Mattathias, of Amos, of Naoum, of Eslei, of Naggai

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we tread the quiet centuries, the era of silence before the Word cried out in the wilderness. Observe the names: *Mattathias* recalls the zeal of the Maccabees, yet here it rests in the humble lineage of the carpenter. *Amos* and *Naoum* (Nahum) bear the names of prophets, signifying that the prophetic spirit, though silent in open revelation, remained woven into the flesh of the Messiah’s ancestors. The text flows without interruption, a river of grace moving underground, preparing to burst forth.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
του μααθ του ματταθιου του ϲεμεειν του ϊωϲηχ του ϊωδα

**English Translation**
of Maath, of Mattathias, of Semeein, of Josech, of Joda

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Attend to the precision of the scribe. We find *Josech* (ϊωϲηχ), not Joseph; a distinction preserved in our most ancient codices, guarding the specific identity of this forefather against the assimilation of common names. *Semeein* (Semei) recalls the Shimeites of the Levites, yet here is the royal blood. The repetition of *Mattathias* suggests the pious recurrence of names within families, a custom of the faithful remnant waiting for the consolation of Israel.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
του ϊωναν ϊωαναν ϊωαναν του ρηϲα του ζοροβαβελ του ϲαλαθιηλ του νηρει

**English Translation**
of Jonan [Joanan Joanan], of Resa, of Zorobabel, of Salathiel, of Nerei

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here witnesses a struggle of the pen, writing *Jonan*, then correcting and repeating *Joanan*, as if to ensure the name is not lost to brevity. But look to the anchor: *Zorobabel* and *Salathiel*. Here the genealogy touches the great wound of the Exile and the return. Zorobabel, the governor who rebuilt the Temple, stands as a type of Christ, the true Temple builder. Yet, unlike Matthew’s account which traces the legal throne, Luke traces the biological descent, linking Zorobabel to *Nerei*, suggesting a legal adoption or a levirate mystery, uniting the kingly dignity with the private line of Nathan.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
του μελχει του αδδει του κωϲα κωϲαμ του ελμαδαμ του ηρ

**English Translation**
of Melchei, of Addei, of Kosa [Kosam], of Elmadam, of Er

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text corrects *Kosa* to *Kosam*, a divine stuttering in the ink to reach the true sound of the father’s name. These men—Melchei, Addei, Elmadam—are unknown to the histories of kings. They are the "stump of Jesse" hewn down to the roots. The glory of David has passed into the obscurity of the soil, hidden until the Branch (Christ) should spring from *Er* and his kin. God’s promise is kept not in palaces, but in the genealogy of the humble.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
του ϊηϲου του ελιαζερ ελιαιζερ του ϊωριμ του μαθθααθ μαθθαθ του λευει

**English Translation**
of Jesus, of Eliazer [Eliaizer], of Jorim, of Maththaath [Maththath], of Leuei

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Marvel, brethren, that the name *Jesus* (Joshua) appears here in the ancestry! It is a flash of lightning before the storm. This ancestor bore the Name of Salvation as a shadow, just as Joshua the son of Nun led the people into the land. The scribe wrestles with the spelling of *Eliazer* and *Maththaath*, adding letters to capture the Semitic breath. *Leuei* (Levi) appears again, reminding us that while this is a royal line, it is suffused with the priestly name, for Christ is both King and Priest.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
του ϲυμεων του ϊουδα του ϊωϲηφ του ϊωναμ του ελιακειμ

**English Translation**
of Symeon, of Judas, of Joseph, of Jonam, of Eliakeim

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The great patriarchal names return in echo: *Symeon, Judas, Joseph*. It is as if the history of the twelve tribes is being recapitulated in this single family line. Note the reading *Jonam* (ϊωναμ), distinct from the Jonan of verse 27. The text distinguishes the generations carefully. *Eliakeim* signifies "God raises up"—a fitting name for a lineage that God sustained through the collapse of the monarchy, raising up sons to David when the throne seemed empty.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
του μελεα του μεννα του ματταθα του ναθαμ ναθαν του δ

**English Translation**
of Melea, of Menna, of Mattatha, of Natham [Nathan], of D[avid]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We arrive at the divergence. Through *Nathan*, not Solomon. The text corrects *Natham* to *Nathan*, ensuring the prophet-named son of David is identified. And then, the abrupt abbreviation: *tou D*. The scribe bows before the name of the King, *David*, often marking it with the nomina sacra or simply the initial, for the name of David is the pivot of the ages. By tracing through Nathan, the Evangelist shows us a Christ who is of David’s blood but separate from the accursed line of Jeconiah; a King of hearts, not merely of edicts.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
του ϊεϲϲαι του ϊωβηλ ϊωβηδ του βαλλϲ βοοϲ του ϲαλα ϲαλμων του νααϲϲ

**English Translation**
of Jesse, of Jobel [Jobed], of Balls [Boos], of Sala [Salmon], of Naass[on]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Great turbulence in the manuscript here! The scribe writes *Jobel* then corrects to *Jobed* (Obed); writes *Balls* then corrects to *Boos* (Boaz); expands *Sala* to *Salmon*. It is as if the Greek tongue struggles to pronounce the Hebrew roots of the Redemption. *Boaz*, the redeemer of Ruth the Moabitess, stands here. The text’s instability testifies to its antiquity; we see the very labor of preserving the names that led to the Root of Jesse.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
του αδαμ αμιναδαβ του αδμιν του αρνει του εϲρωμ του φαρεϲ του ϊουδα

**English Translation**
of Adam [Aminadab], of Admin, of Arnei, of Esrom, of Phares, of Judas

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery or a scribal conflation? The text reads *tou Adam Aminadab*. Why does *Adam* appear here, so long after the Garden? Is it a slip for *Admin* (which follows), or a theological gloss asserting a new beginning? The corrector smooths it to *Aminadab*. Furthermore, we see *Admin* and *Arnei* inserted where other texts read Aram. This codex preserves a distinct memory of the descent in Egypt, names lost to the standard histories but kept in the scroll of life. We see the line of *Judas* (Judah) and *Phares*, the illicit seed sanctified by providence.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
του ϊακωβ του ϊϲακ ϊϲαακ του αβρααμ του θαρα θαρρα του ναχωρ

**English Translation**
of Jacob, of Isak [Isaak], of Abraham, of Thara [Tharra], of Nachor

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We ascend to the peaks: *Jacob, Isaac, Abraham*. The scribe corrects *Isak* to *Isaak* and *Thara* to *Tharra*, adding weight to the vowels. Here is the Covenant. Here is the Promise. The genealogy moves from the localized kingship of David to the universal promise of Abraham, "in your seed shall all nations be blessed." The text stands firm here, the names monumental and unshakeable.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
του ϲερουχ του ραγαυ του φαλεκ του εβερ του ϲαλα

**English Translation**
of Serouch, of Ragau, of Phalek, of Eber, of Sala

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We cross the waters of history back toward the Flood. *Phalek* (Peleg), in whose days the earth was divided, reminds us of the scattering of Babel which Christ comes to gather. *Eber*, the father of the Hebrews, marks the linguistic separation of the holy people. The genealogy is a narrowing funnel: from the nations to the Hebrews, to Judah, to David, to the Virgin.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
του καϊναμ του αρφαξαδ του ϲημ του νωε του λαμεχ

**English Translation**
of Kainam, of Arphaxad, of Sem, of Noe, of Lamech

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the reading *Kainam* inserted between Arphaxad and Sala (implied in v35), a name found in the Seventy (Septuagint) but absent in the Hebrew verity. The Evangelist follows the Greek Bible of the Church. We end this portion with *Noe* (Noah) and *Lamech*, the fathers of the regeneration of the world by water—a type of the Baptism which Christ has just undergone in the Jordan. The lineage is not merely biological; it is typological, flowing from the waters of the Flood to the waters of Baptism.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
του μαθουϲαλα του ενωχ του ϊαρετ του μελελεηλ μαλελεηλ του καϊναμ

**English Translation**
of Mathousala, of Enoch, of Iaret, of Meleleel Maleleel, of Kainam

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here, beloved, the ascent into the ancient days before the Flood. We encounter Enoch, he who pleased God and was translated, breaking the iron law of death even before the Incarnation, serving as a type of the ascension to come. The text before us exhibits a curious doubling, reading *Meleleel Maleleel*, as if the scribe’s hand trembled or sought to correct the spelling of this patriarch’s name in the very act of writing. We also find Kainam listed here, a name preserved by the Seventy Interpreters (LXX) and the Evangelist, though silent in the Hebrew genesis, reminding us that the Spirit breathes where He wills, preserving the lineage through the Greek tongue for the salvation of the nations.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we arrive at the very root of the human tree. We see Enos, in whose time men began to call upon the name of the Lord. We see Seth—written here with a stutter or correction as *Ses Seth*—he who was given in place of righteous Abel. Finally, we reach Adam, the protoplast, the clay formed by the hands of the Artificer. The genealogy concludes with the solitary article *tou* ("of the"), hanging in the air. Though the Sacred Name is not written in this fragment, the article points inevitably upward, beyond flesh, beyond Adam, to the Uncreated Source. Adam has no earthly father; he is "of the" [God]. Thus, the Second Adam (Christ) is shown to be the Son of God by nature, just as the first Adam was by creation.
