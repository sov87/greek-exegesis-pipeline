**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε και προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ · ανθρωποϲ τιϲ ην πλουϲιοϲ οϲ ειχεν οικονομον και ουτοϲ διεβληθη αυτω ωϲ διαϲκορ τα ϋπαρχ αυτου

**English Translation**
And he said also unto the disciples: There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this one was accused to him as scattering his possessions.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, that the Lord speaks *pros tous mathetas* (to the disciples), indicating this instruction is for the initiated, not the multitude. The charge against the steward is *diaskor*—abbreviated here for *diaskorpizon*—meaning he was "scattering" or wasting that which was not his own. In the eyes of God, we are all stewards; our wealth, our bodies, and our time are the *hyparch* (possessions) of the Creator. To use them selfishly is to scatter what God has gathered.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και φω αυτον ει τι τουτο ακου περι ϲου αποδοϲ τον λογον τηϲ οι ϲου ου γαρ ετι δυνη οικο

**English Translation**
And having called him he said: What is this I hear concerning thee? Render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst no longer be steward.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates heavily here, reflecting the urgency of the judgment. *Apodos ton logon* (render the account/word) is the terror of the Final Judgment. The master does not ask *if* the rumors are true; the accusation suffices to strip the steward of his office (*ou gar eti dyne oiko*). We must live daily as if the call to render our account were sounding in our ears this very hour.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε εν εαυτω ο οικο τι ποιηϲω οτι ο μου αφαι την οικονο απ εμου · ϲκα ουκ ϊϲχυω επαιτιν αιϲχυνομαι

**English Translation**
And the steward said within himself: What shall I do, because my [master] taketh away the stewardship from me? To dig I have not strength, to beg I am ashamed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The internal dialogue of the sinner facing judgment. The text reads *o mou* (my [master]), omitting the noun, yet the relationship of subordination remains. He rejects *ska* (digging), which signifies the hard labor of repentance which he is too weak to perform, and *epaitin* (begging), for his pride is not yet broken. He seeks a path that preserves his comfort without the toil of the soil.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
εγνων τι ποιηϲω ϊνα αν μεταϲταθω εκ τηϲ οικονομιαϲ δεξωνται με ειϲ τουϲ οικουϲ εαυτ

**English Translation**
I know what I will do, that when I am removed from the stewardship, they may receive me into their own houses.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Egnon* (I knew/I have decided). A flash of worldly prudence. His goal is reception (*dexontai*) into temporal habitations (*oikous*). Note the abbreviation *eaut* for *eauton* (their own). He plans to use the master's remaining authority to secure favor with men. It is a perverse mirror of the Christian hope to be received into eternal habitations by the saints.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲα ενα εκαϲτ των χρεοφιλετ του αυτου εαυτου εαυτου ελε τω πρωτω πο οφιλειϲ τω μου ·

**English Translation**
And having summoned one [by] each of the debtors of his own [master], he said to the first: How much owest thou to my [master]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex here exhibits a peculiar repetition: *tou autou eautou eautou* (of his own, own, own [master]). Whether a scribal error or an emphasis, it starkly highlights the ownership of the debt—it belongs entirely to the master, not the steward. Yet, the steward acts as though he holds the keys to binding and loosing. He interrogates the debtor to make the debtor complicit in the falsification.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπ αυτω εκατον βα ελαιου ο δε ει αυτω δεξαι ϲου τα γραμματα και κα ταχεωϲ γρα πεντηκον ˙

**English Translation**
And he said to him: A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him: Receive thy letters and sit down quickly [and] write fifty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command *katheos* (quickly) is significant. Sin often requires haste, lest the conscience awaken or the master return. He reduces the debt by half (*pentekon*). By alleviating the burden of another using property that is not his, he buys friendship. In the spiritual sense, we should be quick to forgive the debts of others against us, for that is the only "currency" we truly have right to remit.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
επειτα ετερω ει ϲυ δε ποϲον οφιλειϲ ο δε ειπ εκατον κορουϲ ϲι · λεγει δε αυτω δεξαι ϲου τα γραμ και γραψον ογδοηκοντα ˙

**English Translation**
Then to another he said: And thou, how much owest thou? And he said: A hundred cors of wheat. And he says to him: Receive thy letters and write eighty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the debt is wheat (*si* for *sitou*), and the reduction is twenty percent. The variation matters less than the act of complicity. The steward binds these men to him through shared illicit gain. He is building a refuge for himself in the world. The text shows the steward distributing the master's goods to secure his own future—a twisted type of almsgiving.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και επηνεϲεν ο τ οικονομον τηϲ αδικιαϲ οτι φρο εποιηϲ εποιηϲ οτι φρονιμωτε οι υϊοι του αιω τουτου τουϲ ϋϊουϲ του φω ειϲ την γενε ταυτην την την εαυτ εαυτ ειϲιν ˙

**English Translation**
And the [lord] praised the steward of unrighteousness because he did prudently; for the sons of this age are more prudent [than] the sons of light towards their own generation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A difficult passage, rendered more complex by the scribe's stuttering hand (*epoies epoies* and *ten ten eaut eaut*). The master (*o t* likely standing for *o kyrios*) praises not the theft, but the *phronesis* (prudence/foresight). The repetition *eaut eaut* (themselves themselves) emphasizes the self-centered focus of the "sons of this age." They are diligent for their temporal survival, while we, the "sons of light," are often sluggish regarding our eternal survival.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
και εγω λεγω εαυτοιϲ ποι ποιηϲατε εαυτοιϲ ποιηϲατε εαυτοιϲ φιλουϲ εκ του μαμωνα τηϲ αδικιαϲ ϊνα οταν εκλιπη εκλιπηται εκλιπη δεξων ειϲ ταϲ αι ϲκηναϲ ˙ ‾‾

**English Translation**
And I say: Make to yourselves, make to yourselves friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when it fails, fails, they may receive [you] into the eternal tabernacles.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex Sinaiticus here is emphatic through error or zeal: *poiesate* (make) is repeated, and *eklipe* (fails) appears three times in varying forms. This underscores the absolute certainty that Mammon *will* fail. The command is to use this fleeting, unrighteous wealth (by giving alms to the poor) so that when we die, those poor—who are friends of God—may welcome us into the *ai* (eternal) tents.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ο πιϲτοϲ εν ελα και εν πολ πιϲτοϲ εϲτιν και ο εν ελαχιϲτω αδικοϲ και εν πολ αδικοϲ εϲτιν ˙

**English Translation**
He that is faithful in least is faithful also in much; and he that is unrighteous in least is unrighteous also in much.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "least" (*ela* for *elachisto*) is money; the "much" (*pol* for *pollo*) is spiritual grace. The Lord establishes a hierarchy of value. If one cannot be trusted with the dust of the earth (gold), how can God entrust him with the spiritual gifts of the episcopate or the mysteries of the Kingdom? Integrity is indivisible.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν εν τω αδι μαμωνα πι ουκ εγενεϲθαι το αληθινον τιϲ ϋμιν πιϲτευϲει ˙

**English Translation**
If therefore ye became not faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true [riches]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes *egenesthai* (ye became/proved to be). Life is the testing ground. "Unrighteous mammon" is not necessarily stolen money, but wealth itself, which is often tainted by the world and is foreign to our spiritual nature. The "true" (*alethinon*) is the Beatific Vision. If we fail the test of charity with coins, we are denied the treasury of heaven.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και ει εν τω αλλο πιϲτοι ουκ ε το ϋμε τιϲ δωϲει ϋμιν

**English Translation**
And if ye [became] not faithful in that which is another's, who will give to you that which is [yours]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound paradox. Wealth is *allo* (another's)—it passes from hand to hand and stays with no one. The Kingdom of God is *hyme* (yours)—it is the inheritance prepared for you. But God will not give you your own inheritance if you have not faithfully administered the foreign goods (worldly wealth) entrusted to you for the poor. We are but stewards of "another's" goods until we enter our true home.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ουδειϲ οικετηϲ δυ δυϲι κυριοιϲ δουλευειν ˙ ει γαρ τον ενα μιϲηϲι και τον ετερον α ˙ η ενοϲ ανθεξεται και του ετερου καταφρο ˙ ου δυναϲθαι δουλευειν και μαμωνα ˙

**English Translation**
No domestic servant [is able] to serve two—two—lords; for either the one he will hate and the other [love], or to one he will hold and the other despise; you are not able to serve [God] and Mammon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the stricture of the soul’s economy. The text reads *oiketes* (domestic servant), one who dwells within the house, implying an intimacy that permits no divided loyalty. The scribe’s stutter—*dy dysi* (two, two)—unintentionally emphasizes the duality which the soul must reject. We cannot partition our worship; to cling (*anthexetai*) to the earth is to despise (*kataphronēsei*) the Heaven. Mammon is not merely gold, but a rival master demanding a service that belongs solely to the Divine.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ηκουον δε ταυτα παντα οι φαριϲαιοι φιλαργυροι ϋπαρχοντεϲ και εξεμυκτηριζον αυτον

**English Translation**
Now the Pharisees, being lovers of money, were hearing all these things and were sneering at him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The root of their derision is laid bare: they are *philarguroi* (silver-lovers). The word of Truth strikes the idol in their hearts, and thus they react with scorn. The Greek *exemykterizon* implies a turning up of the nose—a physical manifestation of spiritual pride. They mock the Physician because they love their disease.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ ϋ εϲτε οι δικαι εαυτουϲ ε των αν ὁ δε γινωϲκει ταϲ καρ ϋμων οτι το εν ανθρωποιϲ ϋψη βδελυγμα ενω του

**English Translation**
And he said to them: You are those justifying yourselves [before] men, but [God] knows your hearts; because that which is high among men is an abomination before [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great inversion. The Pharisee seeks a forensic verdict of innocence (*dikaiountes*) from the court of human opinion (*enōpion tōn anthrōpōn*). But the Eye that sees the *kardias* (hearts) judges differently. That which men elevate as *hypsēlon* (lofty/high)—wealth, status, outward piety—is termed *bdelygma* (an abomination, a foul thing) in the sight of the Holy One.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ὁ νομοϲ και οι προ μεχρι ϊωαν απο τοτε η βαϲι του ευαγγε βια ευαγγελιζεται κ(αι) παϲ ειϲ αυτην βιαζεται κ(αι) βιαϲται αρπαζουϲιν αυτην

**English Translation**
The law and the prophets [were] until John; from then the kingdom of [God] is evangelized, and everyone forces into it, and the forceful seize it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful and mighty reading is preserved here. The dispensation shifts at the Baptist; the Law yields to the *Basileia* (Kingdom). Yet, note the violence of the entry. It is not for the passive. The text tells us *biastai harpazousin autēn* (violent ones seize it)—a reading often found in the account of Matthew, yet here present in our Luke. It suggests that the Kingdom requires a spiritual militancy, a stripping away of the world with the same intensity that men use to sack a city. We must seize the Kingdom by doing violence to our own passions.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ευκοπω δε εϲτιν τ ουρανον και την γην παρελθιν η του νομου μιαν καιρεαν πεϲιν ˙

**English Translation**
But it is easier for the heaven and the earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fall.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Lest one think the "forcing" of the Kingdom abolishes the moral order, the Lord anchors the Law's permanence. The *keraian* is the smallest stroke of a pen, a mere horn on a letter. Creation itself—heaven and earth—is more fragile than the moral will of God expressed in His Law. The Gospel fulfills; it does not dissolve.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
παϲ ο απολυων τ τ γυναικα αυτου και γαμων ετεραν μοι ˙ και παϲ ο απο απο ανδροϲ γαμων μοι ˙

**English Translation**
Everyone releasing his wife and marrying another commits adultery; and everyone marrying [one] released from a husband commits adultery.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stammers in awe—*t t* (the, the) and *apo apo* (from, from)—perhaps trembling at the severity of the command. The bond of marriage is ontological, reflecting the union of God and His people. To sever it for another is *moicheuei* (adultery). This verse stands as a bulwark against the fluidity of human desire, anchoring the domestic church in the immutability of the Divine Law mentioned in the previous verse.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ανθρωποϲ δε τιϲ πλουϲιοϲ και ενε πορφυ και βυϲϲον ευ κα ημεραν λαμπρωϲ

**English Translation**
Now a certain man was rich and was clothed in purple and fine linen, making merry every day splendidly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark that the rich man has no name in the text; he is defined only by his possessions. He is wrapped in *porphyran* (purple, the color of kings) and *bysson* (fine linen, the texture of softness). His life is a perpetual liturgy of self-indulgence (*euphrainomenos*), celebrated not on Sabbaths alone, but *kath' hēmeran* (every day). He has received his consolation in full.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
πτωχοϲ δε τιϲ ονο λαζαροϲ εβε προϲ τον πυ αυτου ειλκω

**English Translation**
But a certain poor man named Lazaros was cast at his gate, covered with sores,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The poor man possesses nothing but a name, *Lazaros* (God helps), which is written in the Book of Life. He was "cast" (*ebeblēto*) there, implying helplessness. The contrast is visceral: the rich man in linen, Lazarus in *hēlkōmenos* (ulcerated sores). The gate (*pylōna*) serves as the boundary between the kingdom of mammon and the kingdom of suffering.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και επιθυ χορταϲθηναι απο των ψιχι των πιπτον απο τηϲ τρα του πλουϲι αλλα και οι κυνεϲ ερχομενοι επε τα ελκη αυ ˙

**English Translation**
and desiring to be satisfied from the crumbs falling from the table of the rich [man]; but even the dogs coming were licking his sores.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the depth of his abasement. He desires not the feast, but the *psichiōn* (crumbs). The intervention of the dogs is a dual sign: they are unclean beasts, adding ritual insult to injury, yet in their licking (*epeleichon*), they offer a perverse compassion that the human master of the house withheld. Nature tends to the sufferer while the wealthy man ignores him.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε απο τον πτω και απενεχθη αυτον ϋπο τ αγγελων ειϲ τον κολπον αβρααμ απεθανεν δε και ο πλουϲιοϲ και ετα

**English Translation**
Now it happened [that] the poor [man] died and was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham; and the rich [man] also died and was buried.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Death is the great equalizer of bodies, but the differentiator of souls. Lazarus is escorted by angels to the *kolpon Abraam* (the bosom of Abraham), the place of ancestral comfort and promise. The rich man merely "died and was buried" (*etaphē*). The earth received the one who lived for the earth; Heaven received the one who possessed nothing but God.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και εν τω αδη επα τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ αυτου ϋπαρχων εν βαϲανοιϲ ορα αβρααμ απο μακρο και λαζαρον εν τοιϲ κολποιϲ αυ

**English Translation**
And in Hades lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham from afar and Lazaros in his bosoms.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the realm of the unseen (*Hadēs*), true sight is restored. He who was blind to the beggar at his gate now sees him clearly. But notice the geography of judgment: he sees them *apo makrothen* (from afar). The distance he placed between himself and the poor in life is now the unbridgeable chasm in eternity. He is in *basanois* (tortures), the touchstone of reality.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ φω ειπεν πα αβρααμ ελεηϲ με και πεμψον λα ϊνα βαψη το ακρον του δακτυ αυτου ϋδατι και καταψυξη την γλωϲϲαν μου οτι οδυνωμαι εν τη φλογι ταυτη ·

**English Translation**
And he calling out said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazaros that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in pain in this flame.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even in Hell, the rich man remains unchanged. He claims lineage ("Father Abraham") but lacks the works of Abraham. He still views Lazarus as a servant to be dispatched ("send Lazarus"). He who denied crumbs now begs for a drop of water. The *phlogi* (flame) burns the tongue that likely tasted fine wines but spoke no word of charity. He reaps the precise inverse of what he sowed.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ειπ δε αβρααμ μνηϲθη τεκνον οτι απε τα αγαθα ϲου εν τη ζωη ϲου και λαζαροϲ ομοιωϲ τα κακα νυν δε ωδε παρακαλειται ϲυ δε οδυναϲαι

**English Translation**
But Abraham said, "Remember, child, that you received your good things in your life, and Lazarus likewise the bad things; but now here he is comforted, and you are in pain."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrifying equity of divine justice. Abraham uses the tender address *teknon* (child), acknowledging the man's lineage according to the flesh, yet this kinship offers no water for his tongue. The verb *ape* (received) implies a receipt in full; the rich man exhausted his portion of felicity upon the earth. He drained the cup of temporary pleasure, leaving only dregs for eternity. Lazarus, having swallowed the bitter draught of *kaka* (evils) in the flesh, now finds the spiritual reality inverted. The word *hode* (here) marks the immutability of their new state: comfort is not a future hope but a present reality for the beggar, just as agony is for the glutton.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και εν παϲι τουτοιϲ μετα ημων και ϋμ χαϲμα μεγα εϲτη εϲτηριγται οπωϲ οι θε διαβηναι ενθεν προϲ ϋμαϲ μη δυνωνται μη οι εκειθεν προϲ η διαπερωϲιν

**English Translation**
And in all these things, between us and you a great chasm stands fixed, so that those wishing to cross from here to you are not able, nor may those from there cross over to us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the geography of the afterlife, defined by a *chasma mega* (great chasm). The Codex reads *estē estērigtai*—a powerful doubling, perhaps indicating that the gulf not only "stands" but "has been firmly fixed" by divine decree. It is an impassable boundary established by the moral choices made in the body. The will of the spirits (*hoi the[lontes]*, those wishing) is now impotent against the architecture of judgment. There is no traffic between the bosom of the Patriarch and the place of torment; mercy cannot migrate to hell, nor can damnation invade paradise.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ερωτω ουν ϲε πατερ ϊνα πεμψηϲ αυτον ειϲ τον οικον του πατροϲ μου

**English Translation**
And he said, "I ask you therefore, father, that you send him to the house of my father,"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rich man, who once had gatekeepers to bar the poor, now becomes a beggar himself. He uses the word *erōtō* (I ask/beseech), finally learning the language of prayer when it is too late to save himself. His concern shifts to the "house of my father," the locus of his earthly pride and genesis of his error. He seeks to turn Lazarus, whom he ignored in life, into an errand-runner in death. Even in the flames, he retains the mindset of a master expecting service from the lowly, failing to grasp that Lazarus is now seated with princes.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
εχω γαρ πεντε αδελ οπωϲ διαμαρ αυτοιϲ ϊ μη και αυτοι ελθωϲιν ειϲ τον τοπον τουτον τηϲ βαϲανου ˙

**English Translation**
"for I have five brothers; so that he may testify thoroughly to them, in order that they also do not come into this place of torment."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the anguish of a wasted life: the fear that one’s own kin will follow in one’s footsteps. He desires Lazarus to *diamar[tyrētai]* (testify thoroughly/warn) to his five brothers. He calls his abode *topon touton tēs basanou* (this place of torment). He recognizes now that the life of luxury was merely a prelude to this "place of the touchstone," where the soul is tried by fire. He assumes that a specter from the grave possesses more authority than the silent witness of righteousness, betraying his continued ignorance of how faith is truly kindled.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
λεγει δε αβρααμ εχουϲι μω και τουϲ προ ακουϲατω αυτων ˙

**English Translation**
But Abraham says, "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Abraham directs him not to a miracle, but to the Text. *Echousi* (they have) implies present possession; the treasure of salvation is already in their hands in the form of the Law (*Mō[ysea]*) and the Prophets (*Pro[phētas]*). The command *akousatō* (let them hear) establishes the primacy of the ear over the eye in the economy of salvation. If the brothers have ignored the thundering of Sinai and the weeping of Jeremiah, they are deaf to truth itself. The Scripture is sufficient; it requires no authentication from the dead.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ουχι πατερ αβρααμ αλ εαν τιϲ απο νε αναϲτη προϲ αυτουϲ μετανοη

**English Translation**
But he said, "No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead should rise to them, they will repent."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The condemned man dares to correct the Patriarch: *ouchi* (No!). He persists in the carnal delusion that sensory shock induces spiritual change. He believes that *ean tis apo ne[krōn] anastē* (if someone from the dead rises), the sheer terror of the apparitions will force *metanoē[sousin]* (repentance). He mistakes fear for contrition. He imagines that the soul which loves gold more than God can be startled into holiness by a ghost, not understanding that the heart is hardened by habit, not by lack of evidence.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυ ει μωϲεωϲ κ(αι) των προφητων ουκ ακουουϲιν ουδε εαν τιϲ εκ νε αναϲτη πι ˙

**English Translation**
But he said to him, "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the final seal upon the matter. Abraham declares that faith is an obedience of the will to the Word, not a reaction to wonders. If they reject the light of *Mōseōs* (Moses), they are blind. *Oude* (neither) will they be persuaded (*pi* [peisthēsontai]) by a resurrection. This is a prophetic indictment of those who saw the Lord Himself rise from the dead yet bribed the guards to silence the truth. A heart that refuses the Scripture will find a way to explain away even a resurrection. The chasm is fixed not just in the underworld, but in the disposition of the listener.
