**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και αναϲταν απαν το πληθοϲ αυτων ηγαγον αυτον επι τον πιλατον

**English Translation**
And the whole multitude of them, having risen up, led him to Pilate.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the movement of the *plethos* (multitude). The council has finished its dark deliberation, and now, like a swelling wave, they rise (*anastan*) to transfer the Sacred Victim from the religious court to the Gentiles. They lead Him to Pilate, seeking the sword of the state to execute the malice of the sanctuary. It is a procession of doom, where the shepherds of Israel hand over the Lamb to the wolves of Rome, fulfilling the prophecy that the rulers would take counsel together against the Lord.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ηρξαντο δε κατηγο αυτου λεγοντεϲ τουτον ευρομεν διαϲτρεφοντα το εθνοϲ ημων και κωλυοντα φορουϲ καιϲαρι διδοναι και λεγοντα εαυτ εαυτ βαϲιλεα ειναι ·

**English Translation**
And they began to accuse him, saying, "We found this one perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying himself [himself] to be a king."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the triad of lies forged by the accusers. They claim to have "found" (*euromen*) guilt in the Guiltless One. First, they charge Him with *diastrefonta*—twisting or perverting the nation—when He alone makes straight the way of the Lord. Second, they lie concerning the tribute, for He commanded to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. Third, they accuse Him of claiming earthly kingship to incite Roman jealousy. The scribe’s repetition of *eaut* (himself) in the text underscores their obsession with His self-proclamation, yet they understand not the nature of the Kingdom He brings.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε πιλατοϲ ηρω αυτον λεγ λεγ ϲυ ει ο βαϲιλευϲ τ τ ϊουδαιων ο δε α αυτω λεγει ϲυ λεγειϲ

**English Translation**
And Pilate asked him, saying, "Art thou the King of the Jews?" And he, answering him, says, "Thou sayest."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate looks upon the Carpenter and asks of royalty. The text here stammers (*leg leg*, *t t*), perhaps reflecting the hesitation of the scribe or the incredulity of the governor. The Lord’s answer is supreme in its brevity: *Sy legeis* ("Thou sayest"). He does not deny the title, for He is King, yet He does not affirm it in the manner Pilate fears (a military insurrectionist). He throws the weight of the definition back upon the speaker. It is the silence of the Word that speaks louder than the clamor of the priests.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πιλατοϲ ειπ ειπ προϲ τουϲ αρχϊεριϲ και τουϲ οχλουϲ ουδεν ευριϲκω αιτιον εν τω αν τουτω

**English Translation**
And Pilate said to the high priests and the crowds, "I find no fault in this man."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the verdict of the Gentile conscience, unclouded by the envy that blinds the Sanhedrin. Pilate declares *ouden euriskō aition*—I find no cause, no guilt. He speaks to the *archiereis* (high priests) and the *ochlous* (crowds), standing as a witness against them. The pagan judge acquits the Just One, while the chosen people condemn Him. It is a profound inversion of order, showing that the law written on the heart of the heathen may sometimes see clearer than the law read without the Spirit.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
οι δε επιϲχυον λεγ λεγ οτι αναϲι αναϲιει τον οχλον διδαϲκ καθ οληϲ τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ και αρξαμενοϲ απο τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ εωϲ ωδε

**English Translation**
But they insisted, saying that "He stirs up the crowd, teaching throughout the whole of Judea, and having begun from Galilee even to here."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The acquittal enrages them; they "insisted" (*epischyon*—grew strong/urgent). They accuse Him of *anaseiei*—shaking up or stirring the people. Note that His crime is "teaching" (*didask*). The Light of the World teaches, and the darkness calls it sedition. They trace His path from Galilee to Judea, unwittingly testifying to the scope of His evangelism. They mean to show the breadth of the contagion; they actually confess the breadth of the Gospel's reach.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
πειλατοϲ δε ακου επηρωτηϲεν ει ο ανθρωποϲ γα εϲτιν

**English Translation**
But Pilate, hearing [it], asked if the man is a Galilean.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mention of Galilee offers Pilate a political escape. He seizes upon the word. The text abbreviates "Galilean" (*ga*), reflecting the haste of the proceedings. Pilate seeks not truth, but jurisdiction. If the Man belongs to another's authority, Pilate hopes to wash his hands of the blood before it is even shed. It is the maneuver of the bureaucrat who fears the mob more than he fears the gods.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και επιγνουϲ οτι εκ τηϲ εξουϲιαϲ ηρω εϲτιν ανεπεμ αυτον προϲ η οντα κα αυτον και αυτον και αυτον εν ϊεροϲο εν αυταιϲ ταυταιϲ ταιϲ ημεραιϲ

**English Translation**
And knowing that he is from the jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him up to Herod, who was also himself [himself himself] in Jerusalem in these very days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate acknowledges Herod's *exousias* (authority/jurisdiction). The text suffers from extreme agitation here (*ka auton kai auton kai auton*), as if the scribe stumbles over the convergence of these powers. Christ is sent "up" (*anepem*) to Herod. Providence has arranged that the fox Herod is in Jerusalem for the feast. Thus, the Kings of the earth—Roman and Idumean—gather against the Lord's Anointed, fulfilling the Psalm. The Lamb is passed from wolf to fox.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ο δε η ϊδων τον εχαρη λιαν ην γαρ εξ ϊκανων χρο θελων αυτον δια το ακου περι αυτου κ(αι) ηλπιζε ηλπιζεν τι ϲημι ϊδιν ϋπ αυτου γεινομενον

**English Translation**
And Herod, seeing Jesus, rejoiced greatly; for he was of a long time wanting [to see] him because of hearing concerning him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herod's joy (*echarē*) is profane and superficial. He desires not salvation, but a spectacle. He has heard rumors and hopes for a *sēmi* (sign/miracle) as one hopes for a magician's trick. This is the danger of curiosity without reverence. He sees the Incarnate God and thinks only of entertainment. The text notes he had been waiting a "long time" (*ikanōn chro*), yet his patience was that of a predator, not a disciple.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ε δε αυτον εν λογοιϲ ϊκανοιϲ αυτοϲ δε ουκ απε απεκρινατο αυτω

**English Translation**
And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herod pours out "many words" (*logois ikanois*), a torrent of idle interrogation. Against this babble stands the majestic silence of the Word. *Ouk apekrinato*—He answered him nothing. Jesus speaks to the broken-hearted, and even to the vacillating Pilate, but to the mocker who killed the Forerunner (John), He offers no voice. Silence is the only judgment fit for the one who seeks miracles to satisfy his lust for amusement.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ϊϲτηκειϲαν δε οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι γραμματειϲ ευ κατηγορο αυτου

**English Translation**
And the high priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While Christ is silent, the accusers are vociferous. They "stood" (*istēkeisan*)—a posture of rigid hostility. The adverb *eu* (likely *eutonōs*, vehemently/stoutly) modifies their accusation. They fear Herod might release Him or be amused by Him, so they press their charges with intensity. The contrast is stark: the calm silence of the Judge of the World, surrounded by the screaming chaos of the religious elite.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
εξουθενηϲαϲ τε αυτ και ο ηρωδηϲ ϲυν τοιϲ ϲτρατευμαϲιν αυτου και ενπε περιβαλων αιϲθητα λαμπρ λαμπρ επεμψεν ανεπεμψεν αυτον τω πιλατω ·

**English Translation**
And Herod with his soldiers, having set him at nought and mocked him, putting around [him] a splendid robe, sent him back to Pilate.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herod, denied his miracle, turns to mockery. *Exouthenēsas*—he treated Him as nothing, set Him at nought. They clothe Him in a *lampr* (bright/splendid) garment, mocking His claim to kingship. The scribe repeats *lampr lampr*, emphasizing the garish nature of the robe. This is the "white raiment" of a fool or a candidate, used here to humiliate the King of Glory. Herod sends Him back (*anepempsen*), having found Him to be a fool rather than a threat, adding scorn to the rejection.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
εγεν εγεν δε φιλοι ο τε η και ο πιλα εν αυτη τη ημε μετ αλληλων προ προ γαρ εν εχθρα οντεϲ προϲ αυτουϲ ·

**English Translation**
And they became friends, both Herod and Pilate, on that very day with one another; for they were before at enmity between themselves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter of the trial concludes with a perverse reconciliation. Herod and Pilate, formerly enemies (*echthra*), are made friends (*philoi*) through their mutual rejection of Christ. The world finds unity in its hatred of the Truth. The scribe’s stuttering (*egen egen*, *pro pro*) marks the strangeness of this alliance. The bond of iniquity is forged over the body of the Innocent One; the peace of the world is often built upon the persecution of the Church.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
‾̷‾ πι δε ϲυνκαλε τουϲ αρ και τουϲ αρ και τον λα

**English Translation**
[Pilate] then, having called together the [rulers] and the [rulers] and the people...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the gathering of the storm. The text presents `πι` (Pilate) convening the powers of the world. The scribe has curiously repeated `τουϲ αρ` (the rulers/archons), perhaps an error of the hand, or perhaps, as we discern spiritually, an emphasis on the multiplicity of authorities arrayed against the Lord—both the spiritual rulers of the Jews and the temporal rulers of the state. They summon `τον λα` (the people), ensuring that the guilt of the Deicide is shared by the shepherd and the flock alike.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν προϲ αυ προϲηνεγ μοι τον ανθρω τουτον ωϲ αποϲτρεφοντα τον λαον και ϊδου εγω ενωπιον ϋ ανακριναϲ ουθεν ευρον εν τω ανθρωπω του αιτιον ων κα αυτου

**English Translation**
He said to them: You brought to me this man as turning away the people, and behold, I, having examined [him] before you, found nothing in this man [as] cause [of guilt] of which you accuse him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Hear the verdict of the Gentile judge! Pilate declares `ουθεν ευρον`—I found nothing. The charge is that Christ is `αποϲτρεφοντα` (turning away/perverting) the people, yet the Truth cannot pervert; it only redirects the soul from error to God. Pilate examines Him `ενωπιον ϋ` (before you), making them witnesses to the Lord's innocence. The `αιτιον` (cause/crime) is absent, for in the Sinless One, there is no hook for the accusation to catch.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ουδε ηρωδηϲ ανεπεμψε γαρ αυ προϲ ημαϲ κ(αι) ο̣ ϊδου ουδεν αξιον θανατου εϲτιν πεπραγμενον αυτω

**English Translation**
But neither Herod; for he sent him back to us, and behold, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The testimony is doubled. Not only the Roman, but the Idumean fox, Herod, finds no fault. The phrase `πεπραγμενον αυτω` (done by him) is in the perfect passive; the Lord’s life is a completed work of innocence. Even the eyes of the world, clouded by sin, cannot fabricate a `θανατου` (death) sentence that holds weight. The world judges its Creator and finds Him innocent, yet kills Him still.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
παιδευϲαϲ ουν αυτον απο

**English Translation**
Having chastised him therefore, [I will] release [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the failure of worldly justice. If He is innocent, why `παιδευϲαϲ` (chastise/discipline) Him? Pilate seeks a compromise with iniquity, offering the blood of the scourge to satisfy the thirst for the blood of the Cross. The text breaks off at `απο` (release), as if the very act of release is cut short by the will of the mob.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
αναγκην δε ειχεν απολυειν αυτοιϲ κατα εορτην ινα ενα

**English Translation**
And he had a necessity to release to them at the feast [so that] one...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The `αναγκην` (necessity) binds the judge. It is a custom of the feast, a shadow of the true Pascha where the prisoner is set free. But observe the irony: they seek the release of the guilty by the binding of the Innocent. The text here is fragmentary (`ινα ενα`), pointing to the singular choice: one must go free, one must die.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ανεκραγον δε παν λεγοντεϲ αιρε τουτον απο δε ημιν τ βαραββαν

**English Translation**
But they cried out all [together] saying: Take this one away, and release to us Barabbas.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The terrible exchange. `αιρε τουτον` (Take this one away/Lift him up)—unwittingly, they prophesy His lifting up on the Cross. They prefer `βαραββαν` (Barabbas), whose name means "Son of the Father," rejecting the true Son of the Father. The crowd demands the release of the destroyer of life and the destruction of the Giver of Life.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
οϲτιϲ δια ϲταϲιν τινα γε εν τη πολει και φονον βεβλημενοϲ βεβλημενοϲ εν τη φυλακη

**English Translation**
Who on account of a certain sedition occurring in the city and murder had been thrown [thrown] in the prison.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The character of the chosen one is laid bare: `ϲταϲιν` (sedition/uprising) and `φονον` (murder). The repetition of `βεβλημενοϲ` (thrown/cast) by the scribe emphasizes the depth of his fall; he is cast down into the prison, a symbol of the sinner bound by Satan. The people choose the murderer, showing they are children of the murderer from the beginning (John 8:44).

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
παλιν δε ο πιλατοϲ προϲεφωνηϲεν αυτοιϲ θελων α τον

**English Translation**
But again Pilate called out to them, wishing to [release] the [Jesus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate persists, `θελων` (wishing/willing) to save Him. He `προϲεφωνηϲεν` (called out to) them, raising his voice against the madness. But the will of a weak ruler cannot stand against the divine economy which demands the Sacrifice. The text is truncated (`α τον`), leaving the object of his release unspoken, just as his intent remains unfulfilled.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
οι δε επεφωνο επεφωνο λεγοντεϲ ϲταυρου ϲταυρου αυτον

**English Translation**
But they shouted [shouted] saying: Crucify, crucify him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers with the violence of the mob: `επεφωνο επεφωνο` (shouted upon/shouted upon). This dittography mirrors the double imperative `ϲταυρου ϲταυρου` (crucify, crucify). They do not merely ask for death; they demand the curse of the tree. It is a chant of hell rising to drown out the voice of reason.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ο δε τριτον ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ τι γαρ κακον εποιηϲεν ουτοϲ ουδεν αιτι αξιον αιτιον θανατου ευρ εν αυτω παιδευϲαϲ ουν αυτον απολυϲω

**English Translation**
But he said a third time to them: For what evil did this one do? I found no cause worthy [cause] of death in him; having chastised him therefore, I will release [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Three times (`τριτον`) the Gentile declares Him innocent, perfecting the witness. The question `τι γαρ κακον` (for what evil?) hangs in the air, unanswered throughout history. The scribe stumbles again (`αιτι αξιον αιτιον`), perhaps trembling at the text, underlining that there is absolutely no *cause* for this death other than the love of God for man. Pilate returns to his weak compromise: chastisement and release.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
οι δε εκειντο φω μεγαλαιϲ αι αυτον ϲταυρωθηναι κ(αι) κατϊϲχυον αι φω αυτων

**English Translation**
But they were insistent with loud voices asking for him to be crucified; and their voices prevailed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They `εκειντο` (pressed upon/lay upon) him. The `φω μεγαλαιϲ` (great voices) are the weapons of the mob. The verb `κατϊϲχυον` (prevailed/overpowered) signifies a conquest. The voices of men overpower the voice of conscience. It is not justice that wins, but volume and violence.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και πιλατοϲ επε γενεϲθαι το αιτημα αυτ

**English Translation**
And Pilate adjudged their request to be done.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final collapse. Pilate `επε` (gave sentence/adjudged) not according to law, but `γενεϲθαι το αιτημα αυτ` (that their request be done). The judge becomes the executioner of the mob's will. He surrenders the Authority given to him from above to the chaos from below. The `αιτημα` (request/demand) of the creature supersedes the rights of the Creator.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
απελυϲεν δε τον δια ϲταϲιν και φο βεβλημεν ειϲ φυλακην ον ητουντο τον δε παρεδωκεν τω θεληματι αυτ

**English Translation**
But he released the one who on account of sedition and mur[der] had been cast into prison whom they asked for, but the [Jesus] he handed over to their will.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the terrible exchange that defines the world's judgment. The text reads *pho*—a fragment of *phonon* (murder)—indicating the violent nature of the one released. Barabbas, the man of sedition, is set free, while the Prince of Peace is surrendered. Pilate hands Him over not to justice, but *to themati aut[on]*—to their will. When the will of the mob supersedes the will of God in the hearts of men, the innocent are devoured.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και ωϲ απηγαγον αυτον επιλαβο ϲιμωνα τινα κυρηναιον ερχομενον απ α επεθηκεν επεθηκαν αυτω τον ϲταυρ α̣ι̣ρε φερε οπιϲθεν του

**English Translation**
And as they led him away, having laid hold of Simon a certain Cyrenian coming from [the field], he placed—they placed upon him the cross to lift [and] bear behind the [Jesus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the scribal hesitation in the Codex: *epetheken epethekan* (he placed, they placed). It is as if the text itself stammers at the weight of the wood. Simon is compelled to *aire* (lift) and *phere* (carry). But the crucial instruction for all disciples is found in the final words: *opisthen tou*—behind the [Jesus]. We cannot bear the cross before Him, nor beside Him as equals, but only following after, where He has already trodden the path of suffering.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ηκολουθει δε αυ πολυ πληθοϲ του λαου και γυ εκοπτ και εθρηνουν αυτον

**English Translation**
And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of wom[en] [who] were beating [their breasts] and lamenting him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates *gunaikwn* (women) to *gy*, yet their grief is not shortened. The verb *ekopt* implies a violent striking; they beat their breasts in rhythm with the tragedy. While the multitude follows perhaps out of curiosity, these women follow out of a sorrow that manifests in the flesh. It is a mourning that precedes the death, a prophetic lamentation for the Life that is about to be extinguished.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ϲτραφειϲ δε προϲ αυταϲ ο ει θυγατεραιϲ ϊ μη κλαιετε επ εμε πλην εφ εαυταϲ κλαιετε και επι τα τεκνα ϋμων

**English Translation**
But having turned toward them, the [Jesus] [said], Daughters of J[erusalem], do not weep for me; rather weep for yourselves and for your children.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even in the extremity of His passion, the Lord turns (*strapheis*) to minister. He addresses them as Daughters of *I[erousalem]*, linking them to the city that kills the prophets. He redirects their tears. To weep for God is piety; to weep for the judgment coming upon one's own sin and city is necessity. He sees the sword that will pierce the soul of the nation, a calamity greater than His own physical death.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
οτι ϊδου ημεραι ερχονται εν αιϲ ε μακαριαι ϲτειραι και αι κοι αι ουκ εγεννη και μαϲτοι οι ουκ εθρεψαν

**English Translation**
For behold, days are coming in which [they will say], Blessed are barren women and the wom[bs] which did not bear and breasts which did not nourish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the inversion of the natural order. In the Old Covenant, barrenness was a curse and a reproach; under the shadow of the coming wrath, it becomes a beatitude. The *koi[liai]* (wombs) that are empty are spared the agony of birthing children for the slaughter. The Lord prophesies the siege where life itself becomes a burden too heavy to bear.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
το αρξονται λεγε τοιϲ ορεϲιν πεϲε πεϲατε εφ ημαϲ και τοιϲ βουνοιϲ κα ημαϲ

**English Translation**
Th[en] they will begin to s[ay] to the mountains, Fall—Fall upon us, and to the hills, Co[ver] us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes *pese pesate*—a shift from singular to plural imperative, or a cry repeated: "Fall! Fall!" This urgency reflects the terror of the sinner facing the face of God. They prefer the crushing weight of mountains to the crushing weight of divine judgment. They seek to be *ka[lupsate]* (covered) by earth because they refused to be covered by grace.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
οτι ει εν τω υγρω ξυ ξυλω ξυλω ταυτα ποιουϲ εν τω ξηρω τι γε

**English Translation**
For if in the green woo—wood—wood they do these things, in the dry what [will happen]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the stutter in the sacred text: *xy xylo xylo* (woo-wood-wood). The scribe's hand trembles, or perhaps emphasizes the instrument of death. The "green wood" is Christ, full of the sap of life, fruitful and innocent. The "dry" is Jerusalem, withered in faith. If the Romans ignite the green wood which naturally resists fire, how fiercely will the dry wood burn when the spark of judgment lands?

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ηγοντο δε και ετε κακουργοι δυο ϲυν αυτω αναιρε

**English Translation**
And there were led also oth[er] malefactors, two, with him to be execut[ed].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He is numbered among the transgressors. The text calls them *kakourgoi* (evil-workers). There is no distinction made in the procession; the Holy One is wedged between the profane. *Anaire[thenai]* (to be taken away/killed) applies to all three. The world sees three criminals; faith sees the King accompanied by the subjects of His judgment and mercy.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και οτε ηλθον επι τον τοπον τον κα κρανι εκει εϲταυρω αυτον και τουϲ κακουργουϲ ον μεν εκ δεξι ον δε εξ αριϲτερ

**English Translation**
And when they came to the place the [one] cal[led] Skul[l], there they crucified him and the malefactors, one on the right and one on the left.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The place is *Krani[on]* (Skull), a place of death's dominion. *Ekei* (There)—in that specific locus of horror—they crucified Him. The geometry of salvation is drawn here: the Savior in the center, flanked by the two responses of humanity to God—rejection and repentance. He hangs in the midst, the mediator even in the geography of the cross.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ελεγεν πατερ αφεϲ αυτοιϲ ου γαρ οιδαϲιν τι ποιου ο δε ι ελεγεν πατερ αφεϲ αυτοιϲ ου γαρ οιδαϲιν τι ποιουϲιν διαμεριζομενοι δε τα ϊματια αυτου εβαλον κληρον

**English Translation**
But he was saying, Father forgive them, for they know not what they d[o]—But the J[esus] was saying, Father forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. And dividing his garments they cast a lot.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery in the manuscript: the prayer is written, seemingly abandoned at *poiou*, and then written again fully with the Nomina Sacra *I[esous]*. It is as if the scribe feared to record such impossible mercy, or the text insists on doubling the intercession. While He prays for their souls, they play games for His tunic. The repetition of the prayer in the text serves to etch it deeper into our hearts: He forgives the ignorance that murders Him.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και ϊϲτηκει ο λαοϲ θεωρων εξεμυκτηριζον δε οι αρχοντεϲ λε αλλουϲ εϲω ϲωϲατω εαυ ει ουτοϲ εϲτ ο ο του ο εκ

**English Translation**
And the people stood watching. But the rulers were sneering, sa[ying], Others he sa[ved]; let him save him[self], if this is the Ch[rist] of G[od], the Cho[sen].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The people merely watch (*theoron*), paralyzed by the spectacle. But the rulers engage in *exemykterizon*—literally, "turning up the nose." Their mockery contains the highest truths spoken in irony: "Others he saved." Indeed. And because He saves others, He cannot save Himself. They name Him *Ch[ristos]* and *Ek[lektos]* (Chosen), titles they spit out, but which the Father confirms in the silence of the heavens.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ενεπεξαν δε αυτω οι ϲτρατιωται προϲ οξοϲ προϲφεροντεϲ αυτω

**English Translation**
And the soldiers mocked him, [coming] to [him], offering vinegar to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mockery descends from the spiritual rulers to the brute soldiers. They offer *oxos*—sour wine or vinegar. It is a parody of service, a twisted hospitality. They bring the cheapest wine to the King of Glory. Yet, He drinks the cup the Father has given Him, of which this vinegar is but a physical symbol of the bitterness of sin He now tastes for all men.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
και λεγοντεϲ ει ϲυ ει ο βαϲιλευϲ των ϊουδαιων ϲωϲον ϲεαυτον

**English Translation**
And saying: "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the devil’s ancient strategy, repeated now by the soldiers. Just as in the wilderness the tempter said, "If you are the Son of God," so here the world challenges the Lord with a conditional "If." They misunderstand the nature of Divine Kingship; they imagine a king is one who preserves his own life at all costs, whereas the true King is He who lays down His life for the subjects. They mock Him for not saving Himself, unaware that by refusing to save Himself, He is saving them.

**Verse 38**


**Greek Text**
ην δε και επιγραφη επ αυτω γραμμα ελληνικοιϲ ρωμαικοιϲ εβραι γραμμαϲιν ελληνικοιϲ ρωμαικοιϲ εβραικοιϲ ο βαϲιλευϲ τ ϊουδαιων ουτοϲ

**English Translation**
Now there was also an inscription over him [in] letters Greek, Roman, Hebrew, letters Greek, Roman, Hebrew: "The King of the Jews [is] this one."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text before us contains a repetition, emphasizing twice the tongues of the world: Greek for wisdom, Roman for power, Hebrew for religion. Pilate’s inscription, though meant as an accusation, serves as a universal prophecy. It is written in every language so that no nation might plead ignorance. "This one"—this crucified flesh—is the Monarch of the ages. The stumbling of the scribe in repeating the languages only underscores the urgency that this truth be read by all.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
ειϲ δε των κρεμα κακουρ εβλαϲφημι αυτον λεγων ουχϊ ϲυ ει ο ϲω ϲεαυτον και ημαϲ ˙

**English Translation**
But one of the hanged evildoers blasphemed him, saying: "Are you not the Savior? Save yourself and us."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The blasphemy of this thief lies in his demand for a carnal salvation. He uses the title "Savior" (indicated by the contraction *ϲω*) not as a confession of faith, but as a challenge to Christ’s powerlessness. He desires to be taken down from the cross, not to be lifted up to God. He represents those who seek Christ only for the alleviation of temporary suffering, despising the fellowship of His passion.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ετεροϲ επιτι αυτω εφη ου ουδε φοβη ϲυ τον οτι εν τω αυτω κριματι ει

**English Translation**
But answering, the other, rebuking him, said: "Do you not even fear [God], because you are in the same condemnation?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the beginning of repentance: the fear of God. While the first thief looks only at the man on the cross next to him, the second looks upward to the judgment of the Almighty. To be in the "same condemnation" refers to the physical penalty of death, yet this thief recognizes that while their punishment is shared, their moral standing is infinitely apart. He preaches from the wood, becoming a theologian amidst agony.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
και η μεν δικαιωϲ αξια γαρ ων επρα απολαμ ουτοϲ δε ουδεν ατοπον επραξεν

**English Translation**
"And we indeed justly, for we receive things worthy of what we did; but this one did nothing out of place."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the perfect confession: the admission of personal guilt and the proclamation of Christ’s innocence. He declares that Christ has done nothing *atopon*—nothing "out of place" or amiss. In a world turned upside down by sin, only the Holy One is truly "in place," aligned perfectly with the Father's will. The thief justifies the Judge, and in doing so, is justified by Him.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και ελεγ τω μνηϲθητι μου οταν ελθηϲ εν τη βαϲιλια ϲου

**English Translation**
And he said to [him]: "Remember me when you come into your kingdom."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Great is the faith of this robber! He sees a man dying in shame, naked and bleeding, yet he perceives a King entering His glory. He does not ask for the cross to be removed, but to be remembered within the Kingdom that the cross inaugurates. "Remember me" is the cry of the lowly; he asks only for a place in the memory of God, which is life itself.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ειπεν αυτω α λεγω ϲοι ϲη μετ εμου εϲη εν τω παρα

**English Translation**
And he said to him: "Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in the Paradise."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord answers with royal authority. "Today"—the immediacy of salvation. There is no delay for the contrite heart. He promises "Paradise," the garden of delight lost by Adam, now reopened by the Second Adam. The thief asked only to be remembered in the future, but Christ grants him presence in the present. To be "with me" is the very definition of Paradise; where Christ is, there is the Kingdom.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
και ην ωρα ωϲει ε και ϲκοτοϲ εγε εφ ολην τ γην εωϲ ωραϲ ε

**English Translation**
And it was about the fifth hour, and darkness came upon the whole earth until the fifth hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here presents a mystery, reading the "fifth" hour (*epsilon*) where we might expect the sixth. We accept the reading as it stands in this witness: a time of darkness enveloping the creation. The sun hides its face, unable to look upon the Sun of Righteousness suffering in the flesh. The repetition of the hour suggests a fixed period of mourning by the cosmos itself, a suspension of natural light while the Light of the World descends into death.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
του ηλιου εκλιποντοϲ εϲχιϲθη δε το κα του ναου μεϲον

**English Translation**
The sun failing; and the veil of the temple was torn in the middle.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eclipse of the physical sun signals the end of the shadow of the Law. The veil (*katapetasma*), which barred man from the Holy of Holies, is rent not from the bottom by men, but in the midst, signifying a divine act. The separation between God and man is abolished. The mysteries of the old temple are exposed and made obsolete, for the true Temple is now being sacrificed on Golgotha.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
και φωνηϲαϲ φω μεγαλη ο ειπεν πατερʼ ειϲ χιραϲ ϲου παρατιθεμαι το π μου τουτο δε ειπων εξε

**English Translation**
And calling out with a great voice, [he] said: "Father, into your hands I commend my Spirit." And saying this, he expired.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He dies not by the exhaustion of nature, but by the command of His will. He cries with a "great voice" to show that He retains His power even in death. He "commends" (*paratithemai*) His Spirit—a deposit entrusted to the Father. This is the death of the High Priest offering the final oblation. He "expired" (*exepneusen*), breathing out the Spirit that He might later breathe it upon the Church.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ο εκατ εκατ το γενο εδοξα τον λεγ οτι οντωϲ ο αν ουτοϲ δικαιοϲ ην

**English Translation**
Now the centurion, seeing what happened, glorified [God], saying that: "Really this man was righteous."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Gentile soldier becomes the first convert of the cross. Seeing the manner of His death—the earthquake, the cry, the dignity—he glorifies God. The verdict of Rome ("righteous") overturns the verdict of Jerusalem ("guilty"). This "righteous one" (*dikaios*) is the fulfillment of the prophets, recognized not by the scholars of the Law, but by a man of war whose heart was pierced by the truth.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
και παντεϲ οι ϲυν οχλοι ειϲ την θε ταυτην θε τα γε τυπτον τα ϲτηθη ϋπε ·

**English Translation**
And all the crowds who came together for this spectacle, watching the things that happened, beating the breasts, returned.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They came for a "spectacle" (*theōrian*), to gaze upon suffering with curiosity, but they leave beating their breasts in dread and compunction. The sight of the Lord’s death transforms the mob into mourners. They "returned" (*hypestrephon*), turning back not just to their homes, but perhaps turning back in their hearts. The cross has begun its work of drawing all men unto Him, striking the conscience of the world.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
ειϲτηκιϲαν δε π οι γνωϲτοι αυ απο μακροθ και γυναικεϲ αι ϲυνακολουθου αυτω απο τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ ορωϲαι ταυτα

**English Translation**
But all those known to Him stood from afar, and women who followed Him from Galilee, seeing these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the posture of the faithful remnant. The text reads *eistēkisan* (they stood), a station of immobility amidst the chaos of the Passion. Who are these? *Hoi gnōstoi autō* (those known to Him)—not merely acquaintances, but those intimately perceived by the Lord. They stand *apo makrothen* (from afar); fear or reverence holds them at a distance, yet love tethers them to the sight. The women, too, who shared the long road *apo tēs Galilaias* (from Galilee), are witnesses. They are *horōsai tauta* (seeing these things); their eyes drink in the mystery of the slaughter, ensuring that the death is a testified reality, not a phantasm.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ανηρ ονο ϊωϲηφ βου ϋπαρχ και ανηρ αγαθοϲ και δικαιοϲ

**English Translation**
And behold, a man named Joseph, being a councillor, and a good and righteous man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the very seat of judgment, God preserves a witness. *Idou* (Behold), a man named Joseph. The Codex identifies his rank: *bouleutēs hyparchōn* (being a councillor). Yet, his dignity is not in his office, but in his character: *anēr agathos kai dikaios* (a man good and righteous). It is rare to find goodness allied with power, or righteousness within the Sanhedrin that condemned the Just One. He stands as a lily among thorns, proving that rank does not necessitate corruption if the heart remains tethered to the Law of God.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ ουκ ην ϲυνκατα τη βου και τη πραξει αυτων απο αρι πολε των ϊουδαι οϲ προϲεδε την βαϲιλει του

**English Translation**
This one was not consenting to their counsel and their deed; [he was] from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was awaiting the kingdom of the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the proof of his righteousness: dissent. *Outos ouk ēn synkatatetheimenos* (This one was not consenting). He rejected both the *boulē* (counsel/plan) and the *praxei* (deed) of the conspirators. He is anchored in *Arimathea*, a city of the Jews, but his eyes are fixed on a higher polity. The text says he *prosedekheto* (was awaiting) the *basileian tou* [Theou] (Kingdom of the [God]). While others sought to preserve their earthly place by killing the Heir, Joseph awaited the Kingdom by honoring the King's corpse. His expectation of God's reign gave him the courage to defy the council of men.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ προϲελθων τω πιλατω ητηϲα το ϲωμα του ˙

**English Translation**
This one, having approached Pilate, asked for the body of the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the boldness of the righteous man. *Proselthōn* (having approached) the Gentile governor, he makes his petition. He does not ask for gold or favor, but *ētēsato to sōma* (asked for the body). The body of the Lord, now a lifeless weight to the world, is a treasure to the faithful. The scribe finishes the verse with *tou* and a high dot, implying the sacred name (of Jesus/of the Lord) or simply "His body." Joseph claims the Temple of God which men had destroyed, intending to treat it with the reverence denied by the priests.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
και καθελων ενε αυτο ϲιν και εθηκεν αυτον εν μνημα λαξευτω ου ου ην ουδειϲ ουδε κειμενοϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having taken [it] down, he wrapped it in linen, and placed him in a hewn tomb where no one was yet lying.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Deposition is an act of supreme tenderness. *Kathelōn* (having taken down) the burden from the wood, he performs the priestly duty of the new covenant. He wrapped it *sindoni* (in linen)—the pure vestment for the Sleeping King. He lays Him *en mnēmati laxeutō* (in a hewn tomb), cut from rock. The Codex specifies the purity of this resting place: *ou oupō ēn oudeis keimenos* (where not yet was no one lying). As the Lord was born from a virgin womb which no man had opened, so He is laid in a virgin tomb where no corpse had rotted. Newness befits the Author of Life even in death.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
και ημερα ην παρα και ϲαββα επεφωϲκ

**English Translation**
And it was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was dawning.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The timing is inscribed with theological weight. It was *hēmera paraskeuēs* (the day of Preparation). The great work of redemption is finished on the sixth day, mirroring the first creation. Now, *sabbaton epephōsken* (the Sabbath was dawning/shining forth). The verb *epephōsken* suggests the lighting of lamps or the arrival of the holy time. The Lord enters the Great Sabbath rest in the tomb, ceasing from His labor of suffering, just as God rested on the seventh day. The silence of the grave commences the true Sabbath.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
κατακολουθηϲα δε γυναικεϲ αιτινεϲ ηϲαν ϲυ ϲ εκ τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ αυ εθεαϲαντο το μνημιον και ωϲ ετεθη το ϲωμα αυ

**English Translation**
And having followed after, the women who were come with Him from Galilee saw the tomb and how His body was laid.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vigilance of the women continues. *Katakolouthēsasai* (having followed down/after), these faithful souls—who *ēsan synelēlythyiai* (were come together) with Him from Galilee—do not abandon Him at the stone. They *etheasanto* (beheld) the tomb. They scrutinized *hōs etethē* (how it was placed). This is not idle curiosity but the diligence of love; they must know the exact place to return with their spices. Their eyes are the bridge between the Burial and the Resurrection; they witness the reality of the death so they may later witness the reality of the Life.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
ϋποϲτρεψαϲαι δε η αρωμα και μυρα και το μεν ϲαββατον η κατα τ τ εντολην

**English Translation**
And having returned, they [prepared] spices and ointments. And on the Sabbath they [rested] according to the commandment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the tension between devotion and obedience. *Hypostrepsasai* (having returned), they prepared *arōmata kai myra* (spices and myrrh) to anoint the dead, an act of piety. Yet, the Law of Moses holds sway: *to men sabbaton hēsychasan* (on the Sabbath they rested). They ceased their work *kata tēn entolēn* (according to the commandment). Even in their grief, they submit to the Law, waiting for the sun to rise on the first day. They rest in silence, unaware that the Lord of the Sabbath is destroying death from within that very silence.
