**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ηγγιζεν δε η εορτη των αζυμων η λεγομενη παϲχα

**English Translation**
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, the one called Passover.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the convergence of times. The Evangelist does not merely mark a date but signals a theological collision. The "unleavened bread"—symbol of haste and purity, of purging the old leaven of malice—draws near to the "Passover," the ancient memorial of blood shielding the faithful from the Destroyer. Here, the shadow prepares to give way to the Substance; the type approaches the Archetype. The feast "draws near," and with it, the hour of the true Lamb.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και εζητουν οι αρ και οι γραμ το πωϲ ανε αυτον εφο γαρ τον λα ·

**English Translation**
And the chief [priests] and the scribes were seeking the 'how' they might destroy him; for they feared the people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the cowardice of power. The text abbreviates their titles (*ar* for *archiereis*, *gram* for *grammateis*), just as their moral stature is diminished by fear. They seek not justice, but a method (*to pos*) of destruction (*ane* for *anelosin*). They fear the *laon* (people), yet they do not fear God. It is a conspiracy of the learned and the holy against the Truth itself, paralyzed only by the gaze of the multitude, proving that their authority rests on human acclaim, not divine sanction.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ειϲηλθεν δε ϲατα ειϲ ϊουδαν τ τ καλουμενον ϊϲ οντα εκ του αριθμου τ τ δωδεκα

**English Translation**
And Satan entered into Judas, the one called Is[cariot], being of the number of the twelve.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Tremble at this mystery of iniquity. The Adversary (*sata* for *satanas*) finds a breach within the fortress of the Apostles. The text emphasizes his identity: "of the number of the twelve." Proximity to the Light does not guarantee illumination if the heart remains open to darkness. The abbreviation *Is* (for Iscariot) stands starkly; he who bore the name of praise (Judah) now bears the specific mark of the traitor. The enemy does not attack from without, but enters (*eiselthen*) within.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και απελθων ϲυ ϲ τοιϲ αρχϊερευϲιν και ϲτρατηγοιϲ το πωϲ αυτοιϲ παραδω αυ

**English Translation**
And having gone away, he conferred with the chief priests and captains [about] the 'how' he might betray him to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mechanics of betrayal require a departure; he must "go away" (*apelthon*) from the Lord to commune with His enemies. He confers (*sy s* for *synelalesen*) with both the religious authorities and the *strategois* (captains of the temple guard). Spiritual malice allies with military force. The subject of their council is again "the how" (*to pos*)—the logistics of handing over (*parado*) the Author of Life.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και εχαρηϲαν και ϲυνεθεντο αυ αργυριον δου

**English Translation**
And they rejoiced and agreed to give him silver.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the perverse joy (*echaresan*) of the wicked. The prospect of destroying the Just One brings gladness to those who should be the guardians of justice. They covenant to give *argyrion* (silver)—a price for the Priceless. It is a transaction of souls: they buy blood, and Judas sells his eternity. The agreement is swift, for evil finds quick consensus when the target is righteousness.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) εξωμολογηϲεν και εζητει ευ του παρα αυτον α οχλου αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And he consented, and sought an opportunity to betray him to them apart from [the] crowd.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He "consented" (*exomologesen*)—a word often used for confession of praise or sin, here twisted into a pact of doom. Now he seeks the *eu* (*eukairian*), the "good time" or opportunity. Note the condition: *a ochlou* (*ater ochlou*)—"apart from the crowd." Darkness hates the light of public scrutiny. The betrayal must happen in the shadows, in the quiet places where the Lord prays, away from the *ochlos* who hung upon His words.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ηλθεν δε η ημερα των αζυμων ε η εδει θυεϲθαι το παϲχα

**English Translation**
Then came the day of unleavened bread on which it was necessary [for] the passover to be sacrificed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The temporal narrative resumes with divine necessity. It was the day *e h* (*en he*, on which) it was *edei*—"necessary." This necessity is not merely ritual custom but theological destiny. The Passover *must* be sacrificed. The ancient law demands a lamb; the new dispensation provides The Lamb. The history of Israel converges on this single day where the type must bleed to unveil the Antitype.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και απε πετρον και ϊωαννην ει πορευθεν ετοιμαϲατε η το παϲχα ϊνα φαγωμεν

**English Translation**
And he sent Peter and John, saying, "Having gone, prepare for us the passover that we may eat."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord initiates the rite. He sends (*ape* for *apesteilen*) the two pillars, Peter and John—faith and love, action and contemplation. The command is to "prepare" (*hetoimasate*). Even the Lord of Glory submits to the preparation of the feast, teaching us that the mysteries of God require our active service and readiness. He says "for us" (*h* for *hemin*), including Himself in the community of the meal, though He alone is the food.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ει αυτω που θε ετοιμαϲωμ ετοιμαϲωμ

**English Translation**
And they said to him, "Where do you wish [that] we prepare?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples display the docility of true servants. They do not presume the location of the mystery. They ask "Where?" (*pou*), acknowledging that the site of the holy meal is determined by the Master's will (*the* for *theleis*), not human convenience. The repetition of *hetoimasomen* (prepare) in the text underscores their eagerness and the urgency of the task.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ ϊδου ειϲελθοντ ειϲελθοντ ϋμων ειϲ την πο ϲυναντηϲι ϋ ανθρωποϲ κεραμειον ϋδατοϲ βαϲτα ακολουθηϲα αυτω ειϲ την οικιαν ειϲ ην ειϲ

**English Translation**
And he said to them, "Behold, as you are entering into the city, a man will meet you carrying a jar of water; follow him into the house into which he enters."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine foreknowledge arranges the stage. The sign is specific: a man carrying water (*kerameion hydatos*), a task typically reserved for women, making him conspicuous to the watchful eye. They are to "follow" (*akolouthesa*) this humble water-bearer. It is a lesson in providence: God uses the mundane routines of unknown servants to guide His elect to the Upper Room. The path to the altar often begins with following a simple sign of service.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και ερει τω οικοδεϲπο τηϲ οικιαϲ λεγ λεγει ϲοι ο δι που εϲτ το καταλυμα μου οπου το παϲχα με των μαθητων μου φαγω

**English Translation**
And you shall say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, Where is my guest room where I may eat the passover with my disciples?'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Hear the authority of the Christ. He does not ask as a beggar but claims as a Lord: "Where is *my* guest room (*katalyma mou*)?" Even in a stranger's house, the space belongs to Him. He identifies Himself simply as *ho di* (*ho didaskalos*), "The Teacher." He gathers His own—"with my disciples"—into a private communion, separating the true flock from the world for this final, intimate revelation.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
κακει ϋμιν δειξει α μεγα εϲτρω κακει ετοι

**English Translation**
And he will show you a large upper room furnished; and there prepare.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The destination is revealed: an *anagaion* (*a*), an upper room. It is "large" (*mega*) to accommodate the expanding grace of the Kingdom, and "furnished" (*estromenon*), ready for the solemnity. We must ascend from the streets of the city to the upper room of the mind and spirit to celebrate the Pascha. "And there prepare" (*kakei hetoi*)—the physical preparation is done by the master of the house, but the spiritual preparation of the feast is the duty of the apostles.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
απελθον δε ευρον καθωϲ ειρηκει αυτοιϲ και ητοιμαϲαν το πα

**English Translation**
And having departed, they found just as he had said to them, and they prepared the Pa[ssover].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the obedience of the disciples. They depart upon the word of the Lord, and reality conforms strictly to His utterance ("just as he had said"). The text here is abrupt, ending the verse with the truncated "to pa" (the Pa[ssover]). It is as if the scribe, in his haste, acknowledges that the preparation is but a prelude to the great mystery; the word itself is cut short, for the shadow of the Old Law is about to be eclipsed by the Light of the New.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και οτε εγενε η ωρα ανεπεϲ ανεπεϲ και οι αποϲτολοι δωδεκα δωδεκα αποϲτολοι ϲυν αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And when the hour had [be]come, he reclined reclined, and the apostles twelve twelve apostles with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the manuscript bears witness to a profound trembling. Do you see how the scribe repeats "anepes anepes" (reclined reclined) and "dodeka dodeka" (twelve twelve)? While the critic sees an error of the hand, the eye of faith sees the weight of the moment. The Lord takes His place with such finality that the text stammers; the number of the election, the Twelve, is doubled in writing, emphasizing the fullness of the college gathered for this final, tragic meal.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν προϲ αυ επιθυμια επε τουτο το παϲχα φαγειν με υμων προ του με παθειν

**English Translation**
And he said to th[em]: With desire I de[sired] to eat this Passover wi[th] you before I suffer.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks of "epithymia" (desire). The Greek here is rugged—"pros au" for "to them" and "epe" for "desired"—yet the meaning pierces the soul. It is a desire not of hunger, but of love. He longs to share this meal "me' hymon" (with you), linking the communion of the table directly to the impending "pathein" (suffering). The feast and the passion are inextricably bound in His heart.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
λεγω γαρ οτι ου μη φαγω αυτο εωϲ οτου πληρω εν τη βαϲιλεια του

**English Translation**
For I say that I will by no means eat it until it be fulfill[ed] in the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A hard saying of negation. The "ou me" (by no means) establishes a fast that shall last until the Eschaton. The scribe abbreviates "plerothe" (fulfilled) to "plero" and "theou" (God) to a mere "tou". This shorthand reminds us that the fulfillment is a mystery not yet written in full. The Passover is not destroyed; it is suspended, waiting to be consumed anew in the Kingdom.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και δεξαμε ποτηριον ευ ειπεν λαβετε τουτο και διαμε αλληλοιϲ ειϲ εαυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And having receiv[ed] a cup, having given th[anks], he said: Take this and divi[de] it among yourselves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the abbreviation "eu" for "eucharistesas" (having given thanks). Even two letters suffice to denote the Great Thanksgiving. He commands them to "diame" (divide) it. This is the cup of the Old Covenant, shared and divided among the brethren, distinct from the cup of His Blood which follows. It is a communal act, "eis heautous" (among yourselves), creating the unity necessary to receive the greater mystery.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
λεγω γαρ ϋμιν ο ου μη πιω απο του νυν απο του γενηματοϲ τηϲ αμ εωϲ ου η βα του ελθη ˙

**English Translation**
For I say to you th[at] I will by no means drink from now on from the fruit of the vi[ne] until the ki[ngdom] of [God] comes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is heavily contracted here: "am" for *ampelou* (vine) and "ba" for *basileia* (kingdom). The Lord separates Himself from the fruit of the earth to prepare for the wine of heaven. He stands on the threshold between the "now" and the coming Kingdom. The scribe’s haste in writing "ba" (kingdom) reflects our own urgency; we await that Kingdom which is spoken of but not yet fully arrived.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και λαβων αρτον ευχαριϲτηϲαϲ ε και εδω αυτοιϲ λεγ τουτο εϲτιν το ϲω μου το ϋπερ υ διδομενον τουτο ποιειται ειϲ την εμην αναμνη ·

**English Translation**
And taking bread, having given thanks, he b[roke] and ga[ve] to them, say[ing]: This is my bo[dy] which is given for y[ou]; do this in my rememb[rance].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the center of our faith. The text reads "to so mou" (my bo[dy]). The breaking of the bread is mirrored in the breaking of the words—"e" for *eklasen* (broke), "edo" for *edoken* (gave). The body is given "hyper h[ymon]" (for you). The command "poieite" (do this) establishes the eternal liturgy. It is an "anamne[sin]"—not a mere memory, but a re-calling of the sacrifice into the present.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και το ποτηριον ωϲ μετα το δι λεγων ︴ του το ποτηριον η καινη διαθηκη εν τω αιματι μου το ϋπερ εκ

**English Translation**
And the cup like[wise] after the su[pper], saying: This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, which is po[ured out]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe inserts a mark (︴) as if pausing for breath before the "kaine diatheke" (New Covenant). The text ends abruptly with "hyper ek"—"for [you] po[ured out]." The verb for pouring out is cut off, just as His life was cut off for our sake. This cup is the seal of the new arrangement between God and man, ratified not in ink, but in the "haimati mou" (my blood).

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
πλην η χειρ του παραδιδοντοϲ με μετ εμου επι τηϲ τραπεζηϲ

**English Translation**
But behold, the hand of the one betraying me is with me on the table.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A chilling contrast. The hand that takes the consecrated bread is the hand of the traitor. "Met' emou" (with me)—the proximity of evil to the Holy One is the greatest scandal. The table, the place of fellowship, becomes the scene of the betrayal. Let us tremble, lest our hands also be found on the table while our hearts are far from Him.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
οτι ο μεν του ανθρωπου κατα το ωριϲμε πορευεται πλην ουαι τω αν εκεινω δι ου παραδιδοται

**English Translation**
Because the [Son] of Man indeed goes according to what has been deter[mined], but woe to that m[an] through whom he is betrayed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of divine will and human sin. The Son "poreuetai" (goes) according to the "horisme[non]" (determined plan). The Cross was not an accident. Yet, the necessity of the Passion does not absolve the agent of it. "Ouai" (Woe) is pronounced upon that man. God uses the malice of the wicked to achieve the salvation of the just, yet the wicked remain responsible for their malice.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοι ηρξαντο ϲυνζητειν προϲ εαυτουϲ το τιϲ αρα ειη εξ αυτων ειη ο τουτο μελλων πραϲϲειν

**English Translation**
And they began to discuss among themselves, the [question] who then it might be, might be, of them who was about to do this.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "eie" (might be) in the manuscript captures the stuttering confusion of the disciples. Self-examination turns into suspicion. In the presence of the Holy Sacrament, they are forced to look inward and ask if they are capable of such darkness. The unity of the table is fractured by the question of "tis ara" (who then?).

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε φιλονι ειϲ εαυτουϲ εν αυτοιϲ το τιϲ αυτων δο ειναι μιζων

**English Translation**
And there arose also a content[ion] among themselves, in them, the [question] who of them see[ms] to be greater.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
How quickly the human heart falls! From the "woe" of betrayal, they turn immediately to "philoni[kia]" (strife) about rank. The text is redundant—"eis heautous en autois" (among themselves in them)—emphasizing the internal rot of pride. While the Master prepares to be the least and to die, they argue over who is "mizon" (greater). This is the perpetual sickness of the church: seeking glory in the shadow of the Cross.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ οι βαϲιλειϲ των εθνων κυριευου αυτων και οι αρχοντεϲ των ε αυ και εξουϲιαζοντεϲ αυτων ευεργε καλουνται

**English Translation**
And he said to them: The kings of the nations lord it over them, and the rulers of the [e au] and those exercising authority over them are called benefac[tors].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the fragmentation of worldly power even in the ink of the scribe. Where the text reads `των ε αυ`, the genitive of the nations or perhaps 'of themselves' is collapsed, just as earthly dominions crumble before the Logos. The Lord notes that tyrants seek the title `ευεργε` (Benefactors), yet the word is abbreviated here, cut short. True beneficence belongs only to God; the rulers of this age claim the name but lack the substance, their titles withering on the parchment just as their authority withers before the coming Kingdom.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ϋ δε ουχ ουτωϲ αλλ ο μειζων εν υ γεινεϲθω ωϲ ο νεωτεροϲ και ο ηγουμενοϲ ωϲ ο διακονων

**English Translation**
But you [are] not thus; but the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and the leading one as the serving one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The order of the world is inverted. The text commands `γεινεϲθω` (let him become), implying a transformation of state. It is not enough to merely act the part; one must become `ωϲ ο νεωτεροϲ` (as the younger)—stripping away the pride of seniority and rank. The `ηγουμενοϲ` (leader) finds his true definition only in the `διακονων` (deacon/servant). In the Church, dignity is measured by the depth of one's servitude, a mystery the Gentiles cannot comprehend.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
τιϲ γαρ ο μειζων ο ανακειμενοϲ η ο διακονων ου ο ανακειμενοϲ εγω δε εν μεϲω ϋμων ειμι ωϲ ο διακονων

**English Translation**
For who [is] the greater? The one reclining or the one serving? [Is it] not the one reclining? But I am in the midst of you as the one serving.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Christological center. The Lord asks a rhetorical question based on human custom (`ου ο ανακειμενοϲ`—is it not the reclining one?), only to shatter it with His presence. He does not merely teach service; He embodies it (`ειμι`—I am). He stands `εν μεϲω` (in the midst), not above, though He is God. If the Master serves, how shall the servant demand to recline? The scribe preserves the stark contrast: the world's "greater" against the Lord's "serving."

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ δε εϲτε οι διαμε με εμου εν τοιϲ πι μου

**English Translation**
But you are those having remain- me with me in the tri[als] of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stumbles in awe, writing `διαμε με` (diame me), a stuttering attempt at *diamemenēkotes* (having remained/continued). This repetition of `με` (me) inadvertently emphasizes the proximity to Christ. You have remained *me*, with *me*. The trials are abbreviated as `πι` (for *peirasmois*), as if the sufferings are shortened for the elect's sake. To abide with Jesus is to abide in His trials; there is no other path to the Kingdom than remaining with Him in the crucible.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
κα διατιθεμαι υ̇μιν καθωϲ δι μοι ο πα μου βαϲιλει

**English Translation**
A[nd] I appoint to you, just as app[ointed] to me the Fa[ther] of me, a king[dom].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The covenant is absolute, though the words are heavily abbreviated (`κα`, `δι`, `πα`, `βαϲιλει`). The transmission of the Kingdom flows from the Father (`πα`) to the Son, and from the Son to the Apostles. The verb `διατιθεμαι` implies a testamentary disposition—a will. We inherit the Kingdom because He wills it to us, mirroring the eternal authority granted to Him by the Father. The text rushes, abbreviating the glory (`βαϲιλει`), hastening toward the eschatological banquet.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα εϲθιηται και πινηται επι τηϲ τραπεζηϲ μ(ου) εν τη βαϲιλεια μου και καθηϲεϲθε ε θρονων κριν ταϲ κριν ταϲ δωδεκα φυλαϲ του ι

**English Translation**
That you may eat and drink at the table of m(e) in the kingdom of me, and you will sit o[n] thrones judg[ing] the, judg[ing] the twelve tribes of I[srael].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the certainty of judgment! The scribe repeats `κριν ταϲ` (judging the) twice. Is this a mere error? Or does the Spirit testify through the pen that judgment is doubled, established, and inescapable? You shall sit `ε θρονων` (on thrones), judging the tribes of `του ι` (the Israel). The Eucharistic foreshadowing—eating and drinking at His table—is inextricably linked to the judicial authority of the Church. We feast now in mystery, that we may rule later in reality.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ο ϲι ϊδου ο ϲατα εξητηϲατο ϋμαϲ του ξινιαϲαι ϲινιαϲαι ϲινιαϲαι ωϲ τον ϲιτον

**English Translation**
And the Si[mon] said: Behold, the Sata[n] demanded you [plural] to sift, sift, sift as the wheat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying visual in the text! The adversary, `ο ϲατα` (Satan), demands the disciples. The scribe writes `ξινιαϲαι` (with a *xi*), then corrects it to `ϲινιαϲαι` (with a *sigma*), and repeats it yet again! Three times the word "sift" appears or is corrected. This agitation on the parchment mimics the violent shaking of the sieve. Satan does not merely wish to touch them; he wishes to shake them violently, repeatedly, just as the scribe's hand shook and stuttered over the word. The assault on the soul is relentless.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
εγω δε εδεηθην περι ϲου ϊνα μη εκλι η πιϲτιϲ ϲου και ϲυ ποτε επιϲτρε ϲτηριϲον τουϲ αδελφουϲ ϲου

**English Translation**
But I prayed concerning thee that the faith of thee might not fai[l]; and thou, when once turn[ed], strengthen the brothers of thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Against the violent sifting of Satan stands the singular prayer of Christ: `εγω δε` (But I). He prays specifically for Peter (`περι ϲου`—singular), that his faith might not `εκλι` (eclipse/fail utterly). The Lord foresees the fall—`και ϲυ ποτε επιϲτρε` (and you, when once turned/returned). Peter must fall to learn humility, but the return is promised before the sin is committed. His pastoral commission to "strengthen the brothers" is born out of his own restoration. One cannot strengthen others until one has wept over one's own weakness.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω μετα ϲου ετοι ειμι και ειϲ φυλακην και ειϲ θανατον πορευ

**English Translation**
But he said to him: With thee read[y] I am, both to prison and to death to g[o].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter speaks with the rashness of the flesh. `ετοι ειμι` (I am ready), he claims. He sees the destination—`φυλακην` (prison) and `θανατον` (death)—but he overestimates his own strength to `πορευ` (go/walk) there. The text truncates his "going" (`πορευ`), just as his actual journey will be cut short by fear. He claims readiness for the end, but he is not yet ready for the beginning of the Passion. He relies on his own will, not on the prayer of the Lord mentioned in the previous verse.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν λεγω ϲοι πετρε ου φωνη ϲημερον αλε εωϲ τρειϲ με απαρνηϲη ειδε

**English Translation**
But he said: I tell thee, Peter, [a] rooster will not crow today until three times me thou shalt deny to kno[w].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord uses Peter's name (`πετρε`), calling him back to his identity as the Rock, even as He predicts his crumbling. The `αλε` (rooster) becomes the herald of human frailty. The denial is specific: denying `ειδε` (to know) Him. To deny knowing the Life is to choose death. The Lord sets a limit on the darkness—"until three times"—signaling that the sin has a measure, but His mercy (implied in the earlier promise of return) has none.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ οτε απεϲτιλα ϋμαϲ ατερ βαλλαντιου και μηραϲ πηραϲ και μη τι τινοϲ ϋϲτερηϲαται οι δε ειπον ουδενοϲ

**English Translation**
And he said to them: When I sent you without purse and thi[ghs]—scrip, and not any of anything did you lack? And they said: Of nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A curious slip of the pen here: `μηραϲ` (thighs) corrected to `πηραϲ` (scrip/bag). The scribe errs, yet we see the truth: when Christ sent them, they needed neither strength of limb (thighs) nor provision of wealth (scrip). They lacked `ουδενοϲ` (of nothing). The past mission was one of supernatural provision, a time of peace where the laborer was worthy of his hire. But the Lord reminds them of this to contrast it with the coming hour of darkness.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ειπεν δε αυτοιϲ αλλα νυν ο εχ βαλλαντιον αρα ομοιωϲ και πη και ο μη εχ πωληϲατω το ϊ αυτου και αγοραϲατω μαχαι

**English Translation**
But he said, he said to them: But now, the one hav[ing] a purse, let him take [it], likewise also a sc[rip]; and the one not hav[ing], let him sell the g[arment] of him and buy a swor[d].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency is doubled: `ειπεν ειπεν` (He said, He said). The era has shifted. `αλλα νυν` (But now). The protection of peace is withdrawn; the Shepherd is to be struck. He commands the exchange of the `το ϊ` (the garment—protection from elements) for a `μαχαι` (sword—protection from violence). This is not a call to banditry, but a solemn declaration that they will now be numbered among transgressors. They must be prepared for a world that is no longer hospitable. The nakedness of the cross approaches; one sells the outer garment to face the sharp edge of persecution.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
λεγω γαρ ϋμιν οτι τουτο το γεγραμμε δει τελεϲθη εν εμοι το και μετα ανομων ε και γαρ το περι εμου τελοϲ εχει

**English Translation**
For I say to you that this which is written must be accomplished in me: 'And with lawless ones [he was reckoned]'; for indeed that concerning me has an end.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine necessity (*dei*) placed upon the Lord. He does not stumble into death but marches toward the fulfillment of Scripture. The abbreviation *ε* stands for *elogisthe* (was reckoned), marking the great exchange where the Holy One is counted among the *anomon* (lawless), that the lawless might be counted among the saints. The *telos* (end/goal) is not merely a cessation of life, but the completion of the prophetic architecture.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπαν ϊδου μαχαιρε μαχαιραι ωδε δυο ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ ϊκανον εϲτιν

**English Translation**
And they said, "Look, swords—here are two." And he said to them, "It is enough."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples, still thinking in terms of earthly kingdoms, produce physical weapons (*machairai*). The scribe here corrects the spelling, yet the error of the disciples remains uncorrected in their hearts. When the Lord says "It is enough," he does not validate the sufficiency of two blades against a legion, but rather dismisses their carnal misunderstanding. He speaks of the end of conversation, not the adequacy of their armory.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και εξελθων επο κατα το εθοϲ ειϲ το οροϲ των ε ηκολου δε αυτω και οι μαθηται

**English Translation**
And coming out, he went according to custom to the Mount of [Olives]; and the disciples also followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates the journey (*epo* for *eporeuthe*) and the destination (*e* for *elaion*), yet the path is clear. He moves according to *ethos* (custom/habit). Even in the face of betrayal, the Lord maintains his discipline of prayer. The disciples follow, physically present but spiritually lagging, drawn by the gravity of his person even as they fail to grasp the gravity of the hour.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
γενομενοϲ δε επι του τοπου ειπεν αυ προϲευχεϲθαι μη ειϲελθειν ειϲ πιραϲμον

**English Translation**
And being at the place, he said to [them], "Pray not to enter into trial."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Upon reaching the *topou* (place)—a specific arena of spiritual combat—the command is given. The scribe’s spelling *pirasmon* (for *peirasmon*) reflects the sound of the age. The danger is not merely facing the trial, but *eiselthein* (entering into) it, being swallowed by the temptation to abandon the will of God when the flesh is weak.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ απεϲπα απεϲπαϲθη απ αυτων ωϲει λιθου βολην και θειϲ τα γονατα προϲ

**English Translation**
And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and placing his knees, [he prayed],

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reveals a stutter in the writing (*apespa* corrected to *apespasthe*), mirroring the violence of the separation. He was "torn away" from them. The distance of a "stone's throw" signifies that he is within sight but beyond reach. By bending the knees (*theis ta gonata*), the Creator assumes the posture of the creature, demonstrating that true power is found in submission to the Father.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
λεγων πατερ ει βουλι παρε τουτο το ποτηριον τουτο απ εμου πλην μη το θελημα μου αλ το ϲον γεινεϲθω

**English Translation**
Saying, "Father, if you wish, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not my will but yours be done."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the crux of our salvation. The human will of Christ naturally shrinks from death (*pare* for *parenegke*—remove), proving he is truly man; yet his divine hypostasis ensures the human will submits perfectly to the Father. The *plen* (nevertheless) is the bridge over which the redeemed pass from death to life. He drinks the cup of wrath so we might drink the cup of blessing.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
ωφθη δε αυτω αγ απ ουρανου ενιϲχυων αυτον ωφθη δε αυτω αγγελοϲ απ ουρανου ενιϲχυων αυτον

**English Translation**
And there appeared to him an angel from heaven strengthening him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes, then rewrites, as if trembling at the mystery. An angel strengthens the Lord of Angels. This *enischuon* (strengthening) testifies to the reality of his exhaustion. He did not act out a play of suffering; he emptied himself so profoundly that he accepted the ministry of his own servants to endure the night.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
και γεναμενοϲ ε αγωνια εκτενε προϲηυ και εγενετο ϊδρωϲ αυτου ωϲι θρομβοι αιματοϲ καταβαινοντοϲ ε την γην και γεναμενοϲ εν αγωνια εκτενεϲτερον προϲηυχετο και εγενετο ϊδρωϲ αυτου ωϲι θρομβοι αιματοϲ καταβαινοντοϲ επι την γην

**English Translation**
And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like clots of blood falling down upon the earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is doubled here, a scribal repetition emphasizing the intensity. The *agonia* is the contest of the athlete. The *idros* (sweat) becoming like *thromboi* (clots/drops) of blood indicates the extreme pressure of the soul crushing the body. This blood falling *epi ten gen* (upon the earth) is the first act of atonement, sanctifying the very dust from which Adam was made.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
και αναϲταϲ απο τηϲ προϲευχηϲ ελθων προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ ευρεν κοιμωμενουϲ αυτουϲ απο τηϲ λυ

**English Translation**
And rising from the prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from [grief].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He rises (*anastas*) victorious from the prayer, but finds his church in slumber. The text notes they sleep *apo tes lu* (from the grief/sorrow). It is a heavy, oppressive sorrow that dulls the senses. While the Master sweats blood in the battle, the servants are overcome by the weight of the air, unable to watch even one hour.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυ τι καθευδετε αναϲταντεϲ προϲ ϊνα μη ειϲελθηται ειϲ πι

**English Translation**
And he said to [them], "Why do you sleep? Rising, [pray] that you may not enter into [temptation]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rebuke is gentle but urgent. *Ti katheudete* (Why do you sleep?). The remedy for spiritual lethargy is action: *anastantes* (rising). The abbreviated *pros* calls them to prayer, and *pi* warns again of the *pirasmon* (temptation). The trial is no longer approaching; it has arrived.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ετι αυτου λαλουν ϊδου οχλοϲ κ(αι) ο λεγομενοϲ ϊου ειϲ των δωδε προηρχετο αυ και ηγγιϲεν τω φιληϲαι αυτον

**English Translation**
While he was still speaking, look, a crowd, and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading [them], and he drew near to kiss him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The narrative moves with terrible speed. *Eti autou laloun* (While he was still speaking), the betrayal begins. The text highlights the tragedy: *Iou* (Judas), explicitly marked as *heis ton dodeka* (one of the twelve). He leads the hostile *ochlos* (crowd). The act of intimacy, the kiss, is perverted into the signal of death.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
δε ειπεν αυτω ϊουδα φιληματι τον του ανθρωπου πα

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] said to him, "Judas, with a kiss do you [betray] the [Son] of Man?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord names the betrayer and the act. The sentence is clipped in the manuscript (*pa* for *paradidous*—betray/hand over), sharp as the accusation itself. To use the *philemati* (kiss), the sign of peace and brotherhood, to hand over the *Son of Man* is the ultimate inversion of order. Even in this moment, the Lord's question offers a final mirror to the conscience of the traitor.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
ειδοντεϲ δε οι πε αυτον το εϲομε ειπαν ει παταξομεν εν μαχαιρη

**English Translation**
But those around him, seeing what was to be, said, "If we shall strike with a sword?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the confusion of the disciples; they perceive the future event (*to esomenon*), the inevitability of the arrest, yet they resort to the weapons of the world. They ask "if" (*ei*) they should strike, yet the very presence of the sword (*machaira*) in the hand of a follower of the Prince of Peace betrays a lack of understanding. They seek to battle spiritual darkness with iron blades.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
και επα ειϲ τιϲ εξ αυ του αρχϊερε τον δουλον και αφιλεν το ουϲ αυτου το δεξιον

**English Translation**
And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and took off his right ear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The impulse of the flesh acts before the command is given. The text notes the specific injury—the "right ear" (*ous to dexion*)—perhaps signifying an attempt to silence the hearing of the law, or a clumsy blow meant for the head. The anonymity of the striker ("a certain one") in this Codex casts the shame of violence upon the collective body of the disciples, rather than naming Peter alone.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ειπεν εατε εωϲ τουτου και αψαμενοϲ του ωτιου αυ

**English Translation**
But answering, he said, "Permit as far as this." And touching his ear...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord sets a limit to the violence of his defenders: "Permit as far as this." He halts the defense of the flesh to embrace the cup of the Spirit. The text here portrays the divine compassion; even in the moment of seizure, he extends his hand not to strike, but to touch (*hapsamenos*) the wounded enemy. The manuscript abruptly ends the phrase at "his" (*au*), leaving the healing act implied by the divine touch.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ τουϲ παραγενο προϲ επ αυ αρχϊερειϲ και ϲτρατηγουϲ του ϊε και πρεϲβυτε ωϲ επι ληϲτ ληϲτ εξηλθαται μετα μα και ξυλ

**English Translation**
And he said to the high priests and captains of the temple and elders having arrived against him, "As against a robber did you come out with swords and clubs?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord rebukes the dignity of the office holders. High priests (*archiereis*), captains, and elders have mobilized a military force against a single man of peace. He questions their perception: do they see him as a *lesten* (robber/bandit)? By treating the Word of God as a criminal, they reveal their own alignment with the violence of the world, wielding "swords and clubs" against the Truth.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
καθ ημεραν ον μου μεθ υμ υμ εν τω ϊερω ουκ ε ταϲ χει επ εμε αλλ αυ εϲτιν υμων η ωρα κ(αι) η εξουϲια του ϲκο

**English Translation**
Daily while I was with you in the temple you did not [stretch out] the hands against me; but this is your hour and the authority of darkness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound theological distinction is made. In the light of day and the sanctity of the Temple, their hands were restrained by God. Now, the restraint is lifted. He calls it "your hour" (*hymon he hora*), yet immediately qualifies it as the "authority of darkness" (*exousia tou skotous*). This confirms that their temporary victory is not of God, but of the dark powers permitted to act for the mystery of the Passion.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
ϲυλλαβοντεϲ δε αυ ηγαγον και ει ειϲ την οικιαν του αρχϊε ὁ δε πετροϲ ηκολου μακροθεν

**English Translation**
And having seized him, they led and [led him in] into the house of the high priest; but Peter was following from afar.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The physical seizure of the Lord contrasts with the spiritual distancing of the disciple. While Christ is led into the heart of the trial, Peter follows, but the text emphasizes the distance: *makrothen* (from afar). This physical distance mirrors the growing gap in Peter's heart, moving from the boast of dying with Him to the safety of the shadows.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
πε δε πυρʼ εν μεϲω τηϲ αυληϲ και ϲυνκα εκα ο πετροϲ μεϲω αυτων

**English Translation**
But [they] having kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sitting together, Peter sat in the midst of them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Notice the positioning: the fire is "in the midst" (*meso*) of the courtyard, and Peter sits "in the midst" (*meso*) of the godless. He seeks the warmth of the world's fire rather than the fire of the Spirit. By sitting with the persecutors, he physically aligns himself with them, preparing the way for his verbal alignment with their denial.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
ϊ δε αυτον παιδιϲκη τιϲ κα προϲ το φωϲ και ατενι αυτω ειπεν και ουτοϲ ϲυν αυ ην

**English Translation**
And a certain servant-girl, seeing him sitting toward the light and staring at him, said, "And this one was with him."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The light (*phos*) of the fire betrays him. It is a servant-girl (*paidiske*), the lowliest in the courtyard, who serves as the instrument of testing. She stares intently (*atenisasa*); the world often scrutinizes the believer more closely than we suspect. Her accusation is simple association: "He was with him."

**Verse 57**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ηρνη λεγων ουκ οι αυτον γυναι ·

**English Translation**
But he denied, saying, "I do not know him, Woman."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The collapse of the Rock. He denies (*ernesato*) not just the association, but the very knowledge of the Lord (*ouk oida*). He addresses her as "Woman" (*gynai*), a deflection to distance himself from her scrutiny. To save his life, he severs the bond of recognition with the Source of Life.

**Verse 58**

**Greek Text**
και μετα βραχυ παλιν ε ϊδων αυτ εφη και ϲυ εξ αυ ει ο δε πετροϲ εφη ανθρωπε ου ειμι

**English Translation**
And after a little, another seeing him said, "And you are of them." But Peter said, "Man, I am not."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The second test comes quickly. The accusation shifts from being "with him" to being "of them" (*ex auton*)—identifying him as part of the group, the church. Peter responds with "Man" (*anthrope*), paralleling his previous "Woman." His denial is existential: *ou eimi* (I am not). He negates his identity as a disciple.

**Verse 59**

**Greek Text**
και διαϲτα ωϲει ωραϲ μι αλλοϲ τιϲ διϊϲχυ λεγων επ α και ουτοϲ μετ αυτου ην και γαρ γαλιλαιοϲ εϲτιν

**English Translation**
And about one hour having passed, a certain other insisted saying, "In truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
An hour of grace passes, yet Peter remains in the seat of mockers. The third accuser insists "in truth" (*ep aletheias*). The world recognizes the believer by his nature—here, his Galilean accent or manner. One cannot hide one's origin; the follower of Christ carries the mark of his calling even when he tries to suppress it.

**Verse 60**

**Greek Text**
ει δε ὁ πετροϲ ανθρωπε ουκ οι τι λεγειϲ και πα ετι αυτου λαλο αυτου εφωνη αλεκτωρ

**English Translation**
But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you say." And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final denial feigns total ignorance: "I do not know what you say." He pretends not to understand the language of the Kingdom. And *parachrema* (immediately), the natural world convicts the spiritual failure. The rooster's cry (*alektor*) breaks the illusion of safety. While the word of denial is still on his lips (*lalountos*), the prophetic word of Christ is fulfilled.

**Verse 61**
**Greek Text**
και ϲτραφειϲ ο ενε τω πετρω και ϋπεμνηϲθη ο πετροϲ του ρημα του ωϲ ειπ ειπ αυτω οτι πριν αλε φωνηϲε ϲη απαρνηϲη με τριϲ

**English Translation**
And turning, the [Lord looked] at Peter, and Peter was reminded of the word of the [Lord], how he said, said to him that: Before [the] cock crows [today], you will deny me thrice.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the sovereign gaze of the Word. The text reads *strapheis* (turning), implying that amidst the chaos of the arrest, the Lord’s attention remains fixed on the restoration of a single soul. The manuscript here abbreviates the divine title and action (`ο ενε`), yet the faithful eye sees *Kyrios eneblepsen*—the Lord looked into him. This looking is not merely optical but ontological; it pierces the conscience. Note the repetition in the scribe's hand, *eip eip* ("said, said"); this is no error, but a pneumatic emphasis on the immutability of Christ's prophecy. The word once spoken stands firm. Peter remembers not just the prediction, but the authority of the Speaker. The cock's crow is the herald of morning, but for Peter, it signals the dark night of the soul necessary for true repentance.

**Verse 62**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθ εξελθ εξω εκλαυϲεν πι

**English Translation**
And going out, going out outside, he wept [bitterly].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers with the urgency of Peter's flight: *exelth exelth* ("going out, going out"). One departure is not enough; he must flee the occasion of sin entirely. He goes *exo* (outside)—outside the high priest’s courtyard, which has become a den of betrayal, and outside the circle of his own pride. The final syllable *pi* stands as a fragment of *pikros* (bitterly). The bitterness of the tears corresponds to the sweetness of the grace he has forfeited. Yet, in these tears, the baptism of repentance begins. He who was called the Rock is dissolved into water, that he may be hardened again not by fleshly resolve, but by the fire of the Spirit.

**Verse 63**
**Greek Text**
και οι ανδρεϲ οι ϲυ ϲ αυτον ενεπεζαν ενεπεζον αυτω δεροντεϲ

**English Translation**
And the men, the ones [holding] him, mocked, were mocking him, beating [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we see the mystery of the Bound God. The phrase *oi sy s* suggests *oi synechontes*, those holding or constraining Him who holds the universe in His palm. The text fluctuates between aorist and imperfect tenses (*enepezan enepezon*), revealing that this mockery was both a singular historic crime and a continuous, unfolding act of malice. They beat Him (*derontes*), striking the very flesh that was assumed for their salvation. The Creator submits to the violence of the creature, demonstrating that true power is found in the capacity to endure suffering, not to inflict it.

**Verse 64**
**Greek Text**
και πε ε αυτ αυτ λεγοντεϲ προφη τιϲ εϲτιν ο παιϲαϲ ϲε

**English Translation**
And [blindfolding] him, him, [they asked] saying: Prophesy, who is the one who struck you?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double accusative *aut aut* ("him, him") emphasizes the intensity of their assault on His person. They blindfold the Light of the World, thinking to hide their deeds from His sight. Foolish men! They ask, "Who is it that struck you?" as if He who searches the hearts and reins needs physical eyes to identify a sinner. Every blow they strike is known to Him before the foundation of the world. They mock His prophetic office exactly when He is fulfilling the greatest prophecy of the Suffering Servant. They cover His face, yet it is their own eyes that are veiled by the god of this world.

**Verse 65**
**Greek Text**
και ε πολλα βλαϲφη ελεγον ειϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
And [many other things] blaspheming they said against him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates *etera* (other things) to a simple *e*, as if to hasten past the catalogue of horrors. "Many other things" they spoke, blaspheming. The Evangelist exercises a holy reticence, shielding the ears of the faithful from the full torrent of abuse hurled at the Savior. It suffices to know that the human tongue, created to praise God, here reaches the nadir of its corruption. They speak *eis auton* (into/against Him), directing their venom at the only Vessel capable of absorbing it and transmuting it into forgiveness.

**Verse 66**
**Greek Text**
και ωϲ ημερα εγενε ϲυνηχθη το πρεϲβυτεριον του λαου αρχϊερειϲ τε και γραμματιϲ και απηγαγον αυτον ειϲ το ϲυνεδριον αυτων

**English Translation**
And as day came, the presbytery of the people was gathered, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Night passes, but the darkness of their hearts remains. As *hemera* (day) happens, the *presbyterion* (elders) gather. These are the supposed guardians of the Law, the *archiereis* (chief priests) and *grammateis* (scribes), yet they assemble not to worship the Lord of the Temple, but to condemn Him. They lead Him into their *synedrion* (council/Sanhedrin). Observe the spatial movement: they drag the Infinite Limitless One into the narrow confines of their human court. They seek to judge the Judge, unaware that by their proceedings, they are sealing their own judgment before the court of Heaven.

**Verse 67**
**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ ει ϲυ ει ο ειπον ημιν · ειπεν δε αυτοιϲ ε υμιν ειπω ου μη πιϲτευ

**English Translation**
Saying: If you are the [Christ], tell us. But he said to them: If I tell you, you will not believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation begins with a conditional: "If you are..." The title *Christos* is elided (*o*), for they cannot bear to speak the Name in truth. The Lord’s response cuts to the root of their unbelief. He does not lack the identity, but they lack the faculty of faith. "If I tell you, you will not believe." Faith does not arise from evidence presented to a hostile will; it arises from a heart prepared to receive the Truth. He refuses to cast the pearl of His Messianic dignity before those who have already decided to trample it. His silence is judgment; His speech is condemnation of their hardness.

**Verse 68**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε ερω ου μη απο

**English Translation**
And if I ask, you will not [answer].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is truncated—*ou me apo* (you will not [answer])—reflecting the abruptness of the Lord's dismissal of their charade. If He were to question them according to the Scriptures, as He did in the Temple regarding the son of David, they would remain silent. Their dialogue is a pretense. They seek a pretext, not a teacher. The Lord exposes the futility of engaging with malice. He who is the Word withdraws from the conversation, for there is no communion between light and darkness.

**Verse 69**
**Greek Text**
απο του νυν δε ε ο του ανθρω καθημενοϲ εκ δεξιων τηϲ δυ του

**English Translation**
But from now on the [Son] of Man will be sitting at the right hand of the [Power] of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the thunderclap of revelation. *Apo tou nyn*—"from now on." The humiliation is the path to exaltation. The scribe uses nomina sacra and abbreviations (*o του ανθρω* for Son of Man, *δυ του* for Power of God) to encase these holy mysteries. Christ claims the prophecy of Daniel and the Psalm: He is the Son of Man ascending to the Ancient of Days. He sits at the *dexion* (right hand) of the *dynameos* (Power). While they stand to judge Him on earth, He is seated to judge them from Heaven. The cross is the throne from which He begins His reign.

**Verse 70**
**Greek Text**
ειπαν δε παντεϲ ϲυ ουν ει ο του θ θ ο δε προϲ αυτουϲ ε ϋμειϲ λεγετε οτι εγω ειμι

**English Translation**
And they all said: Are you therefore the [Son] of [God]? And he [said] to them: You say that I am.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The collective gasp of the council: *sy oun ei* ("Are you therefore..."). They grasp the implication of His words. The text abbreviates the highest title: *o tou th th* (the Son of God). This is the crux of the ages. His answer is supreme majesty: *hymeis legete* ("You say..."). It is an affirmation that throws the burden of the confession back upon them. They have spoken the truth in their attempt to accuse Him. "I am"—the Divine Name echoes in the chamber. He defines Himself not by their laws, but by His eternal generation from the Father.

**Verse 71**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπαν τι ετι χριαν εχομεν μαρ αυτοι γαρ η απο του ϲτοματοϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
And they said: What further need do we have of [witness]? For we ourselves [heard] from his mouth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The trial collapses into a verdict of self-condemnation. They ask, "What need do we have of *mar* (witness)?" They dispense with the Law's requirement for witnesses because they believe the Truth itself is a crime. "We ourselves heard (*e* / *ekousamen*) from his mouth." Indeed, they heard the Gospel of His Sonship, and they called it blasphemy. The very words that should have brought them to their knees in worship are used to sentence Him to death. Thus, the Scripture is fulfilled: the Stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner, and it is marvelous—and terrible—in our eyes.
