**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε αυ εγγιζοντεϲ παντεϲ οι τελω και οι αμαρτω ακουειν αυτου

**English Translation**
Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were drawing near to him to hear him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the magnetic pull of the Word. The text says *pantes* (all)—a totality of the outcast class. They do not merely stand at a distance but are *engizontes* (drawing near), a continuous action of approach. The clean withdraw, but the unclean press forward, for the physician attracts the wounded. They come not to see a spectacle, but *akouein* (to hear), indicating a hunger of the soul that the Law alone could not satisfy.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και διεγογγυζον οι τε φαριϲαιοι κ(αι) οι γραμματειϲ λε οτι αμαρ προϲδεχε ˙ και ϲυνεϲθιει αυτοιϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And both the Pharisees and the scribes were murmuring thoroughly, saying that 'He receives sinners and eats with them.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prefix *dia-* in *diegoggyzon* implies a murmuring that is pervasive and thorough, vibrating through the crowd of the self-righteous. Their accusation is twofold and intended as an insult, yet it proclaims the Gospel truth: He *prosdechetai* (receives/accepts) them to Himself, and worse, He enters into communion with them by eating (*synesthiei*). To the legalist, this is contamination; to us, it is the sacrament of mercy.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ‾̷‾ προϲ αυτουϲ την παραβολην ταυτ ταυτ λεγων ·

**English Translation**
But Jesus spoke toward them this this parable, saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *taut* (this), perhaps a slip of the pen, yet spiritually it emphasizes the singularity of what follows. The Lord addresses "them"—the murmurers. He does not speak to the sinners directly here, but defends the sinners to the righteous. The Nomina Sacra for Jesus stands as the subject, the divine authority countering the murmuring of men.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
τιϲ ανθρω εξ υμων εχ εχ εκατον προβατα και απολεϲαϲ εξ αυ εν ου καταλι τα ενενηκον εννεα εν τη ερη και πορευεται επι το απολωλοϲ εωϲ ου ευρη αυτο

**English Translation**
What man of you, having having a hundred sheep and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the lost one until he finds it?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters *ech ech* (having having), emphasizing possession. The logic of God is revealed: He leaves the majority *en te eremo* (in the desert). We often think of the fold as a fortress, but here the ninety-nine are left in the wild, for safety is defined only by where the Shepherd *is*, and He is with the lost. The search is indefinite in duration—*heos ou* (until)—implying He will never cease until recovery is made.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και ευρων επιτι επι τουϲ ω αυτου χαιρ

**English Translation**
And having found [it], he lays [it] upon his shoulders rejoicing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He does not drive the sheep back with a rod, nor does He complain of the weight. He places the burden *epi tous omous* (upon the shoulders). This is the Incarnation: the Word taking upon Himself the heavy nature of flesh. The text notes he does this *chairon* (rejoicing); the weight of our salvation is His joy, not His drudgery.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και ελθων ειϲ τον οικον ϲυνκαλει τουϲ φιλουϲ και τουϲ γειτοναϲ λε αυτοιϲ ϲυν μοι οτι ευ το προβατον μου το απολωλοϲ

**English Translation**
And coming into the house he calls together the friends and the neighbors, saying to them: '[Rejoice] with me, for I found my sheep, the lost one.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Salvation is not a private matter; it requires a synod of joy. He returns to *ton oikon* (the house), a figure of the Church or Heaven. He reasserts ownership: *to probaton mou* (my sheep). It was lost, but it never ceased to be His. The invitation is to share in the finder's joy, contrasting with the Pharisees who refused to share in the eating.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
λεγω οτι ουτωϲ χαρα εν τω ουρανω εϲτε επι ενι αμαρ μετανοουν η επι ενενηκ ενενηκ ενενηκοντα εννεα δικαι οιτινεϲ ου χρι χρι εχουϲι μετανοιαϲ

**English Translation**
I say that thus joy in heaven will be over one sinner repenting than over ninety-ninety-ninety-nine righteous ones who have no need-need of repentance.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript bears witness to a profound agitation here: *enenek enenek enenekonta* (ninety ninety ninety). The vast number of the self-righteous is stuttered, emphasizing their multitude, yet they are outweighed by the *eni* (one). The repetition of *chri chri* (need need) mocks the arrogance of those who believe they have no lack. Heaven rejoices not in the static perfection of the proud, but in the dynamic return of the humble.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
η τιϲ γυνη δραχμαϲ εχουϲα δεκα εαν απολεϲη δραχμ δραχμ μιαν ουχι απτι λυ και ϲαροι τ τ οικιαν και ζητι ε εωϲ ου ευρη

**English Translation**
Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma-drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the the house and seek [diligently] until she finds [it]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The woman represents the Wisdom of God or the Church. The coin bears the Image of the King, buried in the dust of the world. She lights the *lychnon* (lamp)—the illumination of the Holy Spirit. The text shows a frantic energy with the repetition of *drachm* and the article *t t*. She sweeps the house; the disturbance of the dust is necessary to recover the image.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
και ευρουϲα ϲυνκαλει ταϲ φι και γειτοναϲ λε ϲυνχαρητε μοι οτι ευρον την δρα ην απωλεϲα ·

**English Translation**
And having found [it] she calls together the [female] friends and neighbors, saying: 'Rejoice with me, for I found the drachma which I lost.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the gender precision in the Greek: *tas philas* (the female friends). The community of joy matches the seeker. She confesses *en apolesa* (which I lost)—acknowledging that the coin was lost within her own house. Yet the recovery obliterates the shame of the loss, replaced entirely by the imperative to *syncharete* (rejoice together).

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ λεγω γεινεται χαρα ενω των αγγελ του επι ενι αμαρ μετανοουν ˙

**English Translation**
Thus, I say, joy arises before the angels of [God] over one sinner repenting.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The joy *geinetai* (arises/happens) in the presence of the angels. It does not say the angels rejoice, but that there is joy *before* them—implying the joy belongs to God Himself, and the angels are the witnesses to this divine delight. The singular repentance of a sinner is a spectacle for the celestial hosts.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ανθρωποϲ τιϲ ειχεν δυο ϋϊουϲ

**English Translation**
And He said: 'A certain man had two sons.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We move from the animal (sheep) and the mineral (coin) to the rational (sons). The diaeresis on *ϋϊουϲ* marks the separation clearly. The "two" signifies the division within humanity—Jew and Gentile, or the righteous and the sinner. Both are sons of the same Father; their relation is by nature, not merely by purchase or minting.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ο νεω αυτων τω πα δοϲ μοι το επι μεροϲ τηϲ ουϲιαϲ · και ο δε διειλεν αυτοιϲ τον βιον

**English Translation**
And the younger of them said to the father: 'Give me the portion of the substance falling [to me].' And he divided to them the living.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The younger son's request is a demand for the Father's death, for inheritance is the fruit of the grave. He asks for *ousias* (substance/being), but the Father divides *ton bion* (the life/livelihood). The Father grants the request, submitting to the terrifying freedom of the human will. He divides the life *autois* (to them [both])—the separation affects both the leaver and the stayer.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) μετ ου πολλαϲ ημε ϲυναγαγων α ο νεωτεροϲ ϋϊοϲ απεδημηϲεν ειϲ χωραν μακραν και εκει διεϲκορπι την ουϲιαν εαυ ειϲ χωραν μα ζων αϲωτωϲ ζων αϲωτωϲ

**English Translation**
And after not many days, gathering [all], the younger son went abroad into a far country, and there scattered his substance [into a far country], living profligately, living profligately.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the haste of sin in the phrase "not many days"; the will, once turned from the Father, rushes toward ruin. The scribe here stumbles, repeating "into a far country" and "living profligately" (*ζων αϲωτωϲ*), yet this error serves a homiletic truth: the life of the sinner is a repetitive cycle of waste. He scatters his "substance" (*ουϲιαν*)—not merely gold, but the very essence of his being given by the Father—into the void of the foreign land.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
δαπανηϲαν δε αυτου παντα εγενετο λειμοϲ ϊ κατα την χω εκεινην και αυτοϲ ηρξατο ϋϲτε

**English Translation**
But having spent all of his, there arose a [mighty] famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The famine (*λειμοϲ*) does not strike until the soul has emptied itself (*δαπανηϲαν*). The world, represented by "that country," possesses no inherent nourishment; it only appears abundant while one has resources to squander. When the grace is spent, the inherent barrenness of the material world is revealed, and the soul enters a state of lack (*ϋϲτε*).

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και πορευθιϲ εκολληθη ενι τ πολειτων τηϲ χω εκεινηϲ και επεμ αυτον ειϲ τουϲ αγρουϲ αυτου βο χοιρουϲ

**English Translation**
And having gone, he was joined to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the degradation: a son of the Covenant becomes a servant of swine. The verb *εκολληθη* (was glued/joined) implies a desperate, sticky attachment to the world. He seeks refuge in a citizen of the far country—a demon or a prince of this world—who offers him no dignity, only the care of unclean beasts. He who refused to serve a loving Father now slaves for a heartless stranger.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και επεθυμει χορτα εκ των κερατιων ων ηϲ οι χοιροι και ουδειϲ εδιδου αυ

**English Translation**
And he desired to be filled from the carob pods which the swine were eating, and no one gave to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads *χορτα* (truncated for *χορτασθηναι*), expressing the raw, unfinished pang of hunger. He envies the swine their husks (*κερατιων*), for the animals are satisfied with their nature, but the human soul cannot be filled with the food of beasts. "No one gave to him" because the world takes but never gives; charity is found only in the house he left behind.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ειϲ εαυτον δε ελθων εφη ποϲοι μιϲθιοι του πατροϲ μου περιϲϲευουϲ αρτων εγω δε λει ωδε απολλυ

**English Translation**
But coming to himself he said, 'How many hired servants of my father abound in loaves, but I here perish with hunger.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"Coming to himself" marks the return of reason, which sin had scattered. Repentance begins with memory—remembering the abundance of the Father's house. Even the *μιϲθιοι* (hirelings), the lowest rank in the Kingdom, possess a superabundance (*περιϲϲευουϲ*) of bread, while the son, holding to his prideful autonomy, faces death (*απολλυ*).

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
αναϲταϲ δε πορευ προϲ τον πα μου και ερω αυτω πατερ ημαρ ειϲ τον ουραν και ενωπιον ϲου

**English Translation**
'Rising up I will go to my father and will say to him, "Father, I sinned against heaven and before you."'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The resurrection of the will (*αναϲταϲ*) precedes the movement of the feet. His confession is theological: he recognizes that his sin is primarily against "heaven" (the divine order) and secondarily "before you" (the paternal relationship). He prepares to address him as *πατερ*, retaining the relational claim despite his unworthiness.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ουκετι ειμι αξιοϲ κληθηναι υϊοϲ ϲου ποιηϲον με ωϲ ε των μιϲθιων ϲου

**English Translation**
'I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He judges himself correctly: by the law of justice, he has forfeited his sonship. He seeks a transaction—labor for bread ("make me as one of your hirelings"). He underestimates the nature of the Father, thinking he must earn his place back through servitude, unaware that grace operates outside the economy of wages.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και αναϲταϲ ηλθεν προϲ τον πατερα αυτου ετι δε αυτου μακραν απεχοντοϲ ειδεν αυτον ο πατηρ αυτου και εϲπλαγχνιϲθη και δραμων επεπε επι τον τραχη αυτου και κα αυτον

**English Translation**
And rising up he came to his father. But while he was still far off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and running fell upon his neck and kissed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Father's vision is sharper than the son's; he sees him "far off." The text uses *δραμων* (running)—an act undignified for an elder in the East, showing that divine love casts aside dignity to rescue the lost. The kiss (*κα*) is given before the son utters a single word of his prepared confession; forgiveness precedes the plea.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτω ο πατερ ημαρτον ειϲ τον ουρανον και ενωπιον ϲου ουκετι ειμι αξιοϲ κληθηναι ϲου ποιηϲον με ωϲ ε των μιϲθιων ϲου ·

**English Translation**
And the [son] said to him, 'Father, I sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called [yours]; make me as one of your hired servants.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In this Codex, the son completes his prepared speech, including the request to be made a hireling (*ποιηϲον με ωϲ ε των μιϲθιων ϲου*), which other traditions omit. He persists in his legalistic mindset even while in the Father's embrace. Note the scribal omission of *υϊοϲ* (son) after *κληθηναι* (to be called), perhaps reflecting the son's feeling that the very word is too high for him now.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ο πατηρ προϲ τουϲ δουλουϲ εαυτου ταχυ εξενεγ ϲτολην την πρωτην και ενδυ αυτον και δοτε δακτυλιον ειϲ τ χειρα αυτου και ϋ ειϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ

**English Translation**
But the father said to his servants, 'Quickly bring out the first robe and clothe him, and give a ring for his hand and sandals for the feet.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Father ignores the request to be a servant and commands the restoration of sonship. The "first robe" (*ϲτολην την πρωτην*) signifies the restoration of the primal innocence lost in Adam. The ring is the seal of the Spirit and authority; the sandals (*ϋ* for *υποδηματα*) distinguish the free son from the barefoot slave.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και φερετε τον μοϲχον τον ϲιτευτον θυϲατε και φαγοντεϲ ευ

**English Translation**
'And bring the fatted calf, sacrifice it, and eating let us be merry.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "fatted calf" implies preparation; God has been ready for the sinner's return from eternity. The command *θυϲατε* (sacrifice) elevates the meal to a holy oblation. The abbreviation *ευ* stands for *ευφρανθωμεν* (let us rejoice); the joy of heaven is too vast for the scribe's pen, truncated here to a mere breath of gladness.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
οτι ο υϊοϲ μου ουτοϲ νεκροϲ ην και ανε ην απολω απολωλοϲ ην και ευρεθη και ηρ ευφρενεϲθαι

**English Translation**
'Because this my son was dead and lived again; was lost, lost, and was found.' And they began to be merry.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of *απολω απολωλοϲ* (lost, lost) in the manuscript serves as a double witness to the utter hopelessness of his prior state. The return is not merely a geographic relocation but a resurrection (*ανε* for *ανεζησεν*). The chapter closes not with the son's labor, but with the Father's feast.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ο ϋϊοϲ αυτου ο πρεϲβυτεροϲ ε εν αγρω ˙ και ωϲ ερ ηγγιϲεν τη οικια ηκουϲεν ϲυμφωνιαϲ και χορων

**English Translation**
Now his son the elder was i- in [the] field; and as co- he drew near to the house he heard music and dancing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the location of the elder son. The scribe writes `ε εν` (i- in), a stutter that fixes him firmly `εν αγρω` (in the field). He is the man of labor, the one who seeks justification through the sweat of the brow, distant from the `οικια` (house) of grace. The text stumbles again at `ερ ηγγιϲεν` (co- he drew near), as if his approach to the Father's joy is hesitant and interrupted by his own self-righteousness. He hears the `ϲυμφωνιαϲ` (symphony/concord), yet he stands without, a worker in the field rather than a son at the table.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και προϲκα ενα των παιδων επ τι ειη ταυτα

**English Translation**
And call- one of the servants inq- what these things might be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is abbreviated, hasty. `προϲκα` stands for his calling out, and `επ` for his inquiry. He does not enter to see the mystery for himself; he demands an explanation from a servant. This is the nature of the legalist: he interrogates the operation of grace from a distance, seeking a logical reason (`τι ειη ταυτα`) for the joy of the Church, rather than participating in the mystery of the resurrection. He speaks to the slave because he possesses the spirit of a slave.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω ο ο αδελφοϲ ϲου η και εθυϲεν ο πατηρ ϲου τον μο τον ϲιτευτ ϲιτευτ οτι ϋγιαινοντα αυτον απελαβεν ˙

**English Translation**
And he said to him, The the brother of you c- [is come] and sacrificed thy father the ca- the fatted fatted because safe and sound him he received.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant is breathless with the excitement of the feast, as seen in the scribal repetitions. `ο ο αδελφοϲ` (the the brother) emphasizes the relationship the elder son wishes to forget. The text is broken: `η` stands for *hekei* (is come), and `τον μο` is a truncated *moschon* (calf). Most telling is the double inscription `ϲιτευτ ϲιτευτ` (fatted fatted). The abundance of God's mercy is so great that the scribe stammers over the richness of the offering. The Father has received the sinner `ϋγιαινοντα` (safe and sound/healthy), a restoration of the soul that the law could not achieve.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ωργιϲθη δε και ου ηθελεν ειϲελθ ειϲελθ ο δε πατηρ αυτου εξελθων παρεκα αυτον ·

**English Translation**
But he was angry and did not wish to ent- to enter; but the father of him coming out entre- him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Wrath (`ωργιϲθη`) is the response of the self-righteous to the abundance of grace. The scribe repeats `ειϲελθ ειϲελθ` (to enter, to enter), highlighting the obstinacy of the will; he is invited twice, yet refuses. In response to this hardness, the Father performs an act of supreme humility: `εξελθων` (coming out). Just as the Son came down from heaven for the lost, the Father comes out of the feast for the resentful. The truncated `παρεκα` (entreated) shows the unfinished nature of this plea; God begs the legalist to lay down his merits and accept joy, but the text leaves the action suspended.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει τω πατρι ϊδου τοϲαυτα ετη δου ϲοι και ου εντολην ϲου παρηλθον και εμοι ουδεποτε ε εριφον μετα των φιλων μου ευφρανθω

**English Translation**
But answering he s- to the father, Behold so many years I ser- thee and n- commandment of thee I passed by, and to me never g- a kid [that] with the friends of me I might make merry.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Listen to the accusation. `δου` is written for *douleuō* (I slave/serve). He views his sonship as slavery. He claims `ου` (n- [no]) commandment was passed by, a claim of perfection that blinds him. His petty jealousy is revealed in the stutter `ε εριφον` (a kid/goat). While the Father slays the fatted calf of the Atonement, the elder son haggles over a young goat. He desires merriment `μετα των φιλων μου` (with *my* friends), separating himself from the Father's friends. He wants a private reward for his works, not the shared joy of the family.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
οτε δε ο ϲου ου ο καταφαγων ϲου τον βιον μετα πορνων ηλθεν εθυϲαϲ αυτω τον ϲιτευτον μοϲχ

**English Translation**
But when the [son] of thee th- who devoured thy living with harlots came, thou sacrificedst for him the fatted cal-.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The bitterness disrupts the grammar. `ο ϲου ου` (the [son] of thee... that one) distances him further; he will not say "my brother," but "this son of yours." He defines the prodigal only by his sin: `ο καταφαγων` (the one having devoured). He is scandalized that the `ϲιτευτον μοϲχ` (fatted calf—here truncated to `μοϲχ`) is given to the unclean. He sees the grace of God as an injustice to his own labor. He does not understand that the sacrifice is not a payment for merit, but a medicine for the dead.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω τεκνον ϲυ παντο μετ εμου ει και π π τα εμα ϲα εϲτιν

**English Translation**
And he said to him, Child, thou alw- with me art, and a- a- all things mine thine are.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Father answers with tenderness, calling him `τεκνον` (child/bairn). `παντο` (truncated *pantote*) signifies "always." There has never been a moment where the Father was absent, yet the son felt alone in his servitude. The stutter `π π τα` (a- a- all things) emphasizes the totality of the inheritance. The elder son possesses everything the Father has, yet he starves himself on pride. The tragedy of the Pharisee is not that he has no inheritance, but that he possesses `παντα` (all things) and yet cannot enjoy them because he lacks love.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ευφρανθηναι δε και χαρηναι εδει οτι ο αδελφοϲ ϲου ουτοϲ νεκροϲ ην και εζηϲεν ανεζηϲεν απο απολωλοϲ ην και ευ ·

**English Translation**
But to make merry and to rejoice it was fitting, because the brother of thee this one dead was and lived lived again, lo- lost was and f-.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the theological summit. The scribe corrects `εζηϲεν` (lived) to `ανεζηϲεν` (lived again/revived). It is not merely survival; it is resurrection. The prodigal was `νεκροϲ` (dead) in trespasses, and is now alive in Christ. The stutter `απο απολωλοϲ` (lo- lost) reinforces the depth of his perdition. The final word `ευ` is cut short (for *heurethē* - was found). The sentence ends abruptly. The "finding" is proclaimed, but the elder son's response is unwritten. The Codex leaves us at the threshold: the brother is found, but will the elder son be found, or will he remain lost in his anger outside the house?
