**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου α εϲτ εϲτ του τα ϲκανδαλα μη ελθιν πλην ουαι δι ου ερχεται ˙

**English Translation**
And he said to his disciples, "[It is impossible] for the scandals not to come; but woe through whom it comes."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal struggle in the text (*α εϲτ εϲτ*), a stammering over the terrible inevitability of sin. The Lord declares that stumbling blocks (*skandala*) are woven into the present fallen age; it is an impossibility for them to be absent. Yet, necessity does not absolve the agent. The woe is pronounced not upon the existence of the trap, but upon the one who sets it. We must guard our hearts, for while the world must needs be full of snares, let not the snare be found in your own hand.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
λυϲιτελει αυτω ει λιθοϲ μυλικοϲ περικειται περι τ τραχηλον αυτου και ερρειπται ειϲ την θαλαϲϲαν η ϊ ϲκανδαλιϲη τ μικρων τουτων ενα ενα τ μικρων τουτων ενα ενα τ μικρων τουτων

**English Translation**
It profits him if a millstone lies around his neck and he has been thrown into the sea, than that he should scandalize one one of these little ones one one of these little ones.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here trembles with repetition (*ena ena...*), as if the scribe himself was seized by the terror of the warning. The Lord weighs the heaviest physical death—drowning by a millstone—against the spiritual murder of a "little one" (a believer of simple faith). The repetition in our Codex, "one one of these little ones," though a copyist's error, spiritually reinforces the singular, infinite value of each individual soul. To cause even one, just one, to fall is a calamity greater than personal destruction.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
προϲεχετε ε εαν αμαρ ο αδελφοϲ ϲου επιτιμηϲον αυτω και εαν μετανοη αφεϲ αυτω

**English Translation**
Pay attention [to yourselves]: if your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command *prosechete* (pay attention) is cut short, perhaps implying "to yourselves" (*eautois*). The order of discipline is precise: first, the watchfulness over one's own soul; second, the rebuke of the sin; third, the release of the debt upon repentance. We are not permitted to harbor malice in silence; the wound must be opened by rebuke so it may be closed by forgiveness (*aphes*).

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και εαν επτακιϲ τηϲ ημεραϲ αμαρτη ειϲ ϲε και επτακιϲ επι προϲ ϲε λε μετανοω α αυτω

**English Translation**
And if seven times in the day he sins against you, and seven times turns to you saying, "I repent," forgive him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The abbreviation *a* for *aphes* (forgive) suggests the haste with which mercy must be dispensed. The number seven signifies a complete cycle; even if the brother's instability is total, filling the whole day with offense and return, your stability in mercy must match it. We do not judge the sincerity of the "I repent"; we obey the command to release.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και ειπαν οι αποϲτολοι τω προϲθεϲ η πιϲτιν

**English Translation**
And the apostles said to the [Lord], "Add faith [to us]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Apostles, recognizing that the command to forgive repeatedly (Verse 4) exceeds human capacity, do not ask for patience or strength, but for *faith* (*pistin*). They understand that such radical charity requires a supernatural vision of God's economy. The text is brief here, stripping away titles, focusing solely on the desperate plea of the servant to the Master: "Increase what we lack."

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ο ει εχετε πι ωϲ κοκκον ϲιναπεωϲ ελεγε αν τη ϲυκαμινω εκριζωθητι και φυτευθητι εν τη θαλαϲϲη και ϋπη αν ϋμιν

**English Translation**
But the [Lord] said, "If you have faith like a grain of mustard, you would say to the sycamine tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord answers that quantity is not the issue, but quality. A mustard seed is small but contains the vital principle of life. The *sycamine*—a tree with deep, spreading roots—represents the deeply rooted grudges and bitterness that the Apostles feel they cannot forgive. Faith does not merely move mountains of earth; it uproots the impossible rigidity of the human heart and casts it into the sea of God's mercy.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
τιϲ δε εξ υμων δου εχων αροτρι η ποιμαι οϲ ειϲελθ εκ του αγρου ερει αυτω ευθεωϲ πα αναπε

**English Translation**
But who of you having a slave plowing or shepherding, who having entered from the field, will say to him, "Immediately come, recline"?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here Christ establishes the hierarchy of service to crush the pride of the Apostles. We are the *doulon* (slave). Whether we are plowing (evangelizing) or shepherding (pastoring), we are merely performing our function. When we return from the "field" of ministry, we should not expect immediate comfort or praise from God. The servant exists for the Master, not the Master for the servant.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ουχϊ ερει αυ ετοιμαϲον μοι τι διπνηϲω και περιζωϲαμε διακονι μοι εωϲ φαγω και πι και μετα ταυτα φαγεϲε και πιεϲε ϲυ ·

**English Translation**
But will he not say to him, "Prepare what I may sup, and having girded yourself serve me until I eat and drink; and after these things you will eat and you will drink"?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The posture of the Christian is one of being "girded" (*perizosamenos*), ready to serve the Lord's pleasure before attending to one's own needs. The spiritual sequence is vital: first the Lord is satisfied by our obedience, and only *meta tauta* (after these things) do we find our own sustenance. Our spiritual food comes from doing the will of the Father, not from the rest that follows.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
μη εχι χαριν τω δουλω οτι εποιηϲεν τα διαταχθεντα

**English Translation**
Does he have thanks to the slave because he did the things commanded?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A piercing question. Does God owe us *charin* (grace/thanks) for our obedience? God forbid. We do not place the Creator in our debt by refraining from sin or by performing good works. These are merely *ta diatachthenta*—the things commanded. To think we deserve special praise for doing our duty is the height of arrogance.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ϋ ουτωϲ κ(αι) ϋμειϲ οταν ποιηϲηται τα διαταχθεντα ϋμιν ουτωϲ κ(αι) ϋμειϲ οταν ποιηϲηται παντα τα διαταχθεντα ϋ λεγετε οτι δου αχριοι εϲμεν ο ωφειλαμεν ωφειλομεν ωφειλομεν ποι πεποιηκα

**English Translation**
So also you, when you do the things commanded you—so also you when you do all the things commanded you—say that "We are useless slaves; what we owed we owed we owed to do, we have done."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript bears witness to a profound agitation here. The scribe writes the condition twice ("when you do the things... when you do *all* the things"), and then stammers on the word "owed" (*opheilomen*) three times. This is the stuttering of the soul before the vastness of God. Even if we do *panta* (all things), we remain *achrioi* (without profit/surplus merit). We have simply paid back the debt of our existence. The triple repetition of "we owed" in our Codex serves as a liturgical chant of humility: we are debtors, debtors, debtors.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω πορευεϲθαι ειϲ ϊ και αυτοϲ διηρχετο δια μεϲον ϲαμα και γαλιλαιαϲ

**English Translation**
And it happened in the going to Jerusalem, he also was passing through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord sets His face toward Jerusalem (*Ierousalem*), the place of sacrifice. His path cuts "through the midst" of Samaria and Galilee—a borderland between the orthodox and the heretic/foreigner. It is in this liminal space, where boundaries are blurred, that the grace of God often manifests most clearly, preparing us for the inclusion of the "stranger" in the following verses.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και ειϲερχομενου αυτου ειϲ τινα κω ϋπηντηϲ αυτω δεκα λεπροι ανδρεϲ οι εϲτηϲαν πορρωθεν

**English Translation**
And as he was entering into a certain village, ten leprous men met him, who stood from afar.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They met Him (*upentesan*), yet they stood afar off (*porrothen*). This is the paradox of the Law and Grace. The Law commands the leper to separate himself, to stand distant. Grace draws them to "meet" Him. They are ten—a number of testimony. Their physical distance signifies the spiritual alienation of humanity, waiting for the High Priest to bridge the gap that the Law could only measure but not close.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοι ηραν την φων λεγοντεϲ επι ελεηϲον ημαϲ

**English Translation**
And they themselves lifted up the voice, saying: Master, have mercy on us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the collective desperation of the lepers. The scribe records *autoi* (they themselves), emphasizing their united agency in misery. They lift up *phon*—an abbreviation for *phonen* (voice)—acting as one body of suffering. They cry out *Epi*, a suspended form of *Epistata* (Master/Commander). They do not approach the Lord with the intimacy of "Jesus" but with the title of authority, acknowledging His power to command their unclean flesh. The prayer is brief, as befits those in pain: "Have mercy on us." They ask not for gold, but for the mercy that restores life.

**Verse 14**


**Greek Text**
και ϊδων ειπεν αυτοιϲ πορευθεν επιδιξατε εαυ τοιϲ ϊερευϲιν ˙ και εγενετο εν τω αυτουϲ εκαθαριϲθηϲαν ˙

**English Translation**
And seeing, He said to them: Having gone, show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass in the [going] of them, they were cleansed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord does not touch them but commands obedience. *Poreuthen* (having gone) is the condition of the cure; faith is proven in motion. He sends them to the *hiereusin* (priests), upholding the Law even as He transcends it. The text reads *en to autous* (in the [time/act] of them), omitting the verb of motion, yet the result is immediate: *ekatharisthesan* (they were cleansed). The miracle occurs not in the asking, but in the obeying. The cleansing happens "in the midst" of their journey, teaching us that grace often overtakes us while we walk the path of duty.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ειϲ δε εξ αυτων ϊδων οτι ϊαθη ϋ μετα φωνηϲ μεγαληϲ δοξαζων τον ˙

**English Translation**
But one of them, seeing that he was healed, returned with a loud voice glorifying God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ten were sent, but the text isolates *heis* (one). Seeing his own flesh restored (*iathe*), he performs a turn—indicated by the abbreviation *hy* for *hypestrepsen* (returned). He does not whisper; he uses a *phones megales* (great voice). Before, he lifted his voice for mercy; now, he uses the same volume for glory. The object of his praise is abbreviated as *ton* (the [God]), signifying that in his healing, he recognized the Divine presence. Gratitude turns the healed man back toward the Source.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και επεϲεν επι προϲωπον πα τουϲ ποδαϲ αυ ευχαριϲτων αυτω και αυτοϲ ϲαμαριτηϲ ˙ και επεϲεν επι προ παρα τουϲ ποδαϲ αυτου ευ αυτω και αυτοϲ ην ϲα ·

**English Translation**
And he fell upon [his] face at His feet giving thanks to Him, and he was a Samaritan. And he fell upon [his] face at His feet giving thanks to Him, and he was a Samaritan.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold a mystery in the manuscript! The scribe has written the event twice, a doubling that serves—whether by divine intent or human frailty—to emphasize the prostration of the foreigner. Twice he falls (*epesen*), twice he is at the feet (*podas*), and twice he is identified as a *Samarites*. This repetition underscores the shock that an alien, a heretic in the eyes of the Jews, is the one to perform the true liturgy of thanksgiving. He falls on his face, the posture of total submission, grounding his gratitude in humility.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ειπεν ουχι οι δεκα εκαθαριϲθη οι δε εννεα που

**English Translation**
And answering, Jesus said: Were not the ten cleansed? But the nine, where [are they]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord, marked here simply as *O* (The [Jesus]), asks a rhetorical question that pierces the soul. *Ouchi oi deka* (were not the ten) cleansed? The number is complete in the miracle but fractured in the thanksgiving. *Oi de ennea pou*—"The nine, where?" This interrogative hangs over all humanity. God pours out mercies in fullness (the ten), but the return of praise is scarce (the one). The silence of the nine is a loud indictment of ingratitude.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ουχ ευρεθη ϋποϲτρεψαν δουναι δοξ τω ει μη ο αλ ουτοϲ

**English Translation**
Were they not found returning to give glory to God, except this foreigner?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The condemnation continues. *Ouch eurethe* (Were they not found). The purpose of the healing was *dounai dox[an] to [theo]* (to give glory to God). The abbreviation *al* stands for *allogenes* (foreigner/alien born). It is a stinging rebuke to the house of Israel that only the stranger recognized the time of visitation. The "foreigner" is often more perceptive of grace because he claims no entitlement to it.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτω α πορευου η πιϲτιϲ ϲου ϲεϲω ϲε ·

**English Translation**
And He said to him: Arise, go; thy faith has saved thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command *A*—abbreviated for *Anastas* (Arise)—resurrects the man from his prostration. He is told to *poreuou* (go), but with a new assurance. The others were cleansed physically, but this man hears *he pistis sou seso[ken] se* (thy faith has saved thee). The verb *sesoken* implies a salvation deeper than skin; it is the restoration of the whole person. His gratitude was the evidence of his saving faith.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
επερωτηθειϲ δε ϋπο των φαριϲαι ποτε ερχεται η βαϲιλια του απεκριθη αυτοιϲ και ειπεν ουκ ερ η βαϲιλεια του μετα παρα

**English Translation**
And being asked by the Pharisees when comes the kingdom of God, He answered them and said: The kingdom of God comes not with observation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *Pharisai* (Pharisees) demand a timeline for the *Basilia tou [Theou]* (Kingdom of God). They look for signs, for armies, for pomp. The Lord answers that it does not come *meta para*—an abbreviation for *meta paratereseos* (with hostile watching or careful observation). One cannot calculate the arrival of God's reign as one tracks the stars. It is not a spectacle for the eyes but a reality for the spirit.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ουδε ερουϲιν ωδε η εκει ϊδου γαρ η βαϲιλεια του εν ϋμων εϲτιν

**English Translation**
Neither shall they say: Here! or There! For behold, the kingdom of God is within you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He dismantles their spatial expectations. They cannot point and say *hode* (here) or *ekei* (there). The reason is the great mystery: *entos hymon estin* (it is within you). The Kingdom is not a territory to be conquered but an inner presence to be cultivated. It exists *entos*—in the midst of you, or inside your hearts. The Christ stands among them, and the Spirit dwells within the faithful; this is the seat of the Empire of God.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ ελευϲ ημεραι οτε επι μιαν των ημερων του ϋϊου του ανθρωπου ϊδειν και ουκ οψε

**English Translation**
And He said to the disciples: Days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and ye shall not see [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He turns from the Pharisees to the *mathetas* (disciples). A time of longing approaches. *Eleus[ontai]* (they will come), the days of absence. The text uses *epi* for *epithymesete* (ye shall desire/long for). In the tribulations to come, the church will ache for just *mian* (one) of the days of the *Hyiou tou Anthropou* (Son of Man)—a day of His visible power and comfort. But *ouk opse* (ye shall not see [it]); the era of faith requires walking without sight, enduring the silence of the heavens.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και ερουϲιν ϋμιν εκει και ϊδου ωδε μη απελ μητε διω

**English Translation**
And they shall say to you: [Lo] there, and behold here; go not away, nor follow.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In their desperation, false guides will arise. They will shout *ekei* (there) and *hode* (here). The command is strict: *me apel*—abbreviated for *me apelthete* (do not go away)—and *mete dio*—for *mete dioxete* (nor follow/pursue). We must not run after every rumor of Christ's return. Stability is the virtue of the believer; we wait in the truth we have received, not chasing the novelties of deceivers.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ωϲπερ γαρ η αϲτραπη αϲτρα εκ τηϲ τον ουρανον ειϲ την ϋπ ουρανον λαμπει ουτωϲ εϲται ο του αν εν τη η αυτου

**English Translation**
For just as the lightning flashing out of the [region] under heaven shines unto the [region] under heaven, so shall be the Son of Man in His day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The true coming requires no guide to point it out. It is like *astrapen* (lightning). The text reads *astra* for *astraptousa* (flashing). It lights up the cosmos from one end *ek tes ton ouranon* to the other. It is undeniable, sudden, and all-encompassing. *Outos estai* (so shall be) the *Hyiou tou Anthropou* (Son of Man) *en te he[mera] autou* (in His day). There will be no secret knowledge, only the blinding revelation of the Judge of all.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
πρω δε δει αυτον πολλα παθιν και αποδοκιμαϲθη απο τηϲ γενε ταυτηϲ

**English Translation**
But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things and to be rejected by this generation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine order established by the word *δει* (it is necessary). Before the lightning of the Parousia can flash, the shadow of the Cross must fall. The Lord instructs us that suffering (*παθιν*) is not an accident of history but a prerequisite of glory. He is to be rejected (*αποδοκιμαϲθη*) specifically by "this generation" (*τηϲ γενε ταυτηϲ*), a phrase denoting not merely the contemporaries of His flesh, but the enduring spirit of the world that refuses the humility of God.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και καθωϲ καϲ̣ωϲ εγενε εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ νωε ουτωϲ εϲται και εν ταιϲ ημε του υϊου του ανθρωπου

**English Translation**
And just as [just as] it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe’s hesitation—writing *καθωϲ* and then stumbling into *καϲ̣ωϲ*—mirrors the stumbling of the soul when confronted with this terrifying parallel. The days of the Son of Man (*του υϊου του ανθρωπου*) shall not announce themselves with trumpets beforehand, but shall mirror the ancient days of Noah. The terror lies in the normalcy; the world continues in its rhythm until the very moment the divine intervention shatters time.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ηϲθι επινον εγαμο εγαμο εγαμιζοντο αχρι ηϲ ημεραϲ ειϲηλ νωε ειϲ την κιβωτον και ηλθεν ο κατακλυϲμοϲ και ηρεν απανταϲ

**English Translation**
They were eating, drinking, marrying [marrying], being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and took them all away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the text stammers *εγαμο εγαμο* (marrying, marrying), as if to capture the frenetic, repetitive cycle of carnal life. They were consumed by the preservation of the species and the pleasures of the flesh, blind to the spiritual horizon. The entry of Noah into the ark (*κιβωτον*) is the hinge of history; once the righteous are separated, the *κατακλυϲμοϲ* (flood) is inevitable and total (*απανταϲ*).

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ομοιωϲ καθωϲ ε εν ταιϲ η λωτʼ · ηϲθι επινον ηγορα επωλουν · εφυτευον ωκο

**English Translation**
Likewise just as it [happened] in the days of Lot: they were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord shifts the image from the biological to the economic and civil. In Sodom, they were not only eating but *ηγορα επωλουν* (buying, selling) and *ωκο* (building). This abbreviation for *ωκοδομουν* suggests the incompleteness of their earthly cities. They plant and build on ground destined for fire, a warning to those of us who invest our souls in the permanence of masonry and commerce.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
η δε ημε εξηλθεν λωτ απο ϲοδομων ε πυρ και θι απ ουρανου κ(αι) απωλεϲεν απαν

**English Translation**
But on the day Lot went out from Sodom, it [rained] fire and sulfur from heaven and destroyed [them] all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of the righteous man acts as a dam against the wrath of God. The moment Lot *εξηλθεν* (went out), the protection was removed. The text abbreviates the rain of fire (*ε πυρ*) and sulfur (*θι*), hastening the narrative just as the judgment hastens upon the wicked. The destruction comes *απ ουρανου* (from heaven), proving that no earthly fortress can withstand a judgment that falls from above.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
κατα ταυτα τα αυτα ε η ημερα · ο του ανθρωπου απο

**English Translation**
According to these very things it [will be] on the day the Son of Man is [revealed].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is stark and abbreviated (*ε* for *εϲται*, *απο* for *αποκαλυπτεται*), stripping the prophecy to its bones. *Κατα ταυτα* (according to these things)—the pattern is immutable. The revelation of the Son of Man is not a new dispensation but the fulfillment of the archetypes of Noah and Lot. When He is revealed (*απο*), the veil of commerce and carnal security is torn away.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
εν ε τη ημερα οϲ εϲται επι του δω και τα ϲκευ αυτου εν τη οι αυτου μη κα αραι αυτα και ο εν αγρω ομοι μη επιϲτρε ειϲ τα οπιϲω

**English Translation**
In that day, whoever shall be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them; and the one in the field likewise, let him not turn to the things behind.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *δω* (housetop) signifies the height of contemplation and prayer. If the soul is found there when the Lord comes, it must not descend into the *οι* (house)—the lower faculties—to retrieve *ϲκευ* (vessels/goods). To turn back (*επιϲτρε ειϲ τα οπιϲω*) is to prefer the created thing to the Creator at the moment of final decision. Detachment must be absolute.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
μνημονευεται τηϲ γυναικοϲ λωτ

**English Translation**
Remember the wife of Lot.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A command of three words in the Greek, terrifying in its brevity. She is the monument of the divided heart. She was physically removed from Sodom, but her will remained within its walls. We are commanded to *μνημονευεται* (remember) her, for many baptized souls have left the city of sin with their feet but dwell there with their eyes.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
οϲ δαν εαν ζητη την ψυχην αυ ϲωϲαι απολεϲι αυτην οϲ δ αν α ζωογονη αυτην

**English Translation**
Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, but whoever [loses it] will preserve it alive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the central paradox of our faith. To clutch the *ψυχην* (soul/life) tightly in this age is to strangle it. The scribe’s correction from *δαν* to *εαν* shows the universal application: "if ever" anyone tries this. The promise is that the one who loses it for Christ *ζωογονη*—literally, "will birth it into life." Martyrdom is not death, but a birth pang.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
λεγω ϋμιν ταυτη τη νυκτι εϲονται δυο επι κλινηϲ μιαϲ ο ειϲ παρα κ(αι) ὁ ετεροϲ αφεθη

**English Translation**
I say to you, on this night there will be two on one bed; the one [will be taken] and the other will be left.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment pierces the intimacy of the *κλινηϲ* (bed). Even the closest human union cannot merge two souls into one destiny before the Judgment Seat. *Ο ειϲ παρα* (the one is taken)—assumed into the company of the elect—while the other is left (*αφεθη*) in the darkness they chose. God distinguishes what human eyes see as one.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
εϲονται δυο αληθουϲαι επι το αυτο η μια παραλημφθηϲεται η δε ετερα αφεθηϲετ(αι)

**English Translation**
There will be two grinding at the same place; the one will be taken, but the other will be left.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As with rest, so with labor. Two women work at the mill (*αληθουϲαι*), performing the exact same external action. Yet, the inward disposition separates them by an infinite gulf. One grinds with a heart lifted to God, the other with a heart weighed down by the earth. The external form of life does not save; only the hidden man of the heart determines who is *παραλημφθηϲεται* (taken).

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθεντεϲ λεγουϲιν αυτω που ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ οπου το ϲω εκει και οι αε επιϲυναχθη

**English Translation**
And answering they say to him, "Where [Lord]?" But he said to them, "Where the body is, there also the eagles will be gathered."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples, still thinking in terms of geography, ask *που* (where?). The Lord answers with a mystery. *Οπου το ϲω* (where the body is)—this may signify the carcass of a sinful world attracting the eagles of judgment. Yet, for us of the deeper understanding, it signifies the Body of Christ, the slain Lamb. Where the Corpus is, there the *αε* (eagles)—the saints who soar to high places—are gathered (*επιϲυναχθη*) to feed upon the Life that comes from death.
