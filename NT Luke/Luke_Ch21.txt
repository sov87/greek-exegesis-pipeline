**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
αναβλεψαϲ δε ειδ ειδ τουϲ βαλλονταϲ ειϲ το γαζοφυλακιον τα δωρα αυτων πλου

**English Translation**
And looking up he saw saw those casting into the treasury the gifts of them rich [ones]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the gaze of the Lord. The scribe writes *eid eid* (saw saw), a stutter of the pen, yet let us read it as the intensity of His vision. He does not merely glance; He sees deeply. He beholds the rich casting in their gifts, yet the word for "rich" (*plou*) is cut short, abbreviated. Is this not fitting? For the wealth of this world is truncated in the eyes of God, incomplete and fleeting, possessing no fullness in the Kingdom.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ειδεν δε τι χηραν πενιχρ πενιχρ βαλλουϲαν εκει λεπτα δυο

**English Translation**
But he saw a certain widow poor poor casting there two lepta

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the text doubles the word for her poverty: *penichr penichr*. The scribe repeats the condition of her lack. She is not merely poor; she is doubly destitute, emphasized by the repetition. Yet, in this abyss of want, she acts. She casts "two lepta." She does not hold back one for herself. The duality of her poverty is met by the duality of her gift—two coins, a total surrender.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αληθωϲ λεγω ϋμιν οτι η χηρα αυτη η πτω πλεον παντ εβαλεν

**English Translation**
And he said, Truly I say to you that this widow the poor [one] cast more than all

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord changes her title. Before she was *penichran* (needy), now He calls her *ptochos* (beggar/abjectly poor). He elevates her status by revealing the depth of her emptiness. And behold the paradox of the Gospel: the *ptochos* casts *pleon* (more). The mathematics of heaven weighs not the gold, but the sacrifice. "More than all" (*pant*)—she outweighs the collective treasury of the temple.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
παντεϲ γαρ ουτοι εκ του περιϲϲευ αυτοιϲ εβα ειϲ τα δωρα αυ δε εκ του ϋϲτερη αυτηϲ παν τον βιον ον ει εβαλεν ·

**English Translation**
For all these out of the abundance to them cast into the gifts; but she out of the want of her, all the life which she had, she cast.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the contrast: *perisseu* (abundance) against *hysterē* (want). The rich give from the overflow, the froth of their cup; she gives the dregs. The Greek says she cast *pan ton bion*—"all the life." Not merely money, but her very substance, her breath, her sustenance. She deposited her life into the treasury of God, trusting Him to be her keeper.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και ‾̷‾ τι λεγοντων περι του ϊερου οτι λιθοιϲ καλοιϲ μεγαλοιϲ καλοιϲ και αναθεμαϲιν κεκο ειπεν

**English Translation**
And [some] saying concerning the temple that with stones beautiful great beautiful and votive offerings it has been adorned, he said:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eyes of men are seduced by masonry. The text repeats *kalois* (beautiful) twice: "stones beautiful great beautiful." The disciples are stuttering with admiration for the marble. They see the *megalois* (great things) of earth. They see the *keko* (adornment). But the Lord speaks into this cacophony of aesthetic praise to silence it with the dust of the future.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ταυ α θεορειτε θεωρειτε ελευ ημεραι ε αιϲ ουκ αφεθη λιθοϲ επι λι λιθον ωδε οϲ ου κα

**English Translation**
These things which you behold behold, days will come in which there will not be left a stone upon st... stone here which will not be [thrown down]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe corrects *theoreite* (behold), writing it first with an Omicron, then an Omega. We must truly "behold behold." Look twice, for the first look sees glory, but the second sees ruin. The text stumbles: *lithos epi li lithon* (stone upon st... stone). Even the letters pile up and tumble. The structure is unstable. Whatever is built by hands, even the Temple of God, if it becomes an idol, shall be dismantled.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
επηρω δε αυτον λε διδαϲκαλε ποτε ουν ουν ταυτα εϲ και τι το ϲημι οταν μελλη ταυτα γεινεϲθαι

**English Translation**
But they asked him saying, Teacher, when therefore therefore will these things be? And what the sign when these things are about to happen?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Anxiety breeds repetition. They ask *oun oun* (therefore therefore). They are desperate for a timeline. They call Him *Didaskale* (Teacher), yet they seek the office of a soothsayer. They ask for a *sēmi* (sign), their faith requiring sight. They wish to know "when," but Christ wishes them to know "how" to stand.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπ βλεπετε μη πλανη πολλοι γαρ ε επι τω ονοματι μου λε εγω ειμι κ(αι) κ(αι) ο κ(αι)ροϲ ηγγικεν μη πορευθηται οπιϲω αυτων

**English Translation**
And he said, See that you be not led astray; for many will come in my name saying, I am [he], and and the time has drawn near; do not go after them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The danger is *planē* (deception/wandering). The deceivers claim the Name and the Time. The text reads *k(ai) k(ai)* (and and)—a stutter in the mouth of the false prophet, rushing to declare "the time has drawn near." Do not follow the urgency of men who claim God's authority. The command is *mē poreuthētai*—do not journey after them. Stay fixed on the Rock, not the rumors.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
οταν δε ακουϲηται πολεμουϲ και ακα μη πτοη δει γαρ ταυτα γενεϲθαι πρωτον αλλ ουκ ευθεωϲ το τελοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And when you hear of wars and disorders, do not be terrified; for these things must happen first, but not immediately the end.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word *aka* stands for *akatastasias*—instabilities, confusions, disorders. When the world loses its order, the Christian must not lose his heart. *Mē ptoē*—do not be fluttered or terrified. The scribe places a high stop after *telos* (end). There is a pause. The end is not "immediately." We must endure the interval of chaos with the patience of the saints.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
τοτε ελεγεν αυτοιϲ εγερθηϲε εθνοϲ επ εθνοϲ και βαϲιλεια επι βα

**English Translation**
Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against ki[ngdom]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rising (*egerthesetai*) of nations is the fever of the earth. The text cuts off the second mention of "kingdom" at *ba*. It is a profound silence. Kingdom against... nothing. Earthly kingdoms destroy one another until they are truncated, abbreviated into dust. They rise only to fall short.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ϲειϲμοι τε μεγαλοι και κατα τοπουϲ λειμοι και λοιμοι εϲονται φο τε και ϲημι μεγαλα απ ουρα εϲται

**English Translation**
And earthquakes great, and in places famines and pestilences there will be; and terrors and signs great from heaven there will be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Hear the rhyme of judgment: *leimoi* (famines) and *loimoi* (pestilences). They go hand in hand; hunger breeds plague. The manuscript speaks of *pho*—an abbreviation for *phobētra* (terrors/fearful sights). Some things are too terrible to write in full. The cosmos itself shakes (*seismoi*), and the heavens send down signs. The stability of the ground is removed so that we might look only *ap oura* (from heaven).

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
προ δε του παντων επι επ αυτουϲ εφ ϋμαϲ ταϲ χιραϲ αυτων και διωξουϲιν πα ειϲ ταϲ ϲυναγωγαϲ και φυ απαγομε επι βαϲιλειϲ και ηγεμοναϲ ενε του ονοματοϲ μου

**English Translation**
But before all these things they will lay upon lay upon [them] upon you their hands and persecute, delivering [you] into the synagogues and prisons, being led away before kings and governors for the sake of my name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the correction of the Spirit in the hand of the scribe. It was written *ep autous* (upon them), but corrected to *eph hymas* (upon you). The persecution is not a distant theory for "them"; it is for *you*. The hands (*chiras*) of the world seize the believer. You shall be led (*apagome*) like captives. But note the cause: *hene tou onomatos mou*—for the sake of My Name. The suffering has a purpose; it is the seal of your belonging to Him.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
αποβηϲεται δε ϋμιν ειϲ μαρτυρι

**English Translation**
But it shall turn out for you into a testimony.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine economy of persecution. The Lord uses the word *apobēsetai* (it will result/turn out), indicating that the chaos of the world is subject to the order of Providence. The tribulations you face are not accidents, but are teleological; they lead *eis martyrion* (into a testimony). As a bishop, I instruct you: do not view the tribunal of the magistrate as a place of defeat, but as a pulpit. The suffering of the saints is the raw material of their witness.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
θετε ουν εν ταιϲ καρδι ϋμων μη προ απολογη ˙

**English Translation**
Place therefore in your hearts not to premeditate making a defense.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is decisive: *thete* (place/settle). The location of this resolve is *en tais kardi[ais]* (in the hearts), abbreviated here by the scribe, showing the centrality of the inner man. We are forbidden *pro[meletan]* (to premeditate) our *apologē* (defense). This strikes against human pride which seeks security in rhetoric and prepared speeches. Christ demands a radical emptiness in the moment of trial, that He may fill it. We must settle our hearts on Him, rather than settling our minds on a script.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
εγω γαρ δωϲω ϋμ ϋμ ϲτομα και ϲοφιαν η ου δυνηϲονται αντιϲτηναι η αν παντεϲ οι αντικειμενοι υμ υμ

**English Translation**
For I will give to you [you] a mouth and wisdom which all those opposing you [you] shall not be able to withstand or contradict.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here stammers with intensity, repeating *ym[in]* (to you) twice at the beginning and end, emphasizing the personal nature of the gift. It is the *Ego* (I)—Christ Himself—who acts as the donor of the *stoma* (mouth/utterance). The wisdom given is not learned in the academies but infused by the Spirit. The *antikeimenoi* (opposers) are rendered powerless; they cannot stand against (*antistēnai*) the divine logic. When the martyr speaks, the Judge speaks through him.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
παραδοθηϲεϲθε δε και και ϋπο γονε και αδελφων και ϲυγγενων και φι και θανατω εξ υμων

**English Translation**
But you shall be betrayed even [even] by parents and brothers and kinsmen and friends; and they shall put [some] of you to death.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe’s repetition of *kai* (and/even) underscores the shock of this unnatural treachery. The list dismantles the most sacred natural bonds: *gone[ōn]* (parents), *adelphōn* (brothers). The Gospel cuts across bloodlines. We must be prepared for the *paradothēsesthe* (betrayal) to come from the hearth itself. The outcome for some is *thanatō[sousin]* (they will put to death). The Church is a family that transcends the biological family, often at the cost of the latter.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και εϲεϲθαι μιϲου υπο παντ δια το ονομα μου

**English Translation**
And you shall be hated by all because of my name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Esesthe* (you shall be) marks a continuous state of existence for the faithful. The hatred is universal (*ypo pant[ōn]*), yet the cause is singular and specific: *dia to onoma mou* (on account of my Name). The world does not hate us for our own sake, but because we bear the mark of the Anointed One. To be *misou[menoi]* (hated) by the world is a confirmation of our belonging to Christ. Wear this hatred as a badge of honor.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και θριξ εκ τηϲ κε ϋμων ου μη αποληται ˙

**English Translation**
And a hair from your head shall by no means perish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is a divine paradox. Verse 16 prophesies death, yet here the Lord promises that not a *thrix* (hair) from the *ke[phalēs]* (head) shall perish (*apolētai*). How can this be? It is because the true man is hidden in Christ. The persecutor may destroy the body, but the resurrection guarantees the restoration of the whole person. God’s accounting of His saints is so precise that even the smallest filament is numbered and preserved in His memory for the Last Day.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
εν τη ϋ ϋμων κτηϲαϲθαι ταϲ ψυ ϋμων ˙

**English Translation**
In your patience acquire your souls.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates *y[pomonē]* (patience/endurance). The verb *ktēsasthai* is an imperative: acquire! possess! By standing firm when the world shakes, we take possession of our own *psych[as]* (souls). The coward loses his soul to fear; the apostate sells his soul for safety; but the martyr, through endurance, gains his soul for eternity. Salvation is an active persistence, not a passive waiting.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
οταν δε ϊδητε κυκλου ϲτρα ι τοτε γνωτε οτι ηγ η ερημωϲιϲ αυτηϲ ˙

**English Translation**
But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe uses heavy abbreviation: *stra* for *strato[pedōn]* (armies/encampments) and *I* for *I[erousalem]*. The sign is visible: *kyklou[menēn]* (being circled). The spiritual reality is *erēmōsis* (desolation). The earthly Temple, once the dwelling of God, is abandoned to the Gentiles. We must learn to read the signs of history; when the physical structures of religion are besieged, know that the glory has already departed, and judgment is at the door.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
τοτε οι εν τη ϊουδαι φευγετωϲαν ειϲ τα ορη και οι εν με αυτηϲ εκχωρι και οι εν ταιϲ χωραιϲ μη ειϲερχε ειϲ αυτ

**English Translation**
Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, and those in the midst of her depart, and those in the country [places] not enter into her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is centrifugal: flee away from the center. *Pheugetōsan* (let them flee) to the mountains. Those *en mesō* (in the midst) must *ekchōri[tōsan]* (withdraw). The holy city has become a trap. There is a time to stand and testify (v. 13), and a time to flee (v. 21). Wisdom discerns the difference. We must not cling to earthly geography when God has decreed its destruction.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
οτι ημεραι εκδικη αυται του πλη παντα τα γεγραμμενα

**English Translation**
Because these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all things that have been written.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The destruction is not random chaos; it is *ekdikē[seōs]* (vengeance/vindication). It serves a scriptural purpose: *tou plē[rōthēnai]* (to be fulfilled). The *gegrammena* (written things) refer to the prophetic warnings of the Old Covenant. God is faithful to His word, even when that word is a word of judgment against His own people. History is the unfolding of the scroll.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ουαι δε ταιϲ εν γαϲτρι εχουϲαιϲ και ταιϲ θηλαζουϲαιϲ εν ε ταιϲ ημεραιϲ εϲτε γαρ εν εκιναιϲ ταιϲ ημεραιϲ αναγ μεγαλη επι τηϲ γηϲ και οργη τω λαω τουτω

**English Translation**
But woe to those having in the womb [pregnant] and to those nursing in those days; for there shall be in those days great distress upon the land and wrath to this people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord’s compassion breaks through in the *ouai* (woe/alas). He sees the suffering of the most vulnerable—mothers and infants. The scribe repeats "in those days" (*en ekinais tais ēmerais*), emphasizing the specific temporal locus of this *anag[kē]* (distress/necessity). The *orgē* (wrath) is directed specifically *tō laō toutō* (to this people). It is a fearful thing when the covenant people become the object of divine wrath due to their rejection of the Messiah.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και πεϲουνται ϲτο μαχαιραϲ και αιχμαλωτιϲθηϲ αιχμαλωτιϲθηϲ ειϲ τα εθνη π π και ι εϲται πατουμενη εθνων αχρι ου πληρωθωϲιν και εθνων

**English Translation**
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led captive [led captive] into all the nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by nations until the times of nations are fulfilled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is heavy with the weight of judgment. The scribe writes *aichmalōtisthēs[ontai]* (they shall be led captive) twice, a dittography that inadvertently reinforces the certainty of the exile. *I[erousalem]* is *patoumenē* (trampled) by the *ethnōn* (nations). Yet, look at the horizon: *achri ou* (until). The trampling has a limit. The *kairoi* (times) of the Gentiles will be fulfilled (*plērōthōsin*). God has set a boundary for the dominion of the nations; the City of God remains eternal while earthly cities rise and fall.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και εϲονται ϲημι εν ηλιω και ϲε και αϲτροιϲ και επι τηϲ γηϲ ϲυ εθνων και εν απορια ηχουϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ και ϲα

**English Translation**
And there shall be signs in sun and [moon] and stars and upon the earth [distress] of nations and in perplexity of the sound of the sea and [billows].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the fragmentation of the cosmos reflected even in the scribe's hand. The text reads *ϲημι* for signs and *ϲε* for the moon (*σελήνη*), as if the heavenly lights are already dimming. The nations are held in *ϲυ*—likely *synochē*, a holding-together of anguish. The roar of the deep concludes with *ϲα*, implying the *salos* (tossing) of the waves. The creation which groaned in birth pangs now groans in dissolution; the sea, often an emblem of chaos in our Scriptures, reasserts its terrifying voice before the end.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
αποψυχοντ ανθρωπων απο φοβου και προϲ των επαρ επερχομενων τη οι αι γαρ δυναμιϲ των ου ϲαλευθη

**English Translation**
Men fainting from fear and expectation of the things coming upon the [inhabited world]; for the powers of the [heavens] shall be shaken.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word *αποψυχοντ* (fainting) suggests the soul (*psychē*) is being breathed out from sheer terror. The scribe stumbles at *επαρ* before correcting to *επερχομενων* (coming upon), mirroring the confusion of the times. The shaking extends to the *δυναμιϲ* (powers) of the *ου* (heavens/ouranōn); not merely earthly kingdoms, but the angelic principalities and the physical firmament are destabilized. When the roof of the world shakes, the inhabitants of the *oikoumenē* (inhabited world, here abbreviated *τη οι*) have no shelter but God.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε τ οψονται τον του ανθρω ερχομενον εν νεφελη μετα δυναμεωϲ και δο πολληϲ

**English Translation**
And then they shall see the [Son] of Man coming in a cloud with power and much glory.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the theophany. The text abbreviates the title to *τον του ανθρω* (the [Son] of the Man), focusing on His humanity which is now glorified. He comes *εν νεφελη* (in a cloud), the chariot of the Divine Presence seen in the Exodus. The *δο* (glory/doxēs) is *πολληϲ* (much/great). The world faints in the previous verse, but here the faithful gaze upon the Power that supersedes the shaking heavens.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
αρχο δε τουτ γεινεϲθαι ανακυ και επαρατε ταϲ κεφαλαϲ ϋμων διοτι εγγιζει η α ϋμ ϋμ

**English Translation**
But when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A command of posture. While the wicked bow in fear, the Church is commanded *ανακυ* (to look up). The scribe repeats *ϋμ* (your) twice at the end (*ϋμ ϋμ*), emphatically sealing the promise: the redemption (*η α*, likely *apolytrosis*) is specifically *yours*. It is a paradox that the time of greatest destruction is the time of nearest redemption.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν παραβο αυτοιϲ ϊδετε την ϲυκην και π π τα δενδρα

**English Translation**
And He spoke a parable to them: See the fig tree and [all] the trees.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord points to the book of nature. The *ϲυκην* (fig tree) is the specific sign of Israel, but the addition of "and [all] the trees" (where the scribe stutters *π π* for *panta*) universalizes the lesson. We must possess the wisdom to read the seasons of history as clearly as we read the seasons of the orchard.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
οταν προβαλωϲιν ηδη βλεποντεϲ αυτ αφ εαυτων απ αυτων αφ εαυτων γεινω γεινωϲκετε οτι εγγυϲ εϲτιν η το θεροϲ

**English Translation**
When they shoot forth already, seeing [it] of yourselves [from them, of yourselves], you know that the summer is near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is a tangle of repetition—*αφ εαυτων απ αυτων αφ εαυτων*—yet this emphasizes the internal certainty. You do not need a tutor to tell you summer is coming when the leaves appear; "of yourselves" you possess this knowledge. The *θεροϲ* (summer) is the harvest, the end of the age. The Christian must possess a spiritual instinct that rivals natural instinct.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ και οταν ϊδη ταυτα γεινομε γεινωϲκετε ο εγγυϲ εϲτιν η βα του

**English Translation**
So also when you see these things happening, know that the Kingdom of [God] is near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The application of the botanical metaphor. The terrifying events (v. 25-26) are the "leaves" of the Kingdom. The text abbreviates the destination to *η βα του* (the Kingdom of the [God]). We must reframe catastrophe as the precursor to the *Basileia*.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν ο ου μη παρελθη η γενεα αυτη εωϲ παντα γενηται

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, that this generation shall by no means pass away until all things take place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The solemn *Amen*. The phrase *η γενεα αυτη* (this generation) anchors the prophecy. Whether this refers to the lineage of the faithful, the Jewish people, or the era of the Church until the end, the emphasis is on the certainty of the Lord's word. The double negative *ου μη* ensures that the generation will persist through the tribulation, not be extinguished by it.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
ο ου και η γη πα οι δε λογοι μου ου μη παρελευϲονται

**English Translation**
The heaven and the earth [shall pass away], but my words shall by no means pass away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A stark contrast between matter and truth. *ο ου* (The heaven) and the earth are transient; the scribe cuts the verb *πα* (shall pass away) short, as if the passing is swift. However, the *λογοι* (words) of Christ are indestructible. The physical universe is less real, less permanent, than the utterance of the Word of God.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
προϲεχετε εαυτοιϲ μηποτε βαρηθω ϋμων αι καρ εν κρεπαλη και μεθη και με βιωτικαιϲ και επιϲτη εφ υμαϲ εφνιδιοϲ η ημε εκεινη

**English Translation**
Take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down in carousing and drunkenness and cares of life, and that day come upon you sudden.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The pastoral danger is heaviness. *Βαρηθω* (weighed down) describes a heart made sluggish by fleshly indulgence (*κρεπαλη* and *μεθη*) and the anxieties of this life (*με* - *merimnais*). This heaviness prevents the "lifting up of the head" commanded earlier. The day comes *εφνιδιοϲ* (suddenly); the heavy heart will be too slow to rise to meet it.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ωϲ πα επιϲελευϲεται επελευϲεται γαρ επι πανταϲ τουϲ καθημενουϲ επι προϲωπον παϲηϲ τηϲ γηϲ

**English Translation**
As a [snare]; for it shall come upon all those sitting upon the face of all the earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads *ωϲ πα* (as a snare/trap). The judgment is a trap springing shut. It targets those *καθημενουϲ* (sitting)—those settled, comfortable, and sedentary in the world. The Christian is a pilgrim, standing and walking; the one "sitting" on the face of the earth is caught by the earth's judgment.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
αγρυπνει αγρυπνειται δε εν παντι και δεομενοι ϊνα κατϊϲχυϲητε εκ ταυτα παντα τα μελλοντα γεινε και ϲταθηναι εμπροϲθεν του του ανθρωπου

**English Translation**
Watch, be sleepless therefore at every season, praying that you may have strength to [escape] all these things that are about to happen, and to stand before the [Son] of Man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final charge is vigilance. *Αγρυπνειται* means to be sleepless, to be an ascetic watchman. The purpose of this prayerful insomnia is to *κατϊϲχυϲητε* (have strength/prevail) to escape the corruption and, ultimately, to *ϲταθηναι* (stand). While the wicked fall or sit, the righteous *stand* before the *του του ανθρωπου* (the [Son] of Man). To stand is to have boldness in the Day of Judgment.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ταϲ ημεραϲ τω ϊερω διδαϲκ ταϲ δε νυκταϲ εξερ ηϋλιζε ειϲ το οροϲ το κα ελαι ελαι

**English Translation**
And he was during the days in the temple teaching, but during the nights going out he lodged at the mount called [of] Olives [Olives].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the divine rhythm of the Incarnate Word, set forth for our imitation. By day, He is the Light of the World illuminating the Temple (`τω ϊερω`), fulfilling the office of the Teacher (`διδαϲκ`, abbreviated from *didascon*), pouring out doctrine upon the stone courts. Yet, when the shadows lengthen, He withdraws from the city of men to the creation of God. He does not sleep within those walls destined for destruction, but goes out (`εξερ`) to the Mount. The manuscript here presents a peculiar doubling, `ελαι ελαι` (Olives Olives), as if to emphasize the abundance of that place—the place of oil, of anointing, and soon, of the crushing press of the Passion. He lodges in the open air or simple shelter (`ηϋλιζε`), teaching us that while we must serve in the midst of the noise, our rest is found in the solitude of the mountain, in communion with the Father, separated from the tumult of the world.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και παϲ ο λαοϲ ωρ προϲ αυτον εν τω ϊερω ακουε ακουε αυτου

**English Translation**
And all the people rose early [to come] to him in the temple to hear [to hear] him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the hunger of the flock for the Shepherd. The text uses the contraction `ωρ` (likely *orthrizen*), indicating a rising at the very break of dawn. They do not wait for the heat of the day; they anticipate the sun to find the Sun of Justice.
