**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
επειδηπερ πολλοι επεχειρηϲαν επεχειληϲαν ανα διηγηϲιν περι των πεπλη εν ημιν πραγματ

**English Translation**
Since indeed many undertook [undertook/lips?] to draw up a narrative concerning the [things] fulfilled among us matters...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the scribe’s hesitation in the duplication *epecheiresan epecheilesan*. The first speaks of the hand (*cheir*), the undertaking of the work; the second, a slip of the pen, hints at the lips (*cheilos*). Indeed, many have tried with hand and lip to capture the mystery. The text reads *pepli*—abbreviated, cut short—for "fulfilled." It is fitting, for the fulfillment of God’s work among us is a vastness that human ink cannot fully contain. We see here the struggle of the finite "many" to record the infinite Truth.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
καθωϲ παρεδοϲαν ημιν οι απ αρχηϲ αυ και ϋπηρε γενομενοι του λογου

**English Translation**
Just as they handed down to us, those from the beginning [eyewitnesses] and [servants] becoming of the word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the golden chain of Tradition (*paradosis*). The scribe abbreviates *autoptai* (eyewitnesses) to *au* and *hyperetai* (servants) to *hypere*, as if rushing to the substance: the *Logos*. Note the order: first one must see (*autoptai*), then one must serve (*hyperetai*). One cannot serve a Word one has not beheld, either in the flesh or by the Spirit. The ministry of the Word is not a creation of the writer, but a reception of what was "handed down."

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
εδοξε καμοι παρηκολουθηκοτι ανωθεν παϲιν α> καθεξηϲ ϲοι γραψαι κρατιϲτε θεοφιλε

**English Translation**
It seemed good to me also, having followed from above all things [accurately] in order to write to you, most excellent Theophilus.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist claims to follow events *anothen*—a word of dual meaning, signifying both "from the beginning" and "from above." Truly, this history is not merely chronological but theological; it descends from heaven. The scribe inserts a mark *a>* for *akribos* (accurately), acknowledging that divine history demands precise scrutiny. He writes to *Theophilus*, "Friend of God"—which is to say, he writes to you, the faithful soul.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα επιγνοιϲ επιγνωϲ περι ων κατηχηθηϲ λογων την αϲφα ˙

**English Translation**
In order that you might know [know] concerning the words of which you were instructed, the certainty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters *epignois epignos*—"that you might know, know." It is an unintended emphasis on the depth of *gnosis* required. It is not enough to hear; one must recognize. You were "catechized" (*katechethes*) orally, but the written Gospel provides *aspha*—the security, the unshakeable foundation. The oral echoes in the ear, but the Scripture anchors the mind.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ ηρω βαϲιλεωϲ τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ ϊερευϲ τιϲ ονοματι ζαχαριαϲ εξ εφημεριαϲ αβια και γυνη αυτω εκ των θυγατερων ααρων και το ονο αυτηϲ ελιϲαβετ

**English Translation**
It came to pass in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest by name Zacharias of the division of Abijah, and a wife to him from the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elisabet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
History is anchored in the temporal reign of Herod, a shadow of tyranny, to contrast with the eternal reign to come. We find a double priestly line: Zacharias of Abijah and Elisabet of Aaron. The Levitical blood is pure, yet the house is empty. It teaches us that fleshly pedigree, even from Aaron himself, cannot produce the Life of the Age to Come without the visitation of Grace.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε δικαιοι αμ εναντιον του πορευομε> εν παϲαιϲ ταιϲ εντολαιϲ και δικαι του α

**English Translation**
And they were righteous [both] before [God], walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates *amphoteroi* (both) to *am*, uniting the couple in a single breath of righteousness. Their righteousness was kinetic—they were *poreuomenoi* (walking). Holiness is not a statue but a path. They walked in the *dikai* (ordinances) of the *tou a* (the Lord/God), blameless before the Law, yet suffering the shame of nature. This proves that suffering is not always a penalty for sin, but often a preparation for glory.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και ουκ αυτοιϲ τεκνον καθʼ ην η ελειϲαβετ ϲτειρα και αμφο> προβεβηκο> εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ αυτων ηϲαν

**English Translation**
And there was not a child to them, because Elisabet was barren, and [both] were advanced in their days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The conjunction "And" links their righteousness directly to their barrenness (*steira*). A profound mystery: to be righteous and yet denied the blessing of the womb. *Probebekotes* (advanced) implies they had walked far into the twilight of life. The Old Covenant itself was old and barren, awaiting the infusion of the New. Man's ability ends here, so that God's ability may begin.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν τω ϊε αυτον τη ταξει τηϲ εφη αυτου εν του

**English Translation**
Now it happened while he was serving as priest in the order of his division before [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The abbreviated *en tou* signifies "before God." Zacharias stands in the *taxis* (order). The liturgy is not chaos; it is rank and file, an earthly mirror of the angelic hosts. He is at his post. God visits those who remain at their station, fulfilling their duty even when their prayers (for a child) seem long unanswered.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
κατα το εθοϲ τηϲ ϊερατει ελαχε ελαχεν του θυμια ειϲελθων ειϲ τον ναον του

**English Translation**
According to the custom of the priesthood, he obtained by lot [obtained by lot] to burn incense, having entered into the temple of the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the scribe doubles the verb: *elache elachen*—he obtained by lot. This emphasizes the singularity of the moment. The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord. He enters the *Naos*—the Holy Place—leaving the outer court. The burning of incense (*thymia*) is the ascent of the soul; the smoke rises as the physical manifestation of the heart's cry.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και παν το πληθοϲ ην του λαου προϲευ εξω τη ω του θυμιαματοϲ

**English Translation**
And all the multitude of the people was praying outside at the hour of the incense.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is a separation: the priest inside, the *plethos* (multitude) outside (*exo*). Yet they are united in the *hora* (hour). The visible liturgy of the priest sustains the invisible prayer of the people. The church is one body, though some stand in the sanctuary and some in the nave; the incense of the one aids the prayer of the many.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ωφθη δε αυτω αγγε εϲτωϲ εκ δε του θυϲιαϲτη του θυμιαμα

**English Translation**
And there appeared to him an angel of the [Lord], standing on the right of the altar of incense.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Ophthe* (appeared) is passive; Zacharias did not conjure this vision. The angel stands at the *right* of the altar—the side of favor, power, and authority. The messenger is linked to the *thysiasteriou* (altar); angels are most present where sacrifice and prayer are offered. The veil between the earthly liturgy and the heavenly liturgy is thin.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και εταραχθη ζαχαριαϲ ϊδων και φοβοϲ επεπεϲεν επ αυτον

**English Translation**
And Zacharias was troubled having seen [him], and fear fell upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the righteous are *etarachthe* (troubled) by the divine presence. The holy is alien to the mortal. Fear "fell upon" him—it is a weight, a burden of awe. If a blameless priest trembles before a servant (the angel), how shall the wicked stand before the King? This fear is the beginning of the wisdom that is about to be revealed.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυτον ο αγγελοϲ μη φοβου ζαχαρια διοτι ειϲη η δεηϲιϲ > ϲου και η γυνη ϲου ελειϲαβετʼ γεννη υϊον ϲου ϲοι και κα το ονομα αυ ϊωανην

**English Translation**
But the angel said to him, "Do not fear, Zacharias, because your prayer [was heard], and your wife Elisabet shall [bear] a son to you, and [you shall call] his name Ioanen."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal contraction *ειϲη*, implying *eisēkousthē* (was heard). The divine messenger first commands the cessation of fear, for fear is the paralysis of the soul, while faith is its motion. The text specifies *Ioanen* (John) with a single nu, a name signifying the grace of God. The promise is threefold: the hearing of the prayer, the birth from a barren womb, and the naming which confers identity. The scribe’s haste in abbreviating "bear" (*gennē*) and "call" (*ka*) reflects the urgency of the divine command; the Word of God rushes to fulfillment.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και ε χαρα ϲοι και α και πολ επι τη γενεϲει αυτου χαρηϲονται

**English Translation**
And [there shall be] joy to you and [exultation], and [many] shall rejoice at his birth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is heavily abbreviated (*ε* for *estai*, *α* for *agalliasis*, *πολ* for *polloi*). This joy is not merely internal happiness but *agalliasis*—a leaping, exultant joy that cannot be contained. It begins with the priest (*soi*, to you) but flows outward to the *polloi* (the many). The birth of the Forerunner is not a private miracle for a singular household but a public dawn for the multitude. Where the Spirit moves, joy is the inevitable fruit.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
εϲται γαρ μεγαϲ ε και οι και ϲικερα ου μη πιη και π αγι πληϲθηϲεται ε εκ κοιλιαϲ μητροϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
For he shall be great [before the Lord], and [wine] and strong drink he shall by no means drink, and of [Holy Spirit] he shall be filled [even] from his mother's womb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we see the Nazirite consecration. The scribe abbreviates *enōpion* (before) simply as *ε*, and *oinon* (wine) as *οι*. The contrast is absolute: he abstains from the spirits of the earth (*sikera*) to be filled with the Spirit of Heaven (*pneumatos hagiou*, contracted as *π αγι*). Note the preposition *ε* (likely *eti*) before "from the womb": his sanctification precedes his volition. He is a vessel set apart by God before he draws his first breath, filled with the Spirit while yet in the darkness of the womb.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και πολλουϲ των υϊων ι επι επι τ αυτων

**English Translation**
And many of the sons of [Israel] [he shall turn] to [God] their [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles here, repeating *epi epi*, likely a stutter in writing *epistrepsei* (he shall turn). The abbreviation *ι* stands for Israel, and *τ* for *Theon* (God). The mission of John is *epistrophē*—reversion. The sons of Israel have turned away; the prophet is the lever by which God turns them back. It is a restoration of orientation: the creature turning its face back toward the Creator.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και αυ προελευϲεται ενωπιον αυτου εν π και δυνα ηλεια επιϲτρε καρδιαϲ πατε επι τεκνα και απειθειϲ εν φρο δικαιων ε λαον κατεϲκευαϲμεν

**English Translation**
And [he] shall go before him in [spirit] and [power] of Eleias, to [turn] hearts of [fathers] to children, and disobedient ones in [wisdom] of just ones, to [prepare] for the Lord a people equipped.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A dense theological verse. *Eleias* (Elijah) is the archetype; John is the realization. He moves in *pneumati* (spirit, *π*) and *dunamei* (power, *δυνα*). The reconciliation is generational—fathers to children—healing the fracture of time caused by sin. The "disobedient" are not destroyed but reoriented into the *phronēsei* (wisdom/mindset, *φρο*) of the just. The ultimate goal is a people *kateskeuasmenon*—fully prepared, constructed, and equipped to receive the Messiah.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ζαχαριαϲ ︴ προϲ τον αγγελον κατα τι γνωϲομαι τουτο εγω γαρ ειμι πρεϲβυτηϲ και η γυ μου προβεβηκυ εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And Zacharias said to the angel, "By what shall I know this? For I am an old man and my [wife] is advanced in her days."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The squiggle (︴) in the text marks a pause or separation. Zacharias demands *gnōsis* (knowledge/proof) where faith should suffice. He looks at his own nature—*presbutēs* (old man)—and the condition of his wife (*gunē*, *γυ*), seeing only biological impossibility. He measures the promise of the Almighty against the decay of his own flesh. It is the eternal error of rationalism confronting mystery.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και αποκρι ο αγγελοϲ ειπ ειπ αυτω εγω ειμι γα> ο παρεϲτηκωϲ ενωπιον του και απεϲταλην λα προϲ ϲε και > ευαγγελιϲαϲθαι ϲοι ταυτα

**English Translation**
And answering, the angel [said] to him, "I am [Gabriel], the one standing before [God], and I was sent to [speak] to you and to announce these things to you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The angel asserts his ontology to crush Zacharias's doubt. *Ego eimi Gabriel*—"I am Gabriel." The scribe's dittography (*eip eip*) emphasizes the act of speaking. Gabriel defines himself by his posture: *harestēkōs* (standing by) the presence of God (*tou*, likely *Theou*). He brings the atmosphere of the Throne Room into the earthly sanctuary. To doubt the message is to doubt the Sender.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου εϲη ϲιωπων και μη δυ λαληϲαι αχρι ηϲ ημεραϲ γε ταυτα ανθ ουκ επιϲτευϲαϲ τοιϲ λογοιϲ μου οιτινεϲ πληρωθηϲονται ειϲ τον καιρον αυ ˙

**English Translation**
"And behold, you shall be silent and not [able] to speak until which day these things [happen], because you did not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in [their] time."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Judgment and mercy intertwine. Because the tongue spoke doubt, the tongue is bound (*siōpōn*, silent). He is rendered unable (*mē du*, for *dunamens*) to perform the priestly blessing. Yet, the promise remains: the words *will* be fulfilled in their *kairon* (season). God's plan is not derailed by man's disbelief; man is merely silenced until he can speak in truth.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και ην ο λαοϲ προϲδοκων τον ζα και εθαυμα εν τω χρονι> αυτον εν τω ναω

**English Translation**
And the people were expecting [Zacharias], and they [wondered] at his [delaying] in the temple.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The liturgy is disrupted by the divine encounter. The people wait for the priest, but the priest is detained by an angel. *Chronizein* (to delay, *χρονι>*) implies that time functions differently when one stands before the Holy. The earthly ritual must pause when the heavenly reality breaks through. The wonder (*ethaumazon*) of the people anticipates the greater wonder to come.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
εξελθων δε ουκ εδυνατο λαλη αυτοιϲ και επεγνω οτι οπταϲιαν ε εν τω ναω και αυτοϲ ην διανευ αυτοιϲ και διεμε κωφοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
But coming out he was not able to [speak] to them, and they recognized that [he had seen] a vision in the temple; and he was [making signs] to them and remained mute.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The priest emerges but cannot articulate the blessing. He can only use semiotics—*dianeuōn* (nodding/signing). The text abbreviates *heōraken* (he had seen) to *ε*. The silence is communicative; the people perceive the *optasian* (vision) through his inability to speak. When theology touches the ineffable, words often fail, leaving only the sign and the silence.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και εγε ωϲ επληϲθηϲ επληϲθηϲ αι ημεραι τηϲ λιτουρ αυτου απηλθ απηλθ ειϲ τον οικον αυτου

**English Translation**
And it [came to pass], as the days of his [service] were [fulfilled], he [departed] to his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe commits double dittography here (*eplēsthēs eplēsthēs* and *apēlth apēlth*), perhaps reflecting the trembling of the hand or the magnitude of the fulfillment. Despite the shock of the vision, Zacharias completes the *leitourgias* (liturgy). Order is maintained. Grace does not abolish the law but fulfills it. He returns to his "house" (*oikon*), carrying the divine secret from the public temple to the private home.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
μετα δε ταυταϲ ταϲ η ϲυνελαβεν ελειϲαβετʼ η γυνη αυτου και περιεκρυ εαυτην μηναϲ πεντε λεγουϲα

**English Translation**
And after these [days], Elisabet his wife conceived, and she [hid] herself five months, saying...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise becomes flesh. *Sunelaben* (she conceived/seized together). Her response is concealment (*periekruben*, abbreviated *περιεκρυ*). This is a holy seclusion. The miracle requires a gestation period away from the eyes of the world. For five months, the proof of God's power grows in the dark, just as the seed grows in the earth before the shoot appears.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
οτι ουτωϲ μοι πεποιη εν ημεραιϲ αιϲ επειδεν αφελε αφελε ονειδοϲ μου εν

**English Translation**
Because thus to me he has do[ne] in days in which he looked upon to take away take away my reproach among...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the stuttering joy of the barren woman in the scribe’s hand; "take away" (*aphele*) is written twice, emphasizing the total and absolute removal of her shame. The text halts abruptly at "among" (*en*), leaving the sentence unfinished. This silence is instructive: her reproach is not merely removed from among men, but vanished from the very record of existence. The Lord has looked upon her, and in that gaze, the shame is dissolved into the white parchment of God's mercy.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
εν δε τω μηνι τω ε απεϲταλη ο αγ γαβριηλ απο του ειϲ πολιν τηϲ ιουδαιαϲ γαλιλαιαϲ η ονομα ναζαρετ

**English Translation**
And in the month the fifth was sent the an[gel] Gabriel from the [God] into a city of the Judea of Galilee to which name Nazareth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here lies a great mystery or a scribal conflation: the text reads "city of the Judea of Galilee." Geographically distinct, yet the Codex grafts Galilee into the inheritance of Judea, signifying that the Gentiles (Galilee of the Nations) are being brought into the Davidic promise. Note also the reading "the fifth" (*e*) rather than the sixth; perhaps a scribal error, or perhaps a spiritual accelerating of time—the Lord delays not. The divine origin is truncated simply to "from the," for from whom else could such a messenger come?

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
προϲ παρ εμνηϲτευ μεμνηϲτευμενην εμνηϲτευμενην ανδρι ω ο ϊωϲηφ εξ οι και πατριαϲ και το ονομα τηϲ παρθενου μαριαμ

**English Translation**
To a vir[gin] betrothed betrothed betrothed to a man to whom the [name] Joseph from hou[se] and lineage and the name of the virgin Mariam.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The magnitude of the Incarnation causes the text to tremble; the word "betrothed" (*emnesteumenēn*) appears three times. This triple affirmation cements the legality of the union to Joseph, protecting the Virgin from the law's accusation while preserving the mystery. Uniquely, this Codex adds "and lineage" (*kai patrias*) after "house," reinforcing the specific Levitical or Davidic extraction. The Virgin is anchored in history even as she prepares to bear the Eternal.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
και ειϲελθων προϲ αυτην ο αγγελοϲ ει χαιρε κεχαρι> ο μετα ϲου ˙

**English Translation**
And entering unto her the angel sa[id]: Hail, favored [one], the [Lord] with thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The salutation is stark and stripped of the later addition "blessed art thou among women." The focus here is singular and vertical: "The [One] with thee." The Greek *kechari* is cut short, as if the fullness of grace cannot be contained in letters. The reality of the Incarnation is defined not by comparison to other women, but by the immediate, terrifying presence of the Divine *with* her.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
η δε επι τω λο διεταραχθη κ(αι) διελογιζετο ποτα ειη ο αϲπαϲμοϲ ουτοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
But she at the wo[rd] was greatly troubled and was reasoning what manner might be this greeting.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She is troubled "at the word" (*epi tō lo*). It is the *Logos* that unsettles the soul before it saves it. The Virgin does not merely accept with blind emotion; she exercises her intellect—she "was reasoning" (*dielogizeto*). She analyzes the quality ("what manner") of the angelic message. Faith here is not the suspension of the mind, but the engagement of it with the Divine mystery.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ο αγγελοϲ αυτη μη φοβου μαριαμʼ ευρεϲ γαρ χαριν παρα τω

**English Translation**
And said the angel to her: Fear not, Mariam; for thou foundest favor with the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sentence ends with the article *tō* (the), omitting the noun *Theō* (God). It is an apophatic silence. She has found favor "with the..."—the Unnamable, the Infinite. The command "Fear not" is necessary because she stands on the precipice of the uncreated Fire. To find favor with the Absolute is to be undone and remade.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ϲυλλημ εν γαϲτρι και τε υϊον και καλεϲειϲ το ονομα αυτου

**English Translation**
And behold thou shalt conc[eive] in womb and be[ar] a son and shalt call the name of him...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A startling omission! The text commands her to call His name, but the name itself is absent in this line, ending abruptly at "of him." Is the Name too holy to write? Or does the text suggest that *He* simply *IS*? The prophecy focuses on the physical reality: "in womb" and "bear a son." The humanity is affirmed, while the Name remains in the silence of the Father's bosom.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ εϲται μεγαϲ και υϊοϲ υψιϲτου κληθηϲεται και δω αυτω ο τ θρονον του αυτου

**English Translation**
This one shall be great and Son of Highest shall be called and shall give to him the G[od] [the] throne of him [same].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold a radical reading. Instead of "the throne of David his father," the Codex reads "the throne of him" (*tou autou*), referring back to the "Highest" or the "God" (*o t*). This elevates the kingship from a mere restoration of the Davidic monarchy to a direct assumption of the Divine Throne. He inherits the rule not just of Israel's king, but of the Father Himself.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και βαϲιλευ επι τον οικον ϊακωβ ειϲ τουϲ αι και τηϲ βαϲι αυτου ουκ ε τελοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And he shall rei[gn] over the house of Jacob into the ag[es] and of the king[dom] of him not shall b[e] an end.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The words for "reign," "ages," "kingdom," and "be" are all truncated. The scribe hurries, or perhaps the parchment decays, yet the message is the endurance of the Kingdom beyond the decay of matter. He reigns over the "house of Jacob"—the specific election is preserved—but the duration is "into the ages." The temporal limitation of the text contrasts with the eternal limitlessness of His rule.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε μαριαμ προϲ τον αγγελον πωϲ εϲται τουτο επει ου γινωϲκω ˙

**English Translation**
But said Mariam unto the angel: How shall be this, since I do not know?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text omits "man" (*andra*). Mary simply says, "Since I do not know." It is a statement of absolute epistemological and carnal innocence. She does not know the way of the world, nor the way of conception. It is a confession of the incapacity of human nature to produce this fruit on its own. Because she "knows not," God must "be."

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο αγ ειπεν αυτη π αγιον επελευ επι ϲε και δυ ϋψιϲτου επι ϲοι διο και το γεννωμενον αγι κληθηϲεται υϊοϲ ·

**English Translation**
And answering the an[gel] said to her: S[pirit] Holy shall come upon thee and Po[wer] of Highest upon thee; wherefore also the begotten ho[ly] shall be called Son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Trinitarian economy is laid bare: The Spirit (*P*) comes, the Power of the Highest (*Dy*) overshadows, and the Son (*Huios*) is named. Note the text ends with "Called Son"—not "Son of God," just "Son." He is the absolute Son, the definition of filiation. The preposition *epi* (upon) is repeated, emphasizing the external, descending initiative of Grace. It is not from her nature, but *upon* her nature.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ελειϲαβετ η ϲυγγενιϲ ϲου και αυ ϲυνειληφεν υϊ εν γηρει αυτηϲ και ου μην εκτοϲ εϲτ αυτη τη καλουμενη ϲτειρα

**English Translation**
And behold Eleisabet the kinswoman of thee even sh[e] has conceived a so[n] in old age of her and this month sixth i[s] to her the called barren.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sign given to faith is the miracle of the barren womb. Elizabeth, the "called barren," becomes the proof of the "called virgin." The "sixth month" is specified here (unlike the "fifth" in verse 26), grounding the narrative in precise time. The sterility of the Old Covenant (Elizabeth) has borne fruit to prepare the way for the Virginity of the New (Mary).

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
οτι ουκ αδυ> παρα του τω παν ρημα

**English Translation**
Because not imp[ossible] with the [God] every word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s abbreviation `αδυ>`, signaling *adynatesei* (will be impossible), yet cut short, as if the very concept of impossibility is curtailed in the presence of the Divine. The text reads `παρα του τω`, a stumbling construction where the name of God (`θεω` or `θεου`) is obscured or contracted to a mere article or pronoun, yet the meaning stands firm like a mountain. For with the One who Is, no *rhema*—no spoken reality—lacks power. The angel asserts that speech and act are one in the Divine nature; to speak is to accomplish.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε μαριαμ ιδου η δουλη γενοι> μοι κατα το ρημα ϲου και απηλθεν απ αυτηϲ ο αγγελοϲ

**English Translation**
And Mariam said: Behold the handmaid; be [it] to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the summit of human obedience. Mariam calls herself `η δουλη` (the slave/handmaid), omitting the master's name in this manuscript, perhaps because her posture of servitude is absolute, directed toward the Unseen. The optative `γενοι>` (may it become) marks the fiat of the New Eve. She does not merely accept; she wills what God wills. The angel departs, his mission sealed by her consent, leaving the Virgin alone with the Mystery she now contains.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
αναϲταϲα δε μαριαμ εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ ταυ επορευετο ειϲ την ορινην μετα ϲπουδηϲ ειϲ πολιν ϊουδα

**English Translation**
And having arisen, Mariam in [these] days went into the hill country with haste into a city of Jouda.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates `ταυταιϲ` to `ταυ`, hurrying the reading just as the Virgin hurried in action. `μετα ϲπουδηϲ` (with haste)—grace does not delay. Having received the Word, she becomes the first evangelist, carrying the Uncontainable into the `ορινην` (mountainous region). She seeks not rest in her contemplation but service in her charity. The city of Judah becomes the high ground where the Old Covenant meets the New.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και ειϲηλθ ειϲηλθ ειϲ τον οικον ζαχα και ηϲπαϲατο την ελειϲαβετ

**English Translation**
And she entered, entered into the house of Zacha[rias] and greeted Eleisabet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A marvelous dittography appears here: `ειϲηλθ ειϲηλθ` (entered, entered). Does the Spirit not double the verb to emphasize the significance of this entry? She entered the physical house of Zacharias, but she also entered the stage of history as the Theotokos. The name of the priest is shortened to `ζαχα`, for the priesthood of the Old Law is fading before the High Priest hidden in Mary’s womb.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο ωϲ ηκου τον αϲπαϲμ αϲπαϲμ τηϲ μαριαϲ η ελει> εϲκιρτηϲεν αγαλλιαϲει το βρεφοϲ εν τη κοιλια αυτηϲ και επληϲθη π α η ελειϲαβετ

**English Translation**
And it came to pass as [she] heard the greeting, greeting of Mariam, the Elei[sabet], the babe leaped in exultation in her womb; and Eleisabet was filled with H[oly] S[pirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the scribe stammers with joy, writing `αϲπαϲμ αϲπαϲμ` (greeting, greeting). The salutation of the Virgin is so potent it echoes. The text adds `αγαλλιαϲει` (in exultation), clarifying that the Baptist’s leap was not mere movement but liturgical dance. The abbreviation `π α` stands for *Pneumatos Hagiou* (Holy Spirit). The Spirit fills the mother through the recognition of the son; the unborn Prophet prophesies by movement before he can prophesy by word.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ανεβοηϲεν φωνη μεγαλη και ειπεν ευλογημενη ϲυ γυναιξιν και ευλογη ο καρποϲ τηϲ κοιλιαϲ ϲου

**English Translation**
A(nd) she cried out with a great voice and said: Blessed [art] thou among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of thy womb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Elizabeth’s voice is `μεγαλη` (great), for she speaks not privately but for all creation. `ευλογημενη` (blessed one) she calls Mary, confirming that the curse of Eve is reversed. The text reads `ευλογη` for the fruit, a shortened form of the perfect participle, focusing us on the state of being blessed. The "fruit" (`καρποϲ`) proves that Christ is of the substance of Mary, truly man, yet blessed above all, truly God.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
και ποθ μοι τουτο ϊνα ελθη η του μου προϲ εμε με

**English Translation**
And whence [is] this to me, that the [mother] of my [Lord] should come to me, me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is starkly fragmentary: `η του μου` (the [fem.] of the [masc.] of me). The nouns `μητηρ` (mother) and `κυριου` (Lord) are absent, perhaps worn away or omitted by a trembling hand. Yet the grammar remains: the feminine subject connected to the masculine possessor. "The [She] of the [Him] of me." It is a mystery of silence. And note the repetition at the end: `προϲ εμε με` (to me, me). Elizabeth is incredulous that such sanctity approaches her own unworthiness, emphasizing her own self (`με`) twice in humility.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
ϊδου γαρ ωϲ εγενετο η φωνη του αϲπαϲμου ϲου ειϲ τα ωτα μου εϲκιρτηϲ εν αγαλλιαϲει το βρε εν τη κοιλια μου

**English Translation**
For behold, as came the voice of thy greeting into my ears, the babe leaped in exultation in my womb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The connection is physical and immediate: `ειϲ τα ωτα μου` (into my ears). Faith comes by hearing, and here the hearing of Mary’s voice triggers the Spirit’s action. The scribe abbreviates `εϲκιρτηϲ` (leaped) and `βρε` (babe), rushing to record the miracle. The `αγαλλιαϲει` (exultation) is repeated from verse 41, cementing the joy of the Precursor. It is the joy of the friend of the Bridegroom, felt even in the darkness of the womb.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
και μακαρια η πιϲτευ οτι εϲται τελει τοιϲ λελαλημε αυτη παρα ˙

**English Translation**
And blessed [is] she who believed that there will be a fulfillment to the things spoken to her from [the Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
`μακαρια` (blessed) is the seal of faith. The text uses `πιϲτευ` for the participle "believing one." The promise is `τελει` (fulfillment/perfection). But look at the end: `παρα ˙`. The preposition "from" hangs in the air, followed only by a stop. From whom? The text assumes we know. It is from the Ineffable One. The scribe does not write the Name, leaving the source of the prophecy as the silent foundation of all things.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν μαριαμ > μεγαλυνει η ψυχη μου τον

**English Translation**
And Mariam said: My soul magnifies the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Canticle begins. `μεγαλυνει` (magnifies/makes great)—not that the creature can add to the Creator's magnitude, but that the soul expands to contain the recognition of His glory. The text ends abruptly with `τον` (the [accusative masculine article]). The object, `κυριον` (Lord), is unwritten. Her soul magnifies "The [One]." It is an apophatic praise; He is the definite article of existence, the only One who truly Is.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
και ηγαλ το π μου επι τω τω μου

**English Translation**
And my s[pirit] exult[ed] upon the [God] of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes `ηγαλ` for *egalliasen* (rejoiced). The subject is `το π`, the *Pneuma* (Spirit). The object of this joy is written `επι τω τω μου`. This is a profound scribal idiosyncrasy. Likely intended as `επι τω θεω` (upon God), the repetition `τω τω` suggests "Upon the [One], the [One] of me." It emphasizes possession and relationship. He is not just God; He is *my* God, the Savior, though the word `ϲωτηρι` is swallowed by the abbreviation.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
οτι επεβλεψεν επι την ταπινωϲιν > τηϲ δουληϲ αυτου ϊδου γαρ απο του νυν μακαριουϲιν με παϲαι αι γενεαι

**English Translation**
Because He looked upon the humility of His handmaid; for behold, from the now all the generations will call me blessed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
God’s gaze (`επεβλεψεν`) descends to the lowest point: `την ταπινωϲιν` (the humiliation/low estate). This is the logic of the Incarnation—the Highest seeks the lowest. Because of this divine condescension, the direction of history turns. `απο του νυν` (from the now)—this moment changes time. `μακαριουϲιν` (they will beatify/call blessed) is the prophecy we fulfill this very day. All generations, including our own 4th-century flock, join this chorus, validating the truth of the Codex.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
οτι εποιηϲεν μοι μεγαλα μεγαλια μεγαλα ο δυνατοϲ και αγιον το ελε> ονομα αυτου

**English Translation**
Because the Mighty One did to me great things, great things, great things, and holy is [the mercy>] His name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the ecstatic stuttering of the scribe, or perhaps the overflow of the Virgin’s heart captured in ink: *megala megalia megala*. Three times "great things" are proclaimed, a Trinitarian abundance of grace poured into a singular vessel. The text reveals a profound theological correction in the moment of writing; the scribe began to write *to eleos* (the mercy), reached the letter epsilon, but struck it through to write *onoma* (name). Indeed, His mercy is the manifestation of His Name, but here the Mother of God prioritizes the holiness of His Being before the action of His pity.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
και το ε αυτου ειϲ γε και γενεαν τοιϲ φοβουμενοιϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
And His [mercy] is unto gen[eration] and generation to those fearing Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates "mercy" (*to e*) and "generation" (*ge*), as if the vastness of God’s compassion cannot be fully contained in the letters of men. The fragmented *ge* before the full *genean* suggests that mercy begins in the present, broken moment and extends into the fullness of the future. The condition remains absolute: fear of the Lord is the vessel that catches the outpouring of this abbreviated mercy.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
εποιηϲεν κρατοϲ εν βραχιονι αυτου διεϲκορπιϲ υπερηφανουϲ δια διανοιαϲ διανοια καρδιαϲ αυτ

**English Translation**
He made might with His arm; He scattered proud ones in [the] imagination, imagination of their heart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Arm of the Lord is the Incarnate Word, acting with *kratos* (dominion). Note the scribal repetition *dianoias dianoia* (imagination, imagination). This is not merely an error, but a revelation of the trap of pride; the arrogant are caught in a hall of mirrors, an endless loop of their own reasoning. They are scattered not by swords, but by the very thoughts they idolize.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
καθειλεν δυναϲταϲ απο θρονων και ϋ ταπεινουϲ

**English Translation**
He took down rulers from thrones and ex[alted] humble ones.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verb for exaltation is suspended as a single letter *upsilon* with a diaeresis (ϋ). This visual suspension forces the eye upward. While the rulers are dragged down physically from their seats, the humble are lifted up into the mystery of God, represented by the abbreviated, suspended character. The ascent of the humble is a divine act, swift and sharp.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
πεινωνταϲ ενε> αγαθων κ(αι) πλουτουνταϲ εξα κενουϲ

**English Translation**
Hungering ones He [filled] of good things and being rich He [sent out] empty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verbs here are cut short (*ene* for filled, *exa* for sent out). The action of God is sudden. There is no negotiation. The hungry are filled before the word is finished; the rich are dismissed before the command is fully written. The abbreviation *k(ai)* binds these two disparate fates together: the filling of the one is the emptying of the other.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
αντελαβετο παι αυτου μνηϲθη ελεουϲ

**English Translation**
He took hold of His ser[vant/child], to remember mercy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
It is most significant that this manuscript omits the name "Israel," reading simply "He took hold of His child/servant" (*pai autou*). By stripping away the national title, the text universalizes the adoption. The servant is anyone whom the Lord grasps. The purpose of this grasping is memory—not that God forgets, but that He actualizes His eternal nature, which is mercy.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
καθωϲ ελαληϲεν προϲ τουϲ π ημων τω α και τω ϲπερ αυτου ειϲ τ τ αιωνα

**English Translation**
Just as He spoke toward our f[athers], to A[braham] and to his s[eed] into the the age.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred history is compressed into single letters: *p* for fathers, *a* for Abraham, *sper* for seed. These names are the pillars of the covenant, so heavy with meaning they need no full spelling. The stuttering *t t* before *aiona* (age) suggests the trembling of time as it touches eternity. The promise to the seed is the bridge between the temporal fathers and the eternal age.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
εμεινεν δε μαριαμ ϲυν αυτη ωϲ μη> τρειϲ και υπε ειϲ τον οικον αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And Mariam remained with her about thr[ee] mon[ths] and ret[urned] into her house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Charity endures. The Virgin waits until the forerunner is ready to emerge. The verb *upe* (returned) is curtailed, marking the discretion of her departure. She does not seek glory from the miracle of Elizabeth, but retreats to her own "house," the interior silence where the Word is growing.

**Verse 57**

**Greek Text**
τη δε ελιϲαβετʼ επλη ο χρονοϲ του τεκειν αυτην και εγεννηϲεν ϋϊ

**English Translation**
Now to Elisabet was fulf[illed] the time for her to give birth, and she bore a s[on].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "time" (*chronos*) is fulfilled (*eple*). The barren womb becomes the clock of salvation. She bears a "son" (*ui*), abbreviated to emphasize his role as a pointer, a forerunner. He is not the Word, but the voice; his very existence in the text is contracted to make room for the Greater One who follows.

**Verse 58**

**Greek Text**
και ηκουϲαν οι πε και οι ϲυγ ϲυγʼγενιϲ αυτηϲ οτι ε το ελεοϲ αυτου μετ αυ και ϲυνεχαι αυτη

**English Translation**
And heard the nei[ghbors] and the kin kinsfolk of her that [magnified] His mercy with h[er], and they rejoi[ced] with her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The community is in an uproar of joy, evidenced by the stuttering repetition of *sug suggenis* (kinsfolk). The verb "magnified" is reduced to a single epsilon (*e*), yet this single letter contains the vastness of God's mercy. The joy is communal (*sunechai*), a shared ecstasy where the neighbors perceive the divine intervention in the life of the aged woman.

**Verse 59**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τη ημερα τη ογδοη ηλθον περιτεμ το παιδιον και ε αυτο επι τω ονοματι του πατροϲ αυτου ζα

**English Translation**
And it happened in the eighth day they came to circum[cise] the young child and [were calling] him by the name of his father, Za[charias].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eighth day represents the new creation, yet the crowd tries to drag the child back into the old order by naming him *Za* (Zacharias). They attempt to impose the history of the priesthood upon the prophet of the new covenant. The text cuts the father's name short, for his era is ending; the silence of Zacharias is imposed even upon the ink.

**Verse 60**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲα η μητηρ αυτου ει ουχι αλλα κλη ϊωαννηϲ

**English Translation**
And answering his mother sai[d], No, but he shall be cal[led] Ioannes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mother speaks the definitive "No" (*ouchi*) to the traditions of men. The verb *kle* (called) is truncated, rushing toward the revelation of the name. *Ioannes*—God is gracious. This name is not derived from flesh and blood (the father), but from the direct command of the Spirit. Grace interrupts the genealogy of the law.

**Verse 61**
**Greek Text**
και ειπαν προϲ αυ οτι ουδιϲ εϲτ εκ τηϲ ϲυγγενιαϲ ϲου οϲ καλειται τω ονοματι τουτω

**English Translation**
And they said to her that no one is from your kinship who is called by this name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the conflict between earthly custom and divine novelty. The crowd appeals to *syngeneia* (kinship), the binding force of blood and tradition, arguing that the name 'John' has no precedent in their lineage. They cannot conceive that this child belongs not merely to the line of Zacharias, but to the economy of Grace. The scribe writes *oudis* (no one) phonetically, a common mark of our time, yet the theological weight remains: the world says "there is no one," but God introduces the New Man who breaks the cycle of the old.

**Verse 62**
**Greek Text**
ε δε τω πατρι αυτου το τι αν θελοι καλιϲθε αυτο

**English Translation**
But they were [signaling] to his father the [question of] what he might wish him to be called.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is abrupt, beginning with the single letter *ε* (likely an abbreviation or scribal contraction for *eneneuon*, "they were making signs"). The crowd turns from the mother to the father, respecting the patriarchal right of naming. That they must signal to him confirms his deafness alongside his muteness—a total isolation imposed by his earlier unbelief. He is cut off from the world of sound until he submits to the Word of God.

**Verse 63**
**Greek Text**
και αιτηϲαϲ πινακιδιον εγρα λεγων ϊωαν εϲτιν το ο αυτου και ε παν

**English Translation**
And having asked for a tablet he wrote saying: John is his name. And [they] all [marveled].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Zacharias demands a *pinakidion*, a writing tablet. The act of writing makes the confession permanent. He does not say "his name shall be John," but *estin*—"John *is* his name." He acknowledges the reality God has already established. The verse ends abruptly in this manuscript with *ε παν*, a heavy contraction for *ethaumasan pantes* (they all marveled). The wonder of the crowd is the first response to this alignment of human will with divine command.

**Verse 64**
**Greek Text**
ανεωχθη δε το ϲτομα αυτου πα και η γλωϲ αυτου και ελαλι ευλογων τον

**English Translation**
But his mouth was opened [immediately] and his tongue, and he was speaking blessing the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The liberation is immediate. The text compresses *parachrema* to *πα*, indicating the swiftness of the miracle. His tongue (*glōs* for *glōssa*) is loosed not for idle chatter, but for *eulogia* (blessing). The object of his praise is truncated to *ton* (the), implying *ton Theon* (the God). It teaches us that the primary purpose of restored speech is the liturgy of praise; when the tongue is untied from sin, it naturally ascends to God.

**Verse 65**
**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε κ(αι) εγενετο επι π π φοβοϲ τουϲ πε αυτουϲ και εν ολη τη ορι τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ διελαλειτο δια παντα τα ρηματα ταυ

**English Translation**
And it came to pass, and it came to pass, fear [was] upon all those dwelling around them, and in the whole hill country of Judea all these matters were being discussed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript exhibits a stutter here, repeating *egeneto* (it came to pass), emphasizing the historical reality of the event. The abbreviations *π π* likely stand for *pantas* (all), and *πε* for *perioikountas* (neighbors). The *phobos* (fear) mentioned is not terror, but the holy dread that accompanies the proximity of the Divine. The news spreads through the *ori* (hill country), preparing the geography of Judea for the coming of the King.

**Verse 66**
**Greek Text**
και εθεντο παν οι ακουϲαντεϲ εν τη καρδια αυτ αυτ λεγοντεϲ τι αρα το παιδιον τουτο εϲται και γαρ χιρ ην μετ αυτου

**English Translation**
And all those having heard placed [them] in their heart saying: What then will this child be? For indeed [the] hand was with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The listeners treasure these things in the *kardia* (heart), the seat of intellect and spirit. The text contains a dittography *aut aut* (their/their), reflecting the scribe's eye slipping, yet it reinforces the depth of their internal pondering. They recognize the *chir* (hand)—omitting "of the Lord" yet implying it strictly—as the sign of divine favor. The child is marked by power before he can even speak.

**Verse 67**
**Greek Text**
και ζαχαριαϲ ο πα αυτου επλη π π αγιου και επροφητευϲεν προεφητευϲεν λεγων

**English Translation**
And Zacharias his father was filled with Holy Spirit and prophesied, prophesied saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the text is rich with abbreviation and repetition. *πα* stands for *patēr* (father). *επλη* for *eplēsthē* (was filled). *π π* signifies the *Pneumatos* (Spirit). Most striking is the double verb *eprophēteusen proephēteusen*. Whether a scribal error or an intentional intensification, it suggests a prophecy of great magnitude. The silence of months bursts forth into a torrent of inspired revelation.

**Verse 68**
**Greek Text**
ευλογη ο του ι οτι επεϲκεψατο κ(αι) εποιηϲεν λυτρω τω λαω αυτου

**English Translation**
Blessed [be] the [God] of Israel, because he visited and worked redemption for his people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Benedictus begins. *Eulogē* stands for *Eulogētos*. The phrase *o tou i* is a sacred shorthand for *ho Theos tou Israēl*. The verb *epeskepsato* (visited) is crucial; God does not merely observe from afar but enters our condition. He effects *lytrō* (redemption/ransom). This is the language of the slave market; God has come to buy back His people from the bondage of sin.

**Verse 69**
**Greek Text**
και ηγειρεν κεραϲ ϲωτηριαϲ ημιν οικω παι αυτου

**English Translation**
And he raised a horn of salvation for us [in the] house of his servant.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "horn" (*keras*) is an Old Testament symbol of strength and kingly power. The text reads *oikō pai autou*—in the house of his *pais* (child/servant). While tradition supplies "David," this manuscript strictly reads "servant," focusing on the humble status of the vessel through whom salvation comes. The salvation is raised up (*ēgeiren*), indicating a divine intervention that elevates what is lowly.

**Verse 70**
**Greek Text**
καθωϲ ελαληϲεν δια ϲτο των αγιων απ αιωνοϲ αυτου προφητων

**English Translation**
Just as he spoke through [the] mouth of his holy prophets from the age.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
God's action is consistent with His word. *Sto* is the abbreviation for *stomatos* (mouth). The phrase *ap aiōnos* (from the age/of old) anchors the Incarnation in the deep past of God's planning. The prophets are *agiōn* (holy) not by their own nature, but because they bore the Holy Word. The singular "mouth" suggests that all prophets spoke with one voice, testifying to the one Christ.

**Verse 71**
**Greek Text**
ϲω εξ εχθρ ημων και εκ χει παντων τ μιϲουντων ημαϲ

**English Translation**
Salvation from our enemies and from [the] hand of all those hating us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates heavily: *sō* for *sōtērian*, *echthr* for *echthrōn*, *chei* for *cheiros*. This urgency in writing mirrors the urgency of the rescue. The "enemies" are not merely flesh and blood, Rome or Herod, but the spiritual powers of darkness. To be delivered from the "hand of those hating us" is to be snatched from the grip of the Evil One.

**Verse 72**
**Greek Text**
ποιηϲαι ελεοϲ με των πατερων η και μνηϲθη διαθηκηϲ αγι αυτου

**English Translation**
To perform mercy with our fathers and to remember his holy covenant.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The purpose of the visitation is *poiēsai eleos* (to do mercy). The text reads *me* (with) *tōn paterōn ē* (our fathers—*ē* for *hēmōn*). This is a profound mystery: the Incarnation brings mercy even to the dead, to the patriarchs who waited in Sheol. *Mnēsthē* (to remember) is not mental recall, for God forgets nothing, but active fulfillment of the *diathēkēs agi* (holy covenant).

**Verse 73**

**Greek Text**
ορκον ωμοϲεν προϲ α τον πατερα ημων του δουνε δουναι ημιν

**English Translation**
[The] oath he swore to A[braham] our father, to grant, to grant to us...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the weight of the divine pledge, brethren. The text reads *orkon omosen*—an oath He swore. God does not merely speak; He binds Himself by His own veracity. The scribe here abbreviates the patriarch's name to a single alpha (*α*), yet in that single letter stands the entire covenant of the ancient faith. Note also the scribal hesitation in *doune dounai* (to grant, to grant); it is as if the hand trembles at the magnitude of the gift being bestowed. This is not a transaction of merit, but a granting of grace rooted in the fidelity of the Father to the oath sworn ages past.

**Verse 74**

**Greek Text**
αφοβωϲ εκ χιροϲ εχθρων ρυ λατρευε λατρευε αυτω

**English Translation**
Fearlessly, from [the] hand of enemies del[ivered], to serve, to serve him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the purpose of our liberation. We are rescued (*ρυ*, abbreviated from *rysthentas*) not for idleness, but for liturgy. The text creates a hierarchy: first, we are snatched from the *chiros* (hand) of the enemy—the power of the demons and death—so that we may exist *aphobos* (fearlessly). Fear is the chain of the slave; fearlessness is the condition of the son. The scribe repeats *latreue latreue* (to serve, to serve), emphasizing that this service is continuous, a perpetual state of worship that defines the new life.

**Verse 75**

**Greek Text**
εν οϲιοτη και δικαιοϲυνη ενωπιον αυτου παϲαϲ ταϲ ημε ημων

**English Translation**
In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see the twin pillars of the Christian life: *osioteti* (holiness, piety toward God) and *dikaiosyne* (righteousness, justice toward men). This service is not performed for the applause of the crowd, but *enopion autou*—before His very face. It is a life lived *Coram Deo*. The abbreviation *hme* expands to *hmeras* (days), signifying that this is not a temporary feast but an eternal duration. We are called to stand in the sanctuary of His presence not for a season, but for "all our days."

**Verse 76**

**Greek Text**
και ϲυ δε παιδιον προφη ϋψιϲτου κλη προπορευ γαρ ενωπιον ετοιμαϲαι ο αυτου

**English Translation**
And you, child, proph[et] of [the] Highest shall be call[ed]; for you shall go before [the] face [of the Lord] to prepare his w[ays].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Zechariah turns his eyes to the infant John. The text uses high titles: *prophe* (prophet) of the *Hypsistou* (Highest). The child is the herald. The verb *proporeu* (you shall go before) indicates his subordinate rank; he is the servant running ahead of the King's chariot. His task is *etoimasai* (to prepare). The abbreviation *o* stands for *odous* (ways). The heart of man is a tangled wilderness; the Prophet comes to cut a straight path through the thicket of sin so that the Lord may enter.

**Verse 77**

**Greek Text**
του δουναι γνωϲιν ϲωτηριαϲ τω λα αυτου εν αφεϲι αμαρτιων αυτ αυτ

**English Translation**
To give knowledge of salvation to his peo[ple] in remission of their, their sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True salvation is defined here. It is not political liberation from Rome, but *aphesi hamartion*—the remission of sins. The text links *gnosin* (knowledge) directly to this forgiveness. Ignorance of God is the root of sin; knowledge of His mercy is the root of salvation. The scribe’s repetition of *aut aut* (their, their) underscores the personal nature of this forgiveness; it is applied specifically to the sins of the people (*la*, *lao*). The burden is lifted from the specific shoulders of the guilty.

**Verse 78**

**Greek Text**
δια ϲπλαγχνα ε ημων εν οιϲ επιϲκεψε επεϲκεψατο ημαϲ ανατολη εξ ϋψουϲ

**English Translation**
Through bowels of m[ercy] of our [God], in which visited, visited us a Rising from on high.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the visceral language of God's love. *Splanchna* refers to the inward parts, the gut, the seat of deepest compassion. It is through this intense divine emotion that the miracle occurs. The text corrects itself from *episkepse* to *epeskepsato*—emphasizing the historical reality that He *has* visited us. The title given to the Christ is *Anatole*—the Rising, the Dayspring, the East. He is the cosmic dawn breaking the long night of antiquity. He comes *ex hypsous* (from on high), descending to lift us up.

**Verse 79**

**Greek Text**
επιφα τοιϲ εν ϲκο και ϲκια θανατου καθημενοιϲ του κατευθυναι τουϲ ποδαϲ ημων ειϲ ο ϊρηνηϲ

**English Translation**
To shine upon those sitting in dark[ness] and shadow of death, to guide our feet into [the] w[ay] of peace.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The condition of humanity without Christ is depicted as static and moribund: we are *kathemenois* (sitting) in *sko* (darkness) and the shadow of death. We are paralyzed by the gloom. The *Anatole* comes *epipha* (to shine/appear) not merely to illuminate, but to mobilize. The light enables movement. The goal is *kateuthynai*—to straighten or guide our feet. The destination is specific: *eis o* (*odon*) *irenes* (the way of peace). We move from the paralysis of death to the active pilgrimage of peace.

**Verse 80**

**Greek Text**
το δε παιδιον ηϋ και εκρατε και ην ταιϲ ερημοιϲ εωϲ ημεραϲ αναδειξε αυτου προϲ τον ι

**English Translation**
And the child gr[ew] and was strength[ened], and was [in] the deserts until [the] day of his showing to I[srael].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The narrative concludes with the hidden years of the Forerunner. He *hu* (grew) in body and *ekrate* (was strengthened) in spirit. His school was not the academy, but *tais eremois*—the deserts. Silence and solitude are the forge of the prophet. He remained there until the *anadeixe* (showing/manifestation). He could not appear to *I* (*Israel*) until he had been shaped by the wilderness. One must possess God in the desert before offering Him to the city.
