**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν μια των ημερων δι αυτου τον λαον εν τω ϊερω και ευαγγελιζομε ευαγγελιζομενου επεϲτηϲαν οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι γραμματειϲ ϲυν τοιϲ πρεϲβυτεροιϲ

**English Translation**
And it came to pass on one of the days, [as] he [was] through the people in the temple and evangelizing—evangelizing—the chief priests and the scribes with the elders stood by.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal hesitation in the duplication of *euangelizomenou* (evangelizing). It is as if the text itself stammers with the abundance of the Good News being poured out. The phrase *di autou* (through him) appearing before "the people" is a peculiar reading of this Codex, suggesting that the very gathering of the people is mediated *through* His presence. The triad of opposition—priests, scribes, elders—stands in rigid contrast to the flowing, doubled action of the Lord's evangelism.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και ειπαν λεγον προϲ αυτον εν ειπον ημ εν ειπον ημ εν ποια εξουϲια ταυ ποιειϲ η τιϲ εϲ ο δουϲ ϲοι την εξουϲιαν ταυτην

**English Translation**
And they spoke, saying to him: Tell us—tell us—by what authority you do these things, or who is the one who gave to you this authority?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is convulsed with repetition (*eipon hēmin, eipon hēmin*), mirroring the agitation and breathlessness of the accusers. They demand the source of His *exousia* (authority). They see the power, yet they demand the credential. The stuttering in the manuscript reveals the anxiety of the earthly hierarchy when confronted with the source of all Hierarchy. They ask "who gave," not knowing the Giver stands before them.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ειπ ειπ προϲ αυτον αυτουϲ ερωτη ϋμαϲ καγω λογ και ειπατε μοι

**English Translation**
But answering, he said—said—to him [them]: I will ask you also a word, and tell me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the scribe doubles the verb "said" (*eip eip*), and corrects the singular "him" (*auton*) to the plural "them" (*autous*). This correction is theological: though many enemies approach (scribes, priests), Christ addresses the singular spirit of rebellion within them. He counters their demand for authority with a demand for truth. He offers a *logon* (word/reason), engaging their intellect to expose their lack of spirit.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
το βαπτιϲμα το ϊωαν εξ ουρανου ην η εξ ανθρωπων

**English Translation**
The baptism of John: was it from heaven or from men?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A piercing dichotomy. There is no middle ground in the sacraments; they are either *ex ouranou* (from heaven) and binding, or *ex anthrōpōn* (from men) and empty. The Lord uses the Forerunner, John, as the litmus test for their spiritual sight. If they cannot discern the burning lamp of the Forerunner, how shall they endure the Sun of Justice?

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ϲυνελογιζον προϲ αυτουϲ εαυτουϲ λε οτι εαν ει εξ ουρανου ερει δια τι ουκ επι αυτω ·

**English Translation**
But they reasoned with themselves, saying that: If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript abbreviates "believe" (*episteusate*) to a mere *epi*, as if their faith was indeed cut short. Their internal dialogue (*synelogizon*) is not a search for truth, but a calculation of consequence. They fear the question "Why did you not believe?" more than they fear the lie. They are trapped by their own rejection of the divine witness.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
εαν δε ειπωμεν εξ ανθρωπων ο λαοϲ απαϲ καταλι ημαϲ πεπι γαρ εϲτιν ϊωαννην προφη ειναι

**English Translation**
But if we say, 'From men,' the whole people will stone us; for they are persuaded John is a prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here, *katalithasei* (stone) is brutally shortened to *katali*, and *pepeismenos* (persuaded) to *pepi*. The text rushes, just as the mob rushes. The fear of the priesthood is the "whole people" (*laos hapas*). They do not fear God; they fear the stones of the earth. They acknowledge the people's persuasion (*pepi*) regarding the prophet, yet they themselves remain unpersuaded and hard of heart.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και απε μη μη ειδεναι ποθεν

**English Translation**
And they answered [that they did] not—not—know from where.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double negative (*mē mē*) in the Codex is emphatic. It is a defiant ignorance. They do not merely say "we do not know"; they construct a wall of negation. By refusing to identify the source of John's baptism, they forfeit their right to judge the source of Christ's authority. They choose darkness lest the light expose their inconsistency.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο ειπ ειπ αυτοιϲ ουδ εγω ουδε εγω ουδε εγω λεγω ϋμιν εν ποια εξου ταυτα ποιω

**English Translation**
And answering, [Jesus] said—said—to them: Neither I, neither I, neither I tell you by what authority I do these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound textual witness! The scribe repeats "Neither I" (*oude egō*) three times. Is this a mere error, or a Trinitarian seal upon the silence of God? As they denied the witness three times (by fear, by calculation, by lie), so the Lord issues a threefold refusal to cast His pearls before them. He withholds the revelation of His *exousia* because they have despised the revelation of His servant John.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ηρξατο δε προϲ τ τ λαον λεγειν την παραβο ταυτην α εφυτευϲεν αμ και εξεδε εξεδοτο αυτον γεωργοιϲ και απεδημηϲεν χρονουϲ ϊκανουϲ

**English Translation**
And he began to speak to the—the—people this parable: A man planted a vineyard and leased—leased—it to farmers and went abroad for considerable times.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stutter on "leased" (*exede exedoto*) emphasizes the act of entrusting. God gives the vineyard (*ampelōna*, abbreviated *am*) fully to the stewards. The "considerable times" marks the era of the Law and the Prophets, where God's visible presence withdrew to test the fidelity of Israel's leaders. The *anthrōpos* (man) is the Creator, acting in the figure of a planter.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και κερω απεϲτιλ προϲ τουϲ γεωργουϲ δουλον ϊνα απο του καρπου του αμπελωνοϲ δωϲου αυτω οι δε γεωργοι εξαπε αυτον διρ διρ καινον ˙

**English Translation**
And in season he sent to the farmers a slave, that from the fruit of the vineyard they should give to him; but the farmers sent him away, beating—beating—[him] empty-handed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The phonetic spelling *kerō* (for *kairō*, season) reflects the spoken reality of the text. The repetition of *dir* (beating) paints the violence of the rejection. The servant comes for fruit (*karpou*), but receives blows. The word *kainon* (empty) is the judgment of the priesthood: they possess the structure of the vineyard but are devoid of the offering due to the Master.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και εθε προϲεθετο ετερον πεμψαι δουλον ˙ οι δε κακι διραντεϲ και ατιμαϲαντεϲ εξα καινον

**English Translation**
And he added—proceeded—to send another slave; but they, also that one beating and dishonoring, sent away empty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe corrects *ethe* to *prosetheto* (added/proceeded), showing the divine persistence. God does not strike back immediately; He adds mercy upon mercy. The farmers respond with escalation: now they add "dishonoring" (*atimasantes*) to the beating. The abbreviated *kaki* likely stands for *kakeinon* (and that one), linking the servants in a chain of suffering.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και προϲεθετο τρι πεμψαι οι δε κ(αι) τουτον τραυματιϲ τραυματιϲ εξεβαλον

**English Translation**
And he proceeded to send a third; but they, also this one wounding—wounding—cast out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The third mission. The violence culminates in "wounding" (*traumatisantes*), repeated twice in the Codex as a graphical lamentation. They do not merely beat; they seek to destroy the life. *Exebalon* (they cast out) foreshadows the casting out of the Heir outside the city walls. The threefold sending mirrors the patience of the Trinity before the final judgment falls.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε ο του αμ τι ποιη πεμψω τον μου τον αγαπητον ϊϲωϲ τουτον εν

**English Translation**
And the [lord] of the vine[yard] said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved [son]; perhaps this one they will re[spect].'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herein lies the divine deliberation within the Trinity. The Lord of the vineyard, representing the Father, asks "What shall I do?" not out of perplexity, but to demonstrate the magnitude of the next action. He sends not a servant, but the *agapeton* (beloved)—the very title declared at the Jordan. The word *isos* (perhaps) signifies the freedom of the human will; God grants man the capacity to reverence the Son, though He foreknows the rebellion.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ϊδ δε αυτον οι γεωργοι διελογιζοντο προϲ αλληλουϲ λεγοντεϲ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο κλη δευτε α αυ ϊνα ημων γε η κληρονο

**English Translation**
But see[ing] him, the farmers reasoned with one another, saying, 'This is the he[ir]; come, let us k[ill] h[im], so that ours may be[come] the inherita[nce].'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the calculation of malice. They do not kill in ignorance; they recognize the *kleronomos* (heir). Their reasoning (*dielogizonto*) is the logic of usurpation. They believe that by removing the Son, they can seize the covenantal authority for themselves. It is the ultimate foolishness of the creature attempting to displace the Creator to possess the creation.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και εκβαλοντεϲ αυτον εξω του αμ απεκτι τι ουν ποιηϲει αυ ο του αμπε

**English Translation**
And having cast him outside the vine[yard], they kill[ed] [him]. What then will he do to th[em], the [lord] of the viney[ard]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text notes they cast him *exo* (outside) before killing him, prophesying that Christ would suffer outside the gate of Jerusalem, expelled from the camp of Israel. The question "What then will he do?" turns the judicial gaze upon the listeners. The crime against the Son necessitates a response from the Father.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ελευϲεται και απολεϲει τουϲ γεωργουϲ τουτουϲ και δωϲει τον αμ αλλοιϲ α δε ει μη γενοιτο

**English Translation**
He will come and destroy these farmers and will give the vine[yard] to others. But h[earing], they s[aid], 'May it not be!'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment is twofold: destruction of the wicked tenants (the corrupt priesthood) and the transfer of the vineyard to "others" (the Apostles and the Gentiles). The listeners' cry, *me genoito* (May it not be!), reveals they have understood the parable perfectly—they recoil not from the violence of the tenants, but from the loss of their own position.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ο δε εμβλεψαϲ αυτοιϲ ειπεν τι ουν εϲτ εϲτ το γεγραμμενον τουτο λιθον ον α οι οικοδομουντεϲ ουτοϲ εγενηθη ειϲ κεφαλην γω

**English Translation**
But looking at them, he said, 'What then i[s] this that is written: The stone which the builders r[ejected], this one became the head of the cor[ner]?'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ fixes his eyes upon them (*emblepsas*), piercing their defense. He cites the Psalm to show that their rejection is actually the mechanism of His exaltation. The "builders" are the religious authorities; their refusal of the stone does not discard it but establishes it as the *kephalen gonias* (head of the corner), the foundation of the new temple, the Church.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
παϲ ο πεϲ πεϲ επ εκινον τον λι ϲυνθλαϲθη εφ ον δ αν πε λικμηϲει αυτ αυτ

**English Translation**
Everyone fall[ing] on that st[one] will be shattered; but on whomsoever it might fa[ll], it will winnow/crush h[im].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying dichotomy of judgment. To stumble over Christ in this life (unbelief) is to be broken (*sunthlasthesetai*). But the final judgment—the Stone falling upon the sinner—results in being ground to dust (*likmesei*), scattered like chaff before the wind. One describes the offense of the cross; the other, the crushing weight of His return.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και εζητηϲαν οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι γραμματειϲ επι επ αυτον ταϲ χιραϲ εν αυτη τη ωρα και εφοβη τον λαον εγνωϲ γαρ οτι προϲ αυτουϲ ει την παραβολ παραβολ ταυτην

**English Translation**
And the chief priests and the scribes sought to l[ay] h[ands] on him in that very hour, and they fear[ed] the people; for they kne[w] that against them he sp[oke] this parab[le].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The parable acts as a mirror, and they hate the reflection. Instead of repentance, their reaction is immediate violence (*en aute te hora*). They are restrained not by piety, but by cowardice—fear of the *laon* (people). They prove themselves to be the very "wicked tenants" described moments ago.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και παρα απε ενκαθετουϲ αποκρινομενουϲ υποκρινομενουϲ εαυτουϲ δικαιουϲ ειναι ϊνα επιλα αυτου λογου ωϲτε παραδουναι αυτον τη αρχη και εξουϲια του ηγε ˙

**English Translation**
And watch[ing], they se[nt] spies feigning themselves to be righteous, that they might take ho[ld] of his word, so as to deliver him to the rule and authority of the gover[nor].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Since they fear the people, they resort to *enkathetous* (suborned spies). The text exposes their theatricality (*hypokrinomenous*—acting/feigning). Their goal is political: to hand the Messiah over to the *hegemonos* (Roman governor), transferring the blood-guilt to the Gentiles while achieving their own ends.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και επηρωτηϲαν αυτον λεγοντεϲ διδαϲκαλε οιδαμ οτι ορθωϲ λεγειϲ και διδαϲκιϲ και ου λαμβανειϲ προ αλλ επ α την οδ του διδαϲκιϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And they asked him, saying, 'Teacher, we kno[w] that rightly you speak and teach, and do not accept a fa[ce/person], but in tr[uth] the wa[y] of [God] you teach.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The poison of flattery. They speak absolute theological truths—that He teaches rightly and is impartial (*ou lambaneis prosopon*, literally "does not receive the face")—but they use these truths as a snare. They hope His very integrity will force Him into a treasonous statement.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ε ημαϲ και φορον δουναι η ου ˙

**English Translation**
Is it law[ful] for us to give tribute to Cae[sar] or not?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The binary trap. If He approves the tribute, He is a collaborator with Rome and loses the people. If He forbids it, He is a revolutionary and liable to Roman execution. They seek to impale Him on the horns of a dilemma between theocratic purity and political submission.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
κατανοηϲαϲ δε αυτων την πα ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ ˙

**English Translation**
But having perceived their craf[tiness], he said to them:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine mind cannot be deceived. *Katanoesas* implies a thorough understanding; He sees beneath the mask of their feigned righteousness to the *panourgian* (craftiness/knavery) beneath. He does not answer the question they asked, but the intention they hid.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
δειξα μοι δηναριον οι δε εδειξαν αυτω και ειπαν ειπεν τινοϲ εχει εικονα και ε οι δε ει καιϲαροϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Sho[w] me a denarius. And they showed it to him. And he said, 'Whose image and i[nscription] does it have?' And they sa[id], 'Caesar's.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
By asking for the coin, He forces them to reveal they are carrying the graven image of the emperor within the holy precincts. The *eikona* (image) denotes ownership. If the coin bears Caesar's image, it belongs to his realm. The unspoken corollary is the true answer: Man bears the *eikona* of God (Genesis 1:26), and therefore, man must render himself unto God.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ειπεν προϲ αυ τοινυν απο τα καιϲαροϲ καιϲαρι και τα του τω

**English Translation**
But he said to [them]: Therefore [render] from the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of the [?]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine economy in the brevity of the scribe. The command is fractured, yet the imperative remains: *toinyn* (therefore). The text reads *apo ta Kaisaros*—literally "from the things of Caesar"—indicating that the tribute is merely a return of what already belongs to the earthly realm. The sentence concludes abruptly with *ta tou to* (the things of the...), leaving the divine possessor unspoken in this fragment. This silence is catechetical; we know it refers to God (*Theos*), yet the omission reminds us that the things of the Divine are ineffable and not to be equated casually with the coinage of emperors.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και ουκ ι επιλαβε του ρηματοϲ εναντιον του λα και θαυμαϲαντεϲ επι τη αποκριϲει αυτου εϲιγηϲαν ˙

**English Translation**
And not [able] to take hold of the saying before the peo[ple], and marveling at his answer, they became silent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The negation *ouk i* is truncated, likely for *ouk ischusan* (they did not have strength), showing the feebleness of human entrapment against the Logos. They sought to *epilabe* (seize upon) a word, as a hunter snares prey, yet found nothing. This occurred *enantion tou la*—before the "peo[ple]"—the public witness of their failure. Their reaction is twofold: *thaumasantes* (marveling) and *esigēsan* (they fell silent). In the presence of Truth, the dialectic of the sophist must yield to the silence of awe.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
προϲελθοντεϲ δε τινεϲ των ϲαδδου οι λεγοντεϲ αναϲταϲιν μη ει επηρωτηϲαν αυτον

**English Translation**
And having approached, certain of the Saddu[cees], the ones saying a resurrection not to [be], asked him,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here enter the *Saddou*—the Sadducees—defined strictly by their negation. The text describes them as *legontes anastasin mē ei* (saying a resurrection not to [be]). The verb *einai* (to be) is shortened to *ei*, mirroring how their doctrine shortens the hope of Israel. They approach the Source of Life to argue for the finality of death, a profound irony that the Evangelist exposes by juxtaposing their denial with their interrogation of the Living One.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ διδαϲκαλε μωϲηϲ εγραψεν ημιν ε τινοϲ αδελφοϲ αποθανη εχων γυναικα κ(αι) ουτοϲ ατεκνοϲ ην ϊνα λαβη ο αδελφοϲ αυτου την γυναικα κ(αι) ουτοϲ ατεκνοϲ η ϊνα λαβη ο αδελφοϲ αυτου την γυναικα και εξα ϲπερμα τω αδελφω αυτου

**English Translation**
Saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, if anyone's brother dies having a wife, and this one was childless, that his brother should take the wife, and [if] this one be childless that his brother should take the wife, and [raise up] seed to his brother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here contains a curious repetition, stating twice the condition of the brother taking the wife. Whether a scribal dittography or an emphatic recording, it spiritually underscores the tedious, cyclical futility of the Levirate law without the hope of resurrection. They are trapped in a loop of marrying and dying to preserve a name on earth (*sperma*), blind to the eternal name granted in heaven. They invoke Moses, but they trap themselves in the letter of the law regarding mortality.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
επτα ουν αδελφοι ηϲαν παρ ημιν και ο πρωτοϲ λαβων γυναικα απεθανεν ατε

**English Translation**
Seven therefore brothers were beside us; and the first, having taken a wife, died child[less].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The number seven suggests completeness in this earthly tragedy. The first brother's life is summarized in three acts: existence, marriage, and death. The word *ate* cuts off *ateknos* (childless), a textual abruptness that mimics the cutting off of his lineage. Death is the punctuation mark of the fallen world, rendering the "taking" of a wife ultimately fruitless in the face of the grave.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
και ο δευτε

**English Translation**
And the seco[nd]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A stark fragment. *Kai ho deute*—"And the seco[nd]." The text does not even grant him the dignity of a verb or a death description in this line. He is merely a number in the sequence of mortality. This brevity preaches a sermon on the vanity of earthly succession; one generation passes to another so quickly that the scribe barely lifts the pen.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
και ο τριτοϲ ε ελαβον αυτην ωϲ δε και οι ε ου κατελιπον τεκνα και απεθα ·

**English Translation**
And the third [?] took her; likewise also the se[ven?] did not leave children and di[ed].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cycle continues with *ho tritos* (the third). The phrase *hoi e* likely abbreviates *hoi hepta* (the seven). The grim summary is *ouk katelipon tekna* (they did not leave children) and *apetha* (died). The truncation of "died" (*apetha* for *apethanon*) again signals the abrupt cessation of life. The accumulation of husbands without fruit emphasizes that death swallows all earthly attempts at immortality through procreation.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ϋϲτερον δε και η γυνη απεθαν απεθαν

**English Translation**
And afterward also the wife died died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the emphasis in the manuscript: *apethan apethan* (died died). The repetition is striking. Is it a scribal error? Or does it signify the finality of her death—she died to this world, and in the Sadducees' view, she died to the next? It serves as a double seal on the tomb, emphasizing the absolute victory of death in the eyes of those who deny the Resurrection. She who was the bride of seven is now the bride of dust.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
εν τη ουν αναϲταϲι τινοϲ αυτων εϲται γυνη οι γαρ επτα εϲχον αυτην γυναικα

**English Translation**
In the resurrection therefore, of which of them shall she be wife? For the seven had her as wife.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the *reductio ad absurdum* of the carnal mind. They project the necessities of the flesh—property and possession (*tinos... estai*, "of whom shall she be")—onto the spiritual realm. They see the woman not as a soul to be redeemed, but as an object of contention between seven claimants. They cannot conceive of a communion that is not based on exclusive marital rights.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο οι υϊοι του αιω τουτου ︴ γαμου και γαμιϲκονται

**English Translation**
And said to them the [Jesus?]: The sons of [this] a[ge] marry and are given in marriage.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord distinguishes the realms. *Hoi huioi tou aiō[nos] toutou*—the sons of this age. The scribe leaves a gap or symbol (︴) after "this age," physically separating the temporal from the eternal on the parchment. Marriage (*gamou* for *gamousin*) is an ordinance for the preservation of the species in a dying world ("this age"). It is a remedy for mortality, unnecessary where death holds no sway.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
οι δε καταξιωθεν του αιωνοϲ ε τυχειν και τηϲ αναϲταϲεωϲ τηϲ εκ νεκρων ου γαμουϲιν ουτε γαμιζονται

**English Translation**
But those accounted worthy to obtain th[at] age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The contrast is sharp. *Kataxiōthen[tes]*—those accounted worthy. Salvation is a matter of worthiness granted by grace, not natural right. They obtain *aiōnos e[keinou]*—that age (the text abbreviates "that"). In the age to come, the social structures of biological necessity are dissolved. There is no marrying because there is no dying; the replacement of the population is no longer required.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ουτε γαρ αποθανιν ετι δυνανται ϊϲαγγε γαρ εϲιν ειϲιν ειϲιν και ϋϊ ειϲιν τηϲ α ϋϊοι οντεϲ ˙

**English Translation**
For neither can they die anymore; for equal to ang[els] they are are are, and so[ns] they are of the [resurrection?], being sons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A glorious textual ecstasy! The scribe writes *eisin eisin eisin*—"they are, they are, they are." This threefold repetition affirms existence in the highest degree. In the face of the Sadducees' denial of life, the text stammers with the abundance of being. They are *isagge[loi]* (equal to angels) and *huioi* (sons) of the *a[nastaseōs]* (resurrection). They are no longer defined by who they married, but by whose children they are—children of the Resurrection, and thus children of God. The stuttering text proclaims a life that cannot be silenced.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
οτι δε εγει οι νεκροι και μωϲηϲ εμη επι τηϲ βα ωϲ λεγει τ αβρααμ και ϊϲακ ϊϲαακ και ϊακωβ

**English Translation**
But that the dead rise [εγει], even Moses indicated [εμη] at the bush [βα], as he calls the [God of] Abraham and Isaac Isaac and Jacob.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the scribal hand trembling before the Patriarchs, writing "Isaac" twice (*ϊϲακ ϊϲαακ*), a dittography that inadvertently emphasizes the individual covenant God holds with each soul. The Lord proves the Resurrection not by a new philosophy, but by the Torah itself. If God *is* the God of Abraham, and God is Life, then Abraham must live. The abbreviated *εμη* (indicated) and *βα* (bush) in our codex reflect the scribe's haste to record this fundamental proof: the burning bush was not only a sign of deliverance from Egypt but a sign of deliverance from the grave.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
δε ουκ εϲτιν νεκρων αλλα ζ παντεϲ γαρ αυτω ζωϲιν

**English Translation**
Now He is not of the dead but of the living [ζ]; for all live to Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound metaphysical truth is compressed here. The manuscript abbreviates "living" (*ζωντων*) to a single *ζ*, as if life itself is the alpha and omega of God's nature. "For all live to Him": To us, the departed seem annihilated; to God, they are present. Death is a horizon for the creature, not the Creator. The souls of the just are held in the hand of God, alive and awaiting the final restoration.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθεντεϲ δε τινεϲ των γραμ ειπαν αυ διδαϲκαλε κα ειπαϲ

**English Translation**
And answering, some of the scribes [γραμ] said to Him [αυ], "Teacher, You spoke well [κα]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the adversaries are compelled to bow before the Truth. The scribes (*γραμ*), usually hostile, here align with Christ because He has silenced the Sadducees, their rivals who denied the resurrection. Yet, their praise ("You spoke well") is patronizing; they judge the Word of God as if they were the arbiters of truth. They approve of Him only when He affirms their own doctrine, not because He is the Lord.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ουκετι γαρ ετολμων επε αυτον ουδ

**English Translation**
For no longer did they dare to ask [επε] Him anything [ουδ].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The silence of the defeated. The dialectic traps of the world—politics, taxes, marriage laws—are exhausted. The abbreviation *ουδ* (for *ouden*, nothing) signifies the total emptiness of their intellectual arsenal. When the Divine Wisdom speaks, human sophistry is not merely answered; it is rendered obsolete. They do not dare, for they realize they are in the presence of an Authority that transcends their books.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυτουϲ πωϲ λεγουϲι τον ειναι δ δ

**English Translation**
But He said to them, "How do they say the [Christ] is David's [δ] [son]?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Now the Lord goes on the offensive. He does not leave them in their silence but leads them to the mystery of the Incarnation. The text here is heavily abbreviated (*δ δ* for *David's son*), reflecting the common knowledge of the Messianic title. But Christ challenges the limitation of this title. If He is merely David's son by flesh, He is a political figure; if He is David's Lord, He is God. He forces them to look beyond the genealogy to the theology.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ γαρ δ δ λε εν βιβλω ψαλμ ψαλμ > ειπεν ο τω > μου καθου εκ > δε μου

**English Translation**
For David [δ] himself says [λε] in the book of Psalms Psalms [ψαλμ ψαλμ]: "The [Lord] said to my [Lord], Sit at my right [hand]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats "Psalms" (*ψαλμ ψαλμ*), perhaps a slip, or perhaps an unconscious reverence for the psalter. The citation from Psalm 109 (LXX) is the hammer that breaks the Jewish conception of a merely human Messiah. "The Lord said to my Lord": Two Lords are revealed, yet One God. The Father speaks to the Son. The Son is invited to the position of equal power (*right hand*). This text is the cornerstone of our understanding of the Trinity in the Old Testament.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
εωϲ αν > θω τουϲ εχθρουϲ > ϲου ϋποποδιον > των ποδων ϲου

**English Translation**
"Until I place [θω] Your enemies as a footstool of Your feet."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imagery is of total subjugation. The "enemies" are not merely Romans or rival nations, but Sin, Death, and the Devil. The Incarnation aims at this victory. The footstool implies that the enemies are not destroyed into non-existence but are made to serve the glory of the Conqueror. Even the demons, in their defeat, acknowledge His justice.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
δ ουν αυτον καλει και πωϲ αυτου εϲτιν ˙

**English Translation**
David [δ] therefore calls Him [Lord], and how is He his [son]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the theological knot that only the Virgin Birth can untie. As God, He is David's Creator and Lord; as Man, He is David's descendant. The scribes could not answer because they did not know the mystery of the two natures in one Person. The question hangs in the air, marked by the punctuation in the codex, demanding faith where logic reaches its limit.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
ακουοντοϲ δε π π του λαου ειπ ειπ τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυ ·

**English Translation**
And while all [π π] the people were listening, He said said [ειπ ειπ] to His disciples [αυ]:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see again the scribal stutter (*π π* for *pantos*, *ειπ ειπ* for *eipen*), marking a moment of transition. Christ turns from the adversaries to His own flock. He speaks "while all the people were listening"—this is a public warning against the clerical class. It is a dangerous moment for a Bishop to read, for the Lord is about to dismantle the prestige of the religious leadership.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
προϲεχετε απο των γραμματε των θελοντων εν ϲτολαιϲ περιπα και φιλουντων α εν ταιϲ αγοραιϲ και πρωτο εν ταιϲ ϲυναγωγαιϲ και πρωτοκλιϲιαϲ εν τοιϲ διπνοιϲ

**English Translation**
Beware of the scribes [γραμματε], who wish to walk [περιπα] in robes, and love greetings [α] in the marketplaces, and first seats [πρωτο] in the synagogues, and first couches in the suppers [διπνοιϲ].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A mirror for the clergy. The scribe abbreviates the very things the vain priests desire: greetings (*α* for *aspasmous*) and first seats (*πρωτο*). It is as if the text hurries past these vanities. The sin is not in the robe or the seat, but in the *thelo* (wishing) and *philo* (loving) of them. It is the lust for ecclesiastical prominence. To walk in robes is to demand visual reverence; to seek the first seat is to usurp the place of humility.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
οι κα ταϲ οικιαϲ των χηρων · και προφαϲει μακρα προϲευχονται ου λημψονται πε κριμα

**English Translation**
Who devour [κα] the houses of widows, and for a pretense pray at length; these shall receive greater [πε] judgment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter concludes with a terrifying verdict. *Oi ka* (those who devour) refers to the exploitation of the vulnerable under the guise of religion. They use "long prayers" as a mask for avarice. The "greater judgment" (*perissoteron krima*) confirms that there are degrees of punishment in Hell. Those who knew the Law and used it to prey upon the weak shall suffer more than the ignorant sinner. Let every priest tremble at this word.
