**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ ΔΕ ΕΝ ϹΑΒ ΔΙΑΠΟΡΕΥΕ ΔΙΑΠΟΡΕΥ ΑΥΤΟΝ ΔΙΑ ΤΩΝ ϹΠΟ ΚΑΙ ΕΤΙΛΛ ΕΤΙΛΛ ΟΙ ΜΑΘΗΤΑΙ ΑΥΤΟΥ ϹΤΑΧΥΑϹ ΚΑΙ ΗϹΘΙ ΨΩΧΟΝΤΕϹ ΤΑΙϹ ΧΕΡϹΙΝ

**English Translation**
And it happened on a Sabbath he was passing through—passing through the grainfields, and his disciples were plucking—plucking ears of grain and eating, rubbing them with their hands.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the scribal stuttering upon *diaporeu* (passing through) and *etill* (plucking). It is as if the text itself hesitates at the transgression of the law, or perhaps emphasizes the deliberate nature of the act. The Lord passes through the fields of the law, and His disciples pluck the old grain to reveal the new kernel. They rub the chaff away with their hands, just as the spiritual man must rub away the letter of the law to find the nourishing spirit within. The Sabbath is not for idleness, but for the harvesting of truth.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ΤΙΝΕϹ ΔΕ ΤΩΝ ΦΑΡΙ ΕΙΠΟΝ ΤΙ ΠΟΙΕΙΤΑΙ Ο ΟΥΧ ΟΥΚ ΕΞΕ ΠΟΙΕΙΝ ΤΟΙϹ ϹΑΒΒΑϹΙΝ ·

**English Translation**
But some of the Pharisees said, "Why do you do what is not—not lawful to do on the Sabbaths?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusers speak from the shadows of the letter. The repetition of the negative *ouch ouk* (not, not) in the manuscript betrays the vehemence of their denial. They see the action but miss the actor. They ask "Why do you do?" to the disciples, but their hearts strike at the Master. They are bound by the plural "Sabbaths," seeing only days to be counted, not the eternal Rest that has walked among them.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ΚΑΙ ΑΠΟ Ο ΠΡΟϹ ΑΥΤΟΥϹ ΕΙΠΕΝ ΟΥ ΤΟΥΤΟ ΑΝΕΓΝΩ Ο ΕΠΟΙΗϹΕΝ ΟΤΕ ΕΠΙΝΑϹΕΝ ΑΥ ΚΑΙ ΟΙ ΜΕΤ ΑΥΤΟΥ

**English Translation**
And answering, the [Jesus] said to them, "Have you not read this, what he did when he hungered, he and those with him?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the text is stark. The name of David is absent, represented only by the pronoun *au* (he), or perhaps implied in the silence. It is as though the Bishop of our souls points not to the king's name, but to the king's authority. "What *he* did." Necessity overrides ritual. Hunger, when it drives one to God's altar, is a holier thing than a fullness that keeps one from it. The Lord links His disciples' hunger to the royal hunger of old, establishing a lineage not of blood, but of spirit.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
ΩϹ ΠΩϹ ΕΙϹΗΛΘΕΝ ΕΙϹ ΤΟΝ ΟΙΚΟΝ ΤΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΤΟΥϹ ΑΡΤΟΥϹ ΤΗϹ ΠΡΟΘΕϹΕΩϹ ΕΦΑ ΚΑΙ ΕΔΩΚΕΝ ΚΑΙ ΤΟΙϹ ΜΕΤ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΟΥϹ ΟΥΚ ΕΞΕϹΤΙΝ ΦΑΓΕΙΝ ΕΙ ΜΗ ΜΟ ΤΟΥϹ ΪΕΡΕΙϹ

**English Translation**
How he entered into the house of the [God], and the loaves of the presentation he ate and gave also to those with him, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reads *oikon tou* (house of the...), leaving the Divine Name implied, a trembling before the Holy of Holies. David ate the bread of the Presence—the *protheseos*—which prefigures the Eucharist. He gave to those with him, making them priests by association. So too, Christ makes His disciples priests of the new order, entitled to the grain of the Sabbath. The law of the sanctuary yields to the law of Mercy, for the true Temple is the Body of the Lord.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ΚΑΙ ΕΛΕΓΕΝ ΑΥΤΟΙϹ ΟΤΙ ΕϹΤΙΝ ΤΟΥ ϹΑΒ Ο ΤΟΥ ΑΝ

**English Translation**
And he said to them that he is of the Sabbath, the [Son] of [Man].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound ellipsis! The text reads *o tou an*—"the [Son] of [Man]"—abbreviated to the point of mystery. The Lord asserts He is *of* the Sabbath. He does not merely rule it; He is its substance. The Sabbath was made for the restoration of man, and here stands the Man, the Second Adam. The scribal brevity here forces us to look past the words to the reality: the Creator of time stands within time, claiming the seventh day as His own domain.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ ΔΕ ΕΝ ΕΤΕ ϹΑΒΒΑΤΩ ΕΙϹΕΛ ΑΥΤΟΝ ΕΙϹ ΤΗΝ ϹΥΝΑΓΩΓΗΝ ΚΑΙ ΔΙΔΑϹΚΙΝ ΚΑΙ ΗΝ ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟϹ ΕΚΕΙ ΚΑΙ Η ΧΕΙΡ ΑΥΤΟΥ Η ΔΕΞΙΑ ΗΝ ΞΗΡΑ

**English Translation**
And it happened on another Sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught; and a man was there, and his right hand was withered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The right hand, the instrument of action and blessing, is withered (*xera*—dry, dead). This man is an image of the synagogue itself: present in the place of prayer, but unable to work the works of God, dried up by the letter of the law. Christ enters to teach (*didaskin*), and His teaching is the moisture that will revitalize the dry bones. The "other" Sabbath signifies the new era dawning within the old week.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ΠΑ ΔΕ ΑΥΤ ΑΥΤ ΟΙ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕΙϹ ΚΑΙ ΟΙ ΦΑΡΙϹΑΙΟΙ ΕΙ ΕΝ ΤΩ ϹΑΒΒΑΤΩ ΘΕΡΑΠΕΥΕΙ ΪΝΑ ΕΥΡΩ ΚΑΤΗΓΟΡΙΝ ΑΥ ΚΑΤΗΓΟΡΙΑΝ ΚΑΤ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΚΑΤΗΓΟΡΙΑΝ ΚΑΤ ΑΥΤΟΥ

**English Translation**
And the Scribes and the Pharisees were watching him—him, if on the Sabbath he heals, so that they might find to accuse him—an accusation against him—an accusation against him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Witness the agitation in the text! *Kategorian kat autou* is repeated, echoing the relentless malice of the adversaries. They watch "him—him" (*aut aut*). Their eyes are fixed on the Savior not to adore, but to entrap. They seek a pretext in the miracle. It is the madness of the legalist: to prefer a withered hand and a kept rule over a healed man and a glorified God. The repetition signifies the compounding of their sin.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ΑΥΤΟϹ ΔΕ ΗΔΕΙ ΤΟΥϹ ΔΙΑΛΟΓΙϹΜΟΥϹ ΑΥΤΩΝ ΕΙΠΕΝ ΔΕ ΤΩ ΑΝΔΡΙ ΤΩ ΤΗΝ ΞΗΡΑΝ ΕΧ ΕΧ ΤΗΝ ΧΕΙΡΑ ΕΓΕΙΡΕ ΚΑΙ ϹΤΗΘΙ ΕΙϹ ΤΟ ΜΕϹΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΑΝΑϹΤΑϹ ΕϹΤΗ

**English Translation**
But he knew their reasonings; but he said to the man having—having the withered hand, "Rise and stand into the midst." And rising, he stood.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He knows the *dialogismous*—the internal dialogues of their hearts. He commands the man to the center (*meson*). The one who was marginalized by his infirmity is now the centerpiece of divine revelation. "Rise and stand." It is a resurrection command. The man with the withered hand must first stand up in faith before he can stretch out in power. The stutter *ech ech* (having, having) underlines the burden of his affliction which he is about to cast off.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ΕΙΠΕΝ ΔΕ Ο ΠΡΟϹ ΑΥΤΟΥϹ ΕΠΕΡΩΤΩ ΫΜΑϹ ΕΙ ΕΞΕϹΤΙΝ ΤΩ ϹΑΒΒΑΤΩ ΑΓΑΘΟ Η ΚΑΚΟ ΨΥΧΗΝ ϹΩϹΑΙ Η ΑΠΟΛΕϹΑΙ

**English Translation**
But the [Jesus] said to them, "I ask you if it is lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a soul or to destroy?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord places the choice starkly: *agatho* (good) or *kako* (evil). There is no neutrality. To neglect to save is to destroy. On the Sabbath, God rests from creation, but He never rests from providence. If God ceased to work good on the Sabbath, the universe would crumble. Therefore, to heal is the ultimate Sabbath work—it restores the creation to its intended rest. He silences them by elevating the law to the level of life and death.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ΚΑΙ ΠΕΡΙΒΛΕΨΑΜΕ ΠΑΝΤΑϹ ΑΥΤΟΥϹ ΕΙΠΕΝ ΤΩ ΑΝΘΡΩ ΕΚΤΙΝΟΝ Τ Τ ΧΕΙΡΑ ϹΟΥ Ο ΔΕ ΕΞΕ ΚΑΙ ΑΠΕΚΑ ΑΠΕΚΑΤΕϹΤΑΘΗ Η ΧΕΙΡ ΑΥΤΟΥ

**English Translation**
And looking around at them all, he said to the man, "Stretch out the—the hand of yours." And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored—restored.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He looks around (*periblepsame*), a gaze of judgment and sorrow. The command "Stretch out" (*ektinon*) requires the man to attempt the impossible. In the attempt, the grace is given. The manuscript stutters *apeka apekatesthathe* (restored, restored), capturing the very moment of the miracle—the vibration of the nerves, the sudden rush of life, the double confirmation of the cure. The hand is given back to the man, and the man is given back to God.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ΑΥΤΟΙ ΔΕ ΕΠΛΗϹΘΗ ΑΝΟΙΑϹ ΚΑΙ ΔΙΕΛΑΛΟΥΝ ΠΡΟϹ ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥϹ ΤΙ ΑΝ ΠΟΙΗϹΙΕΝ ΤΩ

**English Translation**
But they were filled with madness, and discussed with one another what they might do to the [Jesus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They are filled not with wonder, but with *anoia*—mindlessness, folly, madness. The light of the miracle blinds those who love the darkness. While the man's hand is restored to function, their minds wither into dysfunction. They conspire against the Life-giver. The text leaves the object of their malice simply as *to* (the...), implying the Unnameable Holy One whom they seek to destroy.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ΕΓΕΝΕΤΟ ΔΕ ΕΝ ΤΑΙϹ ΗΜΕΡΑΙϹ ΤΑΥΤΑΙϹ ΕΞΕΛΘΕΙΝ ΑΥΤΟΝ ΕΙϹ ΤΟ ΟΡΟϹ ΠΡΟϹΕΥ ΚΑΙ ΗΝ ΔΙ Ε ΕΝ ΕΝ ΤΗ ΠΡΟϹΕΥΧΗ ΤΟΥ

**English Translation**
And it happened in these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and was spending the night—night in the prayer of the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He ascends the mountain, the place of encounter. The scribal repetition *di e en en* (spending the night) emphasizes the duration of His vigil. He wrestles in the darkness for the light of the world. The phrase *proseuche tou* (prayer of the...) lacks the divine name, yet implies the intimate communion of the Son with the Father. Before He chooses His apostles, He immerses Himself in the "prayer of God," showing us that all true ministry flows from the silence of the mountain.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και οτε εγενετο η προϲεφω τουϲ μαθη αυτου και εκλε απ αυ δωδεκα ουϲ και αποϲτολουϲ ωνομαϲεν

**English Translation**
And when it became [day], he called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the order of the Lord: first the prayer of the night (implied by the arrival of day), then the calling of the many, and finally the election of the few. He calls them "disciples" first, for one must be a learner before he can be a teacher. He names them "apostles"—sent ones—conferring upon them a dignity that originates not in their merit but in His voice. The number twelve is chosen to mirror the patriarchs, establishing the Church as the true Israel of God.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ϲιμω ον και ωνομα πετρον · και τον αδελ αυτου · και ϊακωβον και ϊωαννην και φιλιππον κ(αι) βαρθολομαιον

**English Translation**
Simon, whom also he named Peter; and the brother of him; and Jacob and John and Philip and Bartholomew.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we see the primacy of the new name: Simon becomes Peter, the Rock. In this specific reading before us, the brother of Peter is mentioned solely by his relation to the Rock ("the brother of him"), concealing his own name to elevate the bond of blood and spirit. The pairs proceed: Jacob and John, the sons of thunder, followed by Philip and Bartholomew. The Lord yokes them together, that they might bear the burden of the Gospel in company, not in isolation.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και μαθθαιον και θωμαν και ϊακωβον αλφαιου και ϲιμωνα τον κα ζηλωτ ζηλωτ

**English Translation**
And Matthew and Thomas and Jacob [son] of Alphaeus and Simon the [one] called Zealot Zealot.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The net of the Lord gathers all kinds. Matthew the publican stands with Thomas; Jacob of Alphaeus stands with Simon. Notice the scribe’s repetition in our text: "Zealot Zealot." It is as if the text itself stammers to emphasize the burning fervor of this Simon. The grace of Christ takes the zeal of earthly revolution and sanctifies it into a zeal for the Kingdom of Heaven.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και ϊουδαν ϊακωβου και ϊουδαν ϊϲκαριωτ οϲ εγενετο προδο

**English Translation**
And Judas [son] of Jacob and Judas Iscariot, who became a betrayer.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful mystery is inscribed here. Two bear the name of Judas: one of faithful lineage (of Jacob), the other of Iscariot. The text says he "became" (*egeneto*) a betrayer. He was not created a devil, nor was he chosen as a traitor initially, but through the corruption of avarice, he transformed his office into judgment. Even the chosen vessel can crack if it does not hold the water of life.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και καταβαϲ με αυτων εϲτη επι τοπου πεδινου και οχλοϲ πολυϲ μαθητων αυτου και πληθοϲ πολυ του λαου απο παϲηϲ τηϲ ϊου και ϊερουϲα και πιραιαϲ κ(αι) τηϲ παραλιου τυρου και ϲειδωνοϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having come down with them, he stood upon a level place, and a great crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem and Perea and the coast of Tyre and Sidon;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord descends from the mountain to the "level place" (*topou pedinou*). He humbles Himself to meet the infirmity of the crowd. Look at the geography of salvation: not only Judea and Jerusalem, the centers of the Law, but Perea and the Gentile coasts of Tyre and Sidon. The sea and the land, the Jew and the Greek, all are drawn by the magnetic pull of the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
οι ηλθον ακουϲαι αυ και ϊαθηναι α των νοϲων αυ και οι ενοχλου απο ακαθαρτων εθε

**English Translation**
Who came to hear him and to be healed from their diseases; and those troubled by unclean [spirits] were healed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The order of the soul precedes the body: they came first "to hear" and then "to be healed." Yet the Lord, in His mercy, attends to both. The text speaks of those "troubled" (*enochlou*) by unclean spirits. The demons cause disturbance and noise; the presence of Christ brings silence and sanity. The healing is passive in the text—they *were* healed—showing that the power rests entirely in the Divine Physician.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και παϲ ο οχλοϲ εζητο εζητο απτεϲθαι αυτου ο δυναμιϲ παρ αυ εξηρχετο και ϊατο πανταϲ

**English Translation**
And all the crowd sought sought to touch him, because power went out from him and healed all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the flesh is visible in the scribal doubling "sought sought" (*ezēto ezēto*). They did not merely ask; they strove to touch the hem of His humanity. For power (*dynamis*) is not a static attribute of God but an active emanation. It "went out" from Him. He is the fountain that flows without being emptied, healing not a few, but "all" who touched Him in faith.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και αυ επαραϲ τουϲ ο αυτου ειϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου ελεγεν μακαριοι οι πτω τω οτι ϋμετερα εϲτ η βαϲιλια του

**English Translation**
And he, lifting his eyes to his disciples, said: Blessed [are] the poor... [textual uncertainty: tō]... for yours is the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He lifts His eyes, separating the disciples from the multitude. The beatitude is for the "poor" (*ptōchoi*). Our manuscript contains a difficult stutter or abbreviation (*tō*), perhaps hinting at "the spirit" or merely a scribe's hesitation. But the pronouncement is absolute: the Kingdom is not a future hope but a present possession ("is yours"). God is the wealth of those who have no earth.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
μακαριοι οι πιν νυν οτι χορτα χορταϲθηϲεϲθαι χορταϲθηϲονται μακαριοι οι κλαιον νυν οτι γελα

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] those hungering now, for... [you shall be filled, you shall be filled]... you shall be filled. Blessed [are] those weeping now, for [you] shall laugh.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles mightily here, writing the promise of filling three times in various forms, as if overwhelmed by the abundance of the prophecy. "You shall be filled" is the destiny of the hungry. The weeping of this present age (*nyn*) is the necessary precursor to the laughter of the age to come. It is a holy laughter, the joy of the resurrection, which swallows up the sorrow of the cross.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
μακαριοι εϲτε οτ οτ μιϲηϲωϲιν ϋμαϲ οι ανθρωποι και οταν αφοριϲωϲιν και ονιδιϲωϲ και εκβαλωϲιν το ονομα ϋμων ωϲ πονηρον ενεκα του ϋϊου του α

**English Translation**
Blessed are you when when men hate you, and when they separate [you] and reproach [you] and cast out your name as evil for the sake of the Son of [Man].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition "when when" (*ot ot*) confirms the certainty of persecution. The world uses three weapons: separation (excommunication), reproach (verbal abuse), and defamation (casting out the name). To have one's name called "evil" by the world is the badge of honor for the Christian, provided it is suffered "for the sake of the Son of Man." We lose our good standing with men to gain our standing with God.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
χαρητε εν εκεινη τη ημερα και ϲκιρ ϊδου γαρ ο μιϲθοϲ ϋμων πο εν τω ο κα ταυτα γαρ εποιο εποιο τοιϲ προφηταιϲ οι πατερεϲ αυτων

**English Translation**
Rejoice in that day and leap; for behold, your reward [is] much in [heaven]; for according to these things your fathers did did to the prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We are commanded not merely to endure, but to "leap" (*skirtēsate*)—a motion of ecstatic joy. Why? Because persecution places us in the genealogy of the prophets. The scribal repetition "did did" (*epoio epoio*) emphasizes the habitual violence of the fathers against the truth. If they persecuted the prophets, and they persecute you, then you are true sons of the prophets and heirs to their reward in heaven.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
πλην ουαι ϋμιν τοιϲ πλουϲιοιϲ ο απεχεται την παρακληϲιν

**English Translation**
But woe to you the rich, [for] you have in full the consolation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the thunderbolt. "Woe" (*ouai*) is the cry of mourning. The rich are not punished merely for having gold, but because they have received their "consolation" (*paraklēsin*) already. The word *apechete* is commercial: "payment received in full." They have cashed out their eternal inheritance for temporal comfort. They have nothing left to hope for; their heaven has been spent on earth.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν οι εμπε νυν οτι πιναϲετε ουαι οι γελωντεϲ ν ν οτι πενθηϲεται και κλαυϲεται

**English Translation**
Woe to you who are fil[led] now, because you shall hunger; woe to those laughing n[ow], because you shall mourn and weep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrifying temporal marker *nyn* (now). The scribe has abbreviated the condition of being filled to *empe*, yet the meaning strikes the soul: satiety in this present age is a precursor to spiritual famine. The text warns those "laughing now" (*gelōntes*), employing the phonetic spelling *penthesetai* and *klausetai* (with the *ai* diphthong for *e*) to indicate the certainty of future grief. The Bishop notes that the laughter of the world is fleeting, but the weeping of judgment is the inevitable harvest of present frivolity.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ουαι οταν καλωϲ ει ϋμαϲ οι αν παντεϲ κα ταυτα τα αυτα γαρ εποιο εποιο τοιϲ ψευδοπροφη προφηταιϲ ψευδοπροφηταιϲ οι πατερεϲ αυ

**English Translation**
Woe when all men speak well of you; for according to these same things their fathers did did to the false proph- prophets false prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here stutters, witnessing the confusion of human vanity. The scribe writes *epoio epoio* (did, did) and repeats *pseudoprophētais* (false prophets) in a tangled chain. This dittography, accidental by the hand, serves a homiletic purpose: it emphasizes the repetitive folly of history. Just as the fathers honored the deceivers, so too does the world flatter those who preach comfort. The woe is pronounced against universal acclaim (*kalōs eipōsin*), for truth is rarely sweet to every ear.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
αλλα λε τοιϲ ακουουϲιν αγαπαται τουϲ ε υμων κα ποιειται τοιϲ μιϲουϲιν ϋμαϲ

**English Translation**
But I s[ay] to those hearing: Love your e[nemies] and do [good] to those hating you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is abbreviated, *le* standing for *legō* (I say), and *tous e* for the enemies (*echthrous*). The command is directed specifically *tois akouousin* (to those hearing)—implying that not all have ears to hear this difficult doctrine. The imperative *agapatai* (love ye) demands a supernatural affection, coupled with action: *poieite* (do). We must not merely feel, but *do* towards those who hate us, filling in the gaps of their malice with our charity.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ευ τουϲ κατα ϋμαϲ προϲευχεϲθαι περι των επηρεα ·

**English Translation**
Bl[ess] those cur[sing] you, pray concerning those mis[treating you].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe reduces the commands to their roots—*eu* for *eulogeite* (bless) and *kata* for *katarōmenous* (cursing)—stripping the verse to its raw conflict. We are to meet the *kata* (downward force of a curse) with the *eu* (good word of blessing). The word *epērea* suggests those who abuse or mistreat; prayer is the only shield against such spite. We do not pray for their destruction, but *peri* (concerning) them, placing their souls in the hands of God.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
τω τυπτοντι ϲε ειϲ επι τ τ δεξιαν ϲιαγονα παρεχε και την αλλην και απο του αιροντοϲ ϲου το ϊ και τον χιτωνα μη κωλυ ·

**English Translation**
To the one striking you on the the right cheek, offer also the other; and from the one taking away your cl[oak], do not withhold the tunic also.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering *epi t t* (on the the) draws attention to the specific location of the insult: the *dexian* (right) cheek. To be struck there implies a backhanded blow, an insult of honor rather than mere violence. The Christian response is total vulnerability. The text abbreviates *himation* (cloak) to *to i*, signaling the lesser value of material goods compared to the soul's disposition. We must surrender the *chitōna* (inner tunic) rather than engage in a struggle for earthly fabric.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
παντι αιτουν ϲε διδου · και απο του αιροντοϲ τα ϲα μη απαιτει ·

**English Translation**
To everyone ask[ing] you, give; and from the one taking away your things, do not demand [them] back.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is absolute: *panti* (to everyone). There is no qualification of worthiness in the beggar. The scribe writes *aitoun* (asking) without the dative ending, yet the imperative *didou* (give) stands firm. More radical is the command regarding theft or seizure: *mē apaitei* (do not ask back). The believer must hold possessions so loosely that their removal by force or request is met with the same open hand.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
και καθωϲ θελετε ϊ ποιωϲιν ϋμιν οι ανθρωποι και ποιειται αυ ομοιωϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And just as you wish t[hat] men should do to you, do also to th[em] likewise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The abbreviation *i* stands for *hina* (that), acting as the fulcrum of this reciprocity. This is the law of empathy. The text uses *poieite* (do ye) regarding our action towards *autois* (them, abbreviated *au*). We are not to wait for men to treat us well; we must initiate the good we desire, making our own longings the standard for our conduct towards others.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
και ει αγαπατε τουϲ α ϋμαϲ ποια ϋμιν χαριϲ ε εϲτιν και γαρ οι α τουϲ α αυτουϲ αγαπωϲιν

**English Translation**
And if you love those l[oving] you, what grace is is it to you? For even the s[inners] love those l[oving] them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe heavily abbreviates here, using *tous a* for "those loving" and *hoi a* for "the sinners" (*hamartōloi*). This visual compression equates the "loving" of the world with the "sinners." The double *e estin* (is is) emphasizes the question: Where is the *charis* (grace)? Reciprocal love is nature, not grace. To love only those who return it is a circle of selfishness that even the ungodly inhabit.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και γαρ εαν αγαθο τουϲ αγαθο ϋμαϲ ποια ϋμιν χαριϲ ε εϲτιν και οι αμαρτω το αυτο ποιουϲ

**English Translation**
For even if you do go[od] to those doing go[od] to you, what grace is is it to you? Even the sinner[s] do the same.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is rough, with *agatho* standing for the verb *agathopoiēte* (do good). The argument advances from affection to action. If our beneficence is merely a repayment for benefits received, it is a transaction, not a virtue. The manuscript notes that *hoi amartō* (the sinners) accomplish this *to auto* (the same). The Christian must exceed the moral capacity of the sinner; otherwise, our salt has lost its savor.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
και εαν δανιϲηται παρ ων ελπιζεται λαβιν ποια ϋμιν χαριϲ εϲτιν και α αμαρ δανιζουϲ ϊνα απολαβωϲιν τα ειϲα

**English Translation**
And if you lend from whom you hope to receive, what grace is it to you? Even s[inners] lend to sinners that they might receive back the equ[al amounts].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The economic ethic of the Kingdom is laid bare. *Danisētai* (lend) is contrasted with *elpisete* (hope). The stuttering *a amar* again marks the sinners. They lend to receive *ta eisa* (the equal things/amounts). If we lend only when the return of capital is guaranteed, we act as bankers of this age, not stewards of the next. True charity risks the loss of the principal for the sake of the brother.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
πλην αγαπαται τουϲ εχθρουϲ ϋμων και αγαθοποιει και δανιζεται μηδενα απελπι και εϲται ο μιϲθοϲ ϋμων πολυϲ εν τοιϲ ο και εϲεϲθαι ϋϊοι ϋψιϲτου οτι αυτοϲ χρηϲτοϲ ε επι τουϲ αχα και πονη

**English Translation**
But love your enemies, and do good, and lend expecting nothing back; and your reward shall be great in the [heavens?], and you shall be sons of the Most High, because He is kind to the ungra[teful] and evi[l].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A majestic summary, despite the scribe's cryptic *en tois o* (likely "in the heavens," *ouranois*, though the text is truncated). The command *mēdena apelpi* (despairing of nothing, or expecting nothing back) defines the Christian loan. The motivation is theological: *Imitatio Dei*. We must be kind because *Autos* (He) is kind (*chrēstos*) even to the *acha* (*acharistous* - ungrateful) and *ponē* (*ponērous* - evil). Our sonship depends on our likeness to the Father's indiscriminate mercy.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
γεινεϲθε οικτιρ καθωϲ ο πατηρ ϋμων οι εϲτιν ο ουρανιοϲ

**English Translation**
Become merci[ful] just as your Father is mer[ciful], the Heavenly One.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex reads *geinesthe* (become ye), a process of transformation. The word *oiktir* is cut short, but signifies the deep, visceral compassion of God. The text includes a reading specific to this tradition: *o ouranios* (the Heavenly One), explicitly identifying the Father's nature. We are to mirror the heaven-nature on earth. The clumsy grammar *oi estin* (which/who is) points to the reality that mercy is not just what God does, but what He *is*.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
και μη κρινετε και ου μη κριθητε και μη καταδικαζε και ου μη κατα απολυεται και απο

**English Translation**
And do not judge and you shall certainly not be judged; and do not condemn and you shall certainly not [be condemned]; release and [you shall be released].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s struggle with the divine law of reciprocity. The text is fractured: *καταδικαζε* stands as a singular imperative or a truncated form, while *κρινετε* is plural. More striking is the sequence *και ου μη κατα απολυεται*. The scribe begins the word for condemnation (*κατα*), halts, and immediately writes *απολυεται* (release). It is as if the very pen refuses to complete the sentence of judgment, rushing instead to the command of mercy. The final *απο* hangs suspended, a promise of release cut short, awaiting the believer's action to complete it.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
διδοται και δοθηϲε ϋμιν μετρον καλον πεπιαϲμε πεπιεϲμενον ϲεϲαλευμεν ϋπερεκχυννομε δωϲουϲιν ειϲ τον κολπον ω γαρ μετρω με αντιμετρη ϋμιν

**English Translation**
Give and it shall be given to you; a good measure, [pressed] pressed down, shaken, overflowing, they shall give into the bosom; for with which measure you measure [it shall be] measured back to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The abundance of God is mirrored in the scribe's self-correction. He writes *πεπιαϲμε*, realizes the word is not full enough, and writes again *πεπιεϲμενον* (pressed down). The grain is packed tight. The *κολπον* refers to the fold of the robe used as a pocket; the blessing is not abstract but poured into the very garment of our humanity. The passive *δοθηϲε* (it shall be given) implies God as the giver, yet the plural *δωϲουϲιν* (they shall give) suggests the angels or the ministers of grace returning the gift.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε και παρα αυτοιϲ μη δυναται τυφλοϲ τυφλον οδηγειν ουκ αμφοτεροι ειϲ βοθυνον πεϲο

**English Translation**
And he spoke also a [parable] to them: Is a blind man able to guide a blind man? Will not both fall into a pit?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word *παρα* is cut short, just as a parable conceals truth from the dull of heart. The query *μη δυναται* (is he able?) expects a negative answer. Without the light of Christ (*φως*), leadership is merely mutual destruction. *βοθυνον* is the ditch of perdition. The truncation *πεϲο* (fall) leaves the disastrous action incomplete on the page, yet inevitable in reality for those without sight.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ουκ εϲτιν μαθη ϋπερ τον δι κατηρ δε εϲτω ωϲ ο διδαϲκαλοϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
A [disciple] is not above the [teacher]; but [everyone] perfected let him be as his teacher.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hierarchy of grace is absolute. The scribe abbreviates *μαθητης* to *μαθη* and *διδασκαλον* to *δι*, yet the relationship remains. The term *κατηρ* (for *κατηρτισμενος*) implies mending, restoration, or fitting together completely. We are not called merely to learn, but to be *mended* into the image of the Master. If the Master suffered, the mended disciple (*κατηρ*) must not expect ease.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
τι δε βλεπειϲ το καρ το εν τω οφθαλ του αδελφου ϲου την δε δοκον την εν τω ϊδιω ο ου κατα ˙

**English Translation**
And why do you look at the [speck] that is in the [eye] of your brother, but the beam that is in your own [eye] you do not [perceive]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is riddled with the debris of abbreviation (*καρ*, *οφθαλ*, *ο*), mimicking the obscured vision described. *Καρ* represents *καρφος*, a dry stalk or piece of chaff. The *δοκον* is the main bearing-beam of a roof. The contrast is between a piece of dust and a structural timber. The final *κατα* (for *κατανοεις*) suggests the mind's failure to "grasp down" or fully comprehend its own massive structural failure while obsessing over a neighbor's dust.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
πωϲ δε δυ λεγειν τω αδελφω ϲου αδελ αφεϲ εκβαλω το καρφοϲ το εν τω οφθαλμω ϲου αυτοϲ την εν τω ο ϲου δοκ ου βλεπων ϋποκριτα εκβαλε πρωτον την δο εκ του οφθαλ ϲου και τοτε διαβλεψειϲ εκβα το καρφοϲ το εν τω οφθαλμω του αδελφου ϲου

**English Translation**
And how are you [able] to say to your brother, 'Brother, allow [that] I might cast out the speck that is in your eye,' yourself not seeing the [beam] in your [eye]? Hypocrite, cast out first the [beam] from your [eye], and then you shall see clearly to [cast out] the speck that is in the eye of your brother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the command *εκβαλε* (cast out!) is felt in the hurried script. The Lord addresses the *ϋποκριτα* (hypocrite/actor). Note the progression: one cannot merely *βλεπω* (see) to help a brother; one must *διαβλεψειϲ* (see through/see clearly). Clear vision is the reward of repentance. Until the *δο* (beam) is removed, our attempts to heal are merely theatrical hypocrisy.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
ου γαρ εϲτιν δεν καλον ποιο καρπον ϲαπρον ουδε παλιν δεν ϲαπρον ποι καρπον καλ

**English Translation**
For there is not a good [tree] [making] rotten fruit, nor again a rotten [tree] [making] good fruit.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ontology precedes morality. A tree (*δεν*) acts according to its nature. *Σαπρον* indicates that which is crumbling, putrid, or unsound. The abbreviated *ποι* (making) emphasizes the continuous generation of works. If the fruit is rotten, do not blame the fruit; look to the root and the nature of the tree.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
εκαϲτον γαρ δεν εκ του ϊδιου καρπου γεινωϲκε · ου γαρ εξ ακαν ϲυνλεγου ϲυκα ουδε εκ βλαϲτου βατου βατου ϲταφυλ τρυγωϲιν

**English Translation**
For each [tree] is known by its own fruit; for they do not gather figs from [thorns], nor do they harvest [grapes] from a sprout of a bramble bush.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stutters with *βατου βατου* (bramble bramble), inadvertently emphasizing the tangled, repetitive nature of the thicket. One cannot extract the sweet wine of the grape (*ϲταφυλ*) from the sharp nature of the thorn. Knowledge (*γεινωϲκε*) is derived from the evidence of production, not the claims of the leaves.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
ο αγαθοϲ ανθρω εκ του αγαθου θηϲαυρου τηϲ καρ προφερει το αγαθον και ο πο εκ του πο προφερει το πονηρον εκ γαρ περιϲϲευμα καρδιαϲ το ϲτο αυτου λαλει

**English Translation**
The good [man] out of the good treasure of the [heart] brings forth the good; and the [evil] out of the [evil] brings forth the evil; for out of an abundance of heart his [mouth] speaks.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The human heart (*καρ*) is a *θηϲαυρου* (treasury). We are hoarders of either grace or malice. The scribe reduces the evil man to merely *ο πο* and his treasure to *του πο*, shrinking the dignity of evil to a mere syllable, while *αγαθον* is written more fully. Speech is the *περιϲϲευμα*—the spillover, the surplus. What the mouth (*ϲτο*) speaks is what the heart can no longer contain.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
τι δε με καλειται και ου ποιει α λεγω

**English Translation**
And why do you call me and do not do what I say?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying brevity. In this manuscript, the double invocation "Lord, Lord" (Κύριε Κύριε) is absent, leaving only the bare verb *καλειται* (you call). It strips the verse of its liturgical decoration and leaves the raw accusation: You call upon Me, but there is no *ποιει* (doing). The disconnect between lip and life is the essence of judgment.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
παϲ ο ερχομενοϲ προϲ με και ακου μου των λο μου και ποι αυτουϲ ϋπο ϋμιν τινι εϲτιν ομοιοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Everyone coming to me and [hearing] my [words] and [doing] them, I will [show] you to whom he is like.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The triad of salvation: Coming (*ερχομενοϲ*), Hearing (*ακου*), Doing (*ποι*). To miss one is to fail all. The truncated *ϋπο* (for *υποδειξω*) serves as a finger pointing downward, directing the reader to the foundation in the final verse. The Lord does not merely describe; He demonstrates (*show*) the reality of the faithful soul.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
ομοιοϲ εϲτιν αν οικοδο οικιαν οϲ εϲκαψεν και ε και εθη θεμελιον επι την πετραν πλημμυρηϲ δε γε προϲ προϲερρηξεν ο ποτα τη οικια εκι και ουκ ϊϲχυ ϲαλευϲαι αυ δια το καλωϲ οικοδομηϲθαι αυτην ·

**English Translation**
He is like a [man] [building] a house, who dug and [deepened] and placed a foundation upon the rock; and a flood [having happened], the [river] broke against [that] house and did not have strength to shake [it] because of its having been built well.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers at the crucial labor: *και ε και εθη*. The *και ε* is the vestige of *εβαθυνεν* (deepened). The digging is difficult; the scribe hesitates. But the foundation is laid on *την πετραν* (the rock/Petra). The assault of the river is violent, indicated by the double *προϲ προϲερρηξεν* (broke against/burst upon), mimicking the repeated crashing of waves. The house stands not because of its appearance, but because of what is hidden underground: the depth of the digging and the solidity of the Rock, which is Christ.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ακουϲαϲ και μη ποιηϲαϲ ομοι εϲτιν α οι οικιαν επι την γην χωριϲ θε η προϲερ ο ποταμοϲ και ευθυϲ ϲυνεπε και εγενετο το ρηγμα τηϲ οι εκεινηϲ με

**English Translation**
But the one hearing and not doing is like a man building a house upon the earth without a foundation, against which the river dashed, and immediately it fell together, and the ruin of that house became great.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here stands the terrifying conclusion of the Lord’s sermon, the warning against the barrenness of mere intellect without obedience. The text reads *akousas kai me poiesas* (hearing and not doing); observe that the failure is not in the hearing—for the word was received—but in the absence of labor. He is likened to a man (*a[nthropo]*) building (*oi[kodomesanti]*) upon the earth (*epi ten gen*), not upon the rock. The Codex abbreviates the fatal flaw: *choris the[meliou]* (without foundation). A structure built on the loose soil of worldly wisdom or fleshly inclination cannot stand the torrent.

When the river dashed against it (*proser[rexen]*), the collapse was immediate (*euthus sunepe[sen]*). There was no struggle, no endurance, for there was no substance beneath the visible walls. The final verdict is heavy: *to regma... me[ga]* (the ruin... great). This "ruin" (*regma*) signifies a breaking, a fracture that cannot be healed. Let us fear this great fall, brethren, and ensure that our confession of Christ is mortared with the deeds of charity and the discipline of the commandments, lest we be found standing on nothing but dust when the waters rise.
