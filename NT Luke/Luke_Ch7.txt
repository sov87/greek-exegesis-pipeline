**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
επει δε επληρωϲ επληρωϲ παντα τα ρηματα αυτου ειϲ ταϲ ακοαϲ του λαου ειϲηλθεν ειϲ καφαρναουμʼ ·

**English Translation**
And when he fulfilled [he fulfilled] all the sayings of him into the hearings of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the scribal hand trembles, writing *epleros* (he fulfilled) twice. Is this mere error? Or does the Spirit testify that the Lord not only finished His sermon but *filled to the brim* the vessels of their ears? The text says He spoke *eis tas akoas* (into the hearings/ears). The Word must first penetrate the hearing of the multitude before the Person enters the city of Capernaum. The teaching precedes the presence; the ear is the gateway to the heart, just as Capernaum is the gateway to His ministry of power.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
εκατονταρχου δε τινοϲ δουλοϲ κακωϲ εχων ημελ τελευταν ο ην οϲ ῆν αυτω εντιμοϲ

**English Translation**
Now a certain centurion's slave, having it badly [being sick], was about to die, who was [who was] to him honored.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we see the subversion of the world's order. A Roman *hekatontarchos* (ruler of a hundred) values a *doulos* (slave). The text stammers *os en os en* (who was, who was), as if struggling to define the relationship. This slave was *entimos* (honored/precious) to him. In the economy of Rome, a sick slave is refuse; in the economy of Grace, which this Gentile unwittingly mimics, the lowly are precious. The sickness is unto death (`τελευταν`), setting the stage for the Lord of Life.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε περι του απεϲτιλεν προϲ αυτον πρε των ϊουδαιων ερωτ αυτον οπωϲ αυ ελθων διαϲω τον δουλον > αυτου ˙

**English Translation**
And having heard concerning the [Jesus], he sent to him eld[ers] of the Jews, ask[ing] him so that he com[ing] might save the slave of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Gentile does not presume to approach the Holy One directly. He sends the *pre[sbyterous]* (elders) of the Jews. Note the verb `διαϲω` (diaso[se]). He does not merely ask for healing (*iaomai*), but to be *saved through and through*. The text is abbreviated, breathless—`ερωτ` for asking, `αυ` for he. It conveys the urgency of a dying breath. The wall of partition begins to crumble as Jewish elders carry a Gentile's prayer.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
οι δε παραγενομε προϲ τον ηρωτων αυτον ϲπουδαιωϲ λεγ λεγ οτι αξιοϲ εϲτ εϲτ ω παρεξη τουτο

**English Translation**
And the [ones] arriv[ing] to the [Jesus] were asking him earnestly, say[ing] [saying] that worthy he is [he is] to whom you should provide this;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the repetition in the Codex: `λεγ λεγ` (saying saying) and `εϲτ εϲτ` (he is he is). The elders are emphatic about human merit. They plead *axios estin*—he is worthy! They base their intercession on what the man *is* and what he has *done*. They stutter in their eagerness to prove merit, unaware that Grace flows not to the worthy, but to the needy. They say "he is worthy"; soon the man himself will say "I am not worthy."

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
α γαρ το εθνοϲ ημων και την ϲυναγωγην αυ ωκοδομηϲεν ημιν

**English Translation**
[He loves] for the nation of us, and the synagogue he [himself] built for us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads `α γαρ` (likely for *agapa*, he loves). Their proof of his worthiness is brick and mortar: `ωκοδομηϲεν` (he built). They point to the stone structure of the synagogue as the price of a miracle. How foolish! They think the Builder of the Cosmos is impressed by a building made with hands. They barter with God: "He gave us a synagogue, so You give him a life."

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ο δε επορευετο ϲυν αυτοιϲ ηδη δε αυτου ου μακραν απεχοντοϲ τηϲ οικιαϲ επεμψεν προϲ αυτον φιλουϲ ο εκατον λεγων αυτω μη ϲκυλλου ου γαρ ϊκανοϲ μι ειμι ειμι ϊνα μου ϋπο την ϲτε ειϲελθηϲ

**English Translation**
And the [Jesus] was journeying with them. But already him being not far distant from the house, the centur[ion] sent friends to him, saying to him: Do not trouble yourself; for not sufficient [me I am I am] that under the ro[of] of me you might enter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The humility of the Gentile shames the pride of the elders. The scribe writes `μι ειμι ειμι`—a profound stutter: "me I am I am." It is as if the Centurion's soul trembles before the I AM of God. He confesses `ου ϊκανοϲ` (not sufficient/worthy). He forbids the Lord to come under his *stegen* (roof), recognizing that the Creator cannot be contained by the dwelling of a sinful soldier.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
δι ουδε εμαυτον ηξιωϲα προϲ ϲε ελθει ελθειν ελθειν αλλ ειπε λο και ϊαθηϲεται ο παιϲ μου ·

**English Translation**
Wherefore neither myself did I count worthy to you to co[me] [to come] [to come]; but speak by a wo[rd], and healed shall be the boy of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Three times the text cries out `ελθει ελθειν ελθειν` (to come, to come, to come). The distance is emphasized by this repetition. He did not dare to come physically, yet by faith, he has approached closer than the Apostles. He asks only for a `λο` (Logos/Word). He understands that the authority of Christ is not spatial but essential. A mere word from the Word suffices to heal the `παιϲ` (child/servant).

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και γαρ εγω α α ειμι ϋπο εξουϲι ταϲϲομενοϲ εχων ϋπ εμαυτ εμαυτ ϲτρατιωταϲ και λεγω τουτω πο και πο και αλλω ερχου και ερχεται και τω δουλω μ(ου) ποιηϲον τουτο και ποιει

**English Translation**
For even I a m[an] [man] am under authori[ty] being set, having under myse[lf] [myself] soldiers, and I say to this one: G[o] [and go], and he goes; and to another: Come, and he comes; and to the slave of m[e]: Do this, and he does.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Centurion argues from the lesser to the greater. The manuscript reads `εγω α α` (I, man man)—emphasizing his frailty. If he, a mere man (`α` for *anthropos*), commands obedience through the hierarchy of Rome, how much more the Lord of Hosts? The scribal dittography `πο και πο` (go and go) captures the immediacy of military command. He recognizes Jesus not as a healer, but as a Commander (`Imperator`) over the forces of nature and disease.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ταυτα ο εθαυμαϲεν αυτον και ϲτρα τω ακολου αυτω ο ειπεν λεγω ϋμιν ουδε εν τω ι τοϲαυτην πι ευρον

**English Translation**
And having heard these things the [Jesus] marveled at him, and turn[ing] to the following him [crowd] he said: I say to you, not even in the I[srael] so great fai[th] did I find.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ marvels (`εθαυμαϲεν`). Only twice do we read of the Lord marveling: once at unbelief, and here at faith. He turns (`ϲτρα`) his back on the house to face the crowd. The verdict is searing: `εν τω ι` (in the Israel) He found no such `πι` (faith). The custodians of the Law lack what the stranger possesses. The Kingdom is being taken from the children of the household and given to those outside the gate.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και ϋποϲτρεψαντεϲ ειϲ τον οικον οι πεμφθεντεϲ ευ τον δουλον ϋγιαινοντα

**English Translation**
And having returned into the house, the ones having been sent fou[nd] the slave being healthy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The return brings confirmation. `ευ` (they found) the slave `ϋγιαινοντα` (being healthy/whole). There was no touch, no shadow cast, only the invisible trajectory of the Almighty Will. The healing occurred at the moment of the Word. The servant lives because the Master commanded.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τη τω εξηϲ επορευ ειϲ πολιν καλουμενην να και ϲυνεπορευ αυτω οι μα αυτου και οχλοϲ πολυϲ

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in the [time] next, he was journey[ing] into a city being called Na[in]; and were journeying with him the disci[ples] of him and a crowd much.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scene shifts from Capernaum to `να` (Nain). A great company moves with Him—His `μα` (disciples) and a `οχλοϲ πολυϲ` (much crowd). This is the procession of Life. They march unwittingly toward a confrontation with the procession of Death. The geography serves the theology: He moves from healing the sick (who is absent) to raising the dead (who is present).

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ δε ηγγιϲεν τη πυ τηϲ πολεωϲ και ϊδου εξεκο τεθνη μονογενηϲ τη μητρι αυτου και αυτη ην χη και οχλοϲ τηϲ πολεωϲ ϊκανοϲ ην ϲυν αυτη

**English Translation**
And as he drew near to the ga[te] of the city, and behold, was being carried o[ut] a dead one, only-born to the mother of him, and she was a wid[ow]; and a crowd of the city considerable was with her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
At the `πυ` (gate), two crowds collide. One enters with the Prince of Life; one exits with a corpse. The dead man is `μονογενηϲ` (only-begotten), a title that belongs properly to the One who meets him. The mother is a `χη` (widow)—bereft of husband and now of son, a type of Zion desolate. She has a "considerable crowd" with her, but they can only weep; they cannot help. The Only-Begotten Son of God meets the only-begotten son of the widow. Death claims the latter; Life claims the former.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδων αυτην ο εϲπλαγχνιϲθη επ αυτην · και ει αυτη μη κλαι

**English Translation**
And seeing her, he was moved with compassion for her; and said to her, Do not weep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the divine economy of mercy. The text reads simply *o* (he), omitting the *Nomina Sacra* for "Lord" often found here, yet the action reveals the divinity. He sees, and immediately the bowels of compassion (*esplanchnisthē*) are stirred. He commands "Do not weep," not as a prohibition of grief, but as a prelude to the joy that is to conquer death. He speaks to the living mother before addressing the dead son, for the miracle is as much for the consolation of the Church (the mother) as for the raising of the individual.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων ηψατο τηϲ ϲορου οι δε βαϲταζοντεϲ εϲτηϲαν και ει νεανιϲκε ϲοι λεγω εγερθητι

**English Translation**
And approaching, he touched the bier; and the bearers stood still. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, arise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Law of Moses declares that he who touches the dead is unclean, yet the Source of Life touches the bier (*sorou*) and is not defiled; rather, the unclean is sanctified. The bearers halt, arrested by the authority of the Word. The command is direct: *soi legō* (I say to thee). He does not pray for power as Elijah did; He commands by His own authority, *egerthēti* (be raised), demonstrating that He is the Resurrection.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και ανεκαθιϲεν ο νεκροϲ και ηρ λαλιν και ε αυτον τη μητρι αυτου

**English Translation**
And the dead man sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates *ērxato* to *hēr* and *edōken* to *e*, rushing to record the miracle. The proofs of life are twofold: movement ("sat up") and speech ("to speak"). A corpse may be moved by others, but speech requires the breath of spirit. "He gave him to his mother" mirrors the act of Elijah, yet here it signifies Christ restoring the faithful to the bosom of the Church. The separation caused by death is bridged by the Word.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ελαβεν δε φοβοϲ απανταϲ και εδο τον λε οτι προ μεγαϲ ηγερ εν ημιν και οτι επεϲκεψατο ο τον λαον αυτου

**English Translation**
And fear seized all; and they glorified [God], saying that a great prophet has been raised among us, and that [God] has visited his people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is heavily contracted (*edo* for *edoxazon*, *pro* for *prophētēs*), reflecting the urgency of the acclamation. The crowd perceives a "great prophet," recognizing the prophetic type of resurrection, yet they do not yet fully grasp the Sonship. They confess that God (*o*, likely implying *o theos*) has "visited" (*epeskepsato*) His people, a term of episcopal oversight and divine intervention.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και εξηλθεν ο λο ουτοϲ εν ολη τη ϊουδαια περι αυτου περι αυτου και πα τη περιχωρω

**English Translation**
And this word went out in the whole of Judea concerning him concerning him, and in all the surrounding region.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript exhibits a dittography here, repeating *peri autou* (concerning him). While a scribal redundancy, spiritually it doubles the emphasis: the report was entirely about *Him*. The "word" (*logos*) here is the report of the miracle, spreading from the center of Judea to the *perichōrō* (surrounding country), prefiguring the expansion of the Gospel to the Gentiles.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και απηγγιλαν ϊ οι μαθη αυτου περι παν τουτων και προϲκαλεϲα δυο τιναϲ των μαθητων αυτου ο ϊωαννηϲ

**English Translation**
And his disciples reported to John concerning all these things. And calling to him certain two of his disciples, John...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The news reaches the Forerunner. The scribe uses *i* (iota) likely for *Iōannē* (to John) before writing the name fully later. John summons two disciples—witnesses required by the Law—to bridge the old dispensation with the new. He does not doubt, but seeks to transfer their allegiance to the Bridegroom.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
επεμψεν προϲ τ λεγων ϲυ ει ο ερχομενοϲ η ετε προϲδοκωμ

**English Translation**
...sent [them] to the [Lord], saying, Art thou the coming one, or do we look for another?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The destination is abbreviated *pros t* (likely *ton kyrion*, the Lord). The question strikes at the heart of Messianic expectation: *Sy ei* (Art thou?). "The Coming One" is a title of the Christ. The abbreviation *eter* for *eteron* (another) and *prosdokōm* for *prosdokōmen* (look for) suggests the commonality of this theological query. John asks for the sake of his disciples, that they might hear the answer from the Truth Himself.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
παραγενομενοι δε οι ανδρεϲ προϲ αυτον ει ϊωαννηϲ ο βαπτιϲτηϲ απε ημαϲ προϲ ϲε λεγων ϲυ ει ο ερ η ετερ προϲδοκωμεν

**English Translation**
And having arrived to him, the men said, John the Baptist has sent us to thee, saying, Art thou the coming [one] or do we look for another?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The messengers repeat the question verbatim, acting as faithful mouthpieces of the Baptist. The text abbreviates *er* for *erchomenos* (coming). They stand before the Incarnate Word asking if He is the Word to come. It is a moment of confrontation between the prophecy and the fulfillment.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
εν εκεινη τη ημε ωρα εθεραπευϲεν πολλουϲ απο νο και μαϲτι και π π ακαθαρτων πονηρων και τυφλοιϲ πολλοιϲ εχαριϲατο το βλεπε βλεπε

**English Translation**
In that day [hour], he healed many from diseases and scourges and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted to see [to see].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A rich textual variant appears: *ēme* (day) is written but *ōra* (hour) follows, perhaps a correction indicating the immediacy of the miracles—in that very hour! The scribe stutters in awe or error: *p p* for *pneumatōn* (spirits) and *blepe blepe* (to see to see). Theologically, this repetition emphasizes the abundance of grace; sight is given upon sight. He answers not with arguments, but with power over *mastigōn* (scourges).

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ει αυτοιϲ πορευ απαγγι ϊωαννει α ει και ηκουϲατε ‾‾ τυφλοι αναβλεπουϲ αναβλεπουϲ χωλοι περιπατουϲ περιπατουϲ λεπροι καθαριζονται και κωφοι ακουουϲ ακουουϲ νεκροι εγειρονται και πτωχοι ευαγ

**English Translation**
And answering he said to them, Going, report to John what things you saw and heard: blind receive sight [receive sight], lame walk [walk], lepers are cleansed, and deaf hear [hear], dead are raised, and poor are evangelized.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord lists the signs of Isaiah 35 and 61. The manuscript here is filled with dittographies: *anablepous anablepous* (receive sight), *peripatous peripatous* (walk), *akouous akouous* (hear). Whether by scribal hand or intent, the doubling confirms the certainty of the signs. The final sign is the greatest: *ptōchoi euag* (the poor are evangelized). Miracles of the body serve the miracle of the soul—the reception of the Good News.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και μα εϲτιν οϲ μη ϲκανδαλιϲθη εν εμοι

**English Translation**
And blessed is whoever is not offended in me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The beatitude (*ma* for *makarios*) is a warning. The humility of the Incarnation, the lack of political conquest, is a *skandalon* (stumbling block) to those expecting a worldly king. Blessed is the one who sees the "blind seeing" and the "dead raised" and recognizes the finger of God, not demanding a Messiah of their own making.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
απελθοντων δε τ αγγελων ηρξατο λεγειν τοιϲ οχλοιϲ προϲ τουϲ οχλουϲ περι ϊω ϊω τι εξηλθαται ειϲ την ερημον θεαϲαϲθε καλα ϋπο ανεμου ϲαλευομενον

**English Translation**
And the messengers having departed, he began to say to the crowds [toward the crowds] concerning John [John]: What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As the messengers leave, Jesus defends John to the multitude. The text contains a conflation: *tois ochlois pros tous ochlous* (to the crowds toward the crowds), and a repetition of the name *Iō Iō* (John John). He contrasts John with a reed (*kala* for *kalamon*) shaken by the wind. John is no wavering reed; he is the firm oak of the desert, unshaken by Herod’s prison or public opinion, the steadfast witness to the Truth.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
αλλα τι εξηλθαται ϊδειν ανθρωπον εν μαλακοιϲ ϊμα ημφιεϲμε οι εν ι ενδο και τρυφη ϋ εν τοιϲ βαϲιλειοιϲ ει

**English Translation**
But what did you go out to see? A man in soft garments dressed? Those in glorious [clothing] and luxury exist in the palaces.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the stark dichotomy drawn by the Lord. He contrasts the rugged asceticism of the wilderness with the effeminacy of the court. The "softness" (*malakois*) of the garments signifies a soul enervated by worldly comfort, unfit for the rigors of prophecy. Those who dwell in "palaces" (*basileiois*) seek the praise of men and the ease of the flesh; the prophet seeks the face of God in the barren places. We must not look for truth wrapped in the finery of this age.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
αλλα τι εξηλ ϊδειν προ ναι λεγω ϋμιν και περιϲ προφη

**English Translation**
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more abundant [than] a prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord confirms John’s office but immediately transcends it. John is a prophet (*propheten*), yes, for he speaks the oracles of God. Yet he is *perissoteron*—something more excessive, more abundant. The ancient prophets foresaw the Light from afar; John touches the Light with his own hands in the waters of Jordan. He is the hinge between the shadows of the Law and the reality of the Christ.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ εϲτιν περι ου γεγραπται ϊδου αποϲτελλω τον αγγελον μου προ προϲωπου ϲου οϲ καταϲκευ την οδον ϲου εμπροϲθεν ϲου

**English Translation**
This is [he] concerning whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Master applies the prophecy of Malachi directly to the Forerunner. Note the term *aggelon* (messenger/angel); John acts in the capacity of a divine herald. The "preparation of the way" is the leveling of the mountains of pride and the filling of the valleys of despair within the human heart. The messenger goes "before the face" (*pro prosopou*), indicating the immediate proximity of the King.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν μειζων εν γεν γεννητοιϲ γεννητοιϲ γυναικων ϊωαννου ουδειϲ εϲτιν ο δε μεικρο εν τη βαϲι του μει αυτου εϲτιν

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, greater among those born of women than John no one is; but the lesser in the kingdom of God [is] greater than he.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery of the Dispensation. John is the summit of the old creation, the greatest of those born merely of natural descent (*gennetois gynaikon*). Yet, the "lesser" (*mikroteros*)—the one who is least in the Kingdom—possesses a dignity that surpasses him. Why? Because the Kingdom confers adoption as sons of God through water and the Spirit. To be a servant of the Word is great; to be a child of the Father is greater.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και παϲ ο λαοϲ ακου και οι τελω εδικαιωϲαν τον βαπτιϲθ το βαπτιϲμα ϊ

**English Translation**
And all the people hearing and the tax collectors justified [God], having been baptized with the baptism of John.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See who accepts the counsel of Heaven: the common people and the despised tax collectors (*telonai*). To "justify" (*edikaiosan*) here does not mean to make God righteous, but to acknowledge and declare His righteousness. By submitting to the baptism of repentance, they vindicated God’s judgment against their sins, admitting they were in need of the washing that the Pharisees scorned.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
οι δε φα και οι νο την βουλ βουλ του ηθετηϲαν μη βαπτιϲθεντεϲ ϋπ αυτου

**English Translation**
But the Pharisees and the lawyers the counsel of God rejected for themselves, not having been baptized by him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrible indictment. The religious elites did not merely reject a man; they nullified (*ethetesan*) the "counsel of God" (*boulen tou theou*) regarding their own salvation. Pride is the barrier to baptism. By refusing the humiliation of the Jordan, they cut themselves off from the grace intended for them. They preferred their own legal righteousness to the righteousness of God.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
τινι δε ομοιωϲω τουϲ ανθρωπουϲ τηϲ γενεαϲ ταυτηϲ και τινι ειϲιν ο

**English Translation**
To what then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord seeks a similitude (*homoioso*) for a generation that is spiritually petulant. He looks for a comparison that captures their inconsistency and obstinacy. It is the sorrow of the Physician who finds the patient refusing every cure, whether bitter or sweet.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ομοιοι ει παιδιοιϲ τοιϲ εν αγορα καθη και προϲ αλλη α λεγει λεγοντα η υμιν και ουκ ωρχηϲαϲθαι εθρηνηϲαμεν και ουκ εκλαυϲα

**English Translation**
They are like children in a marketplace sitting and to one another calling, saying: We piped to you and you did not dance; we wailed and you did not weep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The generation is likened to capricious children playing games in the *agora*. When the "wedding song" is played (the joy of the Kingdom), they refuse to dance. When the "funeral dirge" is wailed (the call to repentance), they refuse to weep. They are spiritually paralyzed, unmoved by the sweetness of grace or the terror of judgment. They dictate the terms of their religion, rather than submitting to God's movement.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
εληλυθεν γαρ ϊωαννηϲ ο βα μη εϲ αρτον μη πινων οιν και λεγεται δαι εχει

**English Translation**
For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say: He has a demon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John came in the way of the dirge: fasting, asceticism, and severity. The world, unable to comprehend such self-denial, dismisses it as madness or demonic possession (*daimonion echei*). The holy restraint of the flesh is hateful to those who worship their bellies. They slander what they cannot imitate.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ελη ο του αν εϲθι εϲθι και πινων και λε ϊδου ανθρω φαγοϲ και οι φιλοϲ τελωνων και α

**English Translation**
The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say: Behold, a man [who is] a glutton and wine-drinker, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Son came in the way of the flute: bringing joy, communion, and sanctifying the table. Yet, malice finds a way to condemn this too. They call the Holy One a "glutton" (*phagos*) and a "wine-drinker" (*oinopotes*). Note the title they hurl as an insult: "Friend of tax collectors." They meant it as shame; He wears it as a crown of mercy. He descends to the sinners not to join their sin, but to lift them to His holiness.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και εδικαιωθη η ϲο απο παντ των εργων αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And wisdom was justified by all her works.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Attend carefully to the reading of the Codex: *ergon* (works), not *teknon* (children). Divine Wisdom is vindicated by Her *deeds*. Whether through the fasting of John or the feasting of Jesus, the works of God accomplish the salvation of the elect. The method varies, but the work—the redemption of man—remains the proof of God's wisdom. The results speak against the slanderers.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ηρωτα δε τιϲ αυτ αυτ των φαριϲαιων ϊνα φαγη μετ αυ και ειϲελθ ειϲελθ ειϲ τον οικον του φαριϲαιου κατεκει κατεκλιθη

**English Translation**
Now one of the Pharisees asked him that he might eat with him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee, he reclined [to eat].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Despite the hostility of the Pharisees mentioned earlier, the Lord does not refuse this invitation. He enters the house of the legalist, demonstrating that His offer of friendship extends even to the proud. He "reclined" (*kateklithe*), taking the posture of a formal banquet. He makes Himself vulnerable to their scrutiny, preparing the stage for a demonstration of love that will shatter their rigid categories.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου γυνη ητιϲ ην εν τη πολει α και ε οτι κα εν τη οι του φαριϲαιου κομιϲαϲα αλαβα μυρου

**English Translation**
And behold, a woman who was in the city, a [sinner], and [knowing] that [he lies] in the house of the Pharisee, having brought an alabaster of myrrh.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the boldness of repentance. The text designates her location "in the city" (*en te polei*), marking her as a public figure of shame, yet she invades the private sanctity of the Pharisee’s house (*oikia*). The abbreviated text in the Codex (`α` for *hamartolos*/sinner, `ε` for *epignousa*/knowing, `κα` for *katakeitai*/reclining) suggests the scribe’s haste or the familiarity of the account, yet the essentials remain: the sinner, the knowledge of Christ’s presence, and the offering. She brings the *alabastron*, a vessel sealed for a singular purpose, indicating that her repentance is not impulsive but prepared.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και ϲταϲα οπιϲω πα τουϲ ποδαϲ αυτου κλαιουϲα τοιϲ δα ηρξατο βρε τουϲ ποδαϲ αυτου και ταιϲ θρι τηϲ κεφαληϲ αυτηϲ εξεμαξεν εξεμαϲϲεν και κατεφιλει τουϲ ποδαϲ αυτου και ηλειφεν τω μυρω

**English Translation**
And standing behind at his feet weeping, with the tears she began to wet his feet, and with the hairs of her head she wiped [wiped], and kissed his feet and anointed [them] with the myrrh.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound liturgy of humility. She stands *opiso* (behind), unworthy to face the Logos. The manuscript here reveals a struggle in the transmission: the scribe writes `εξεμαξεν` (wiped, aorist) and then `εξεμαϲϲεν` (was wiping, imperfect), preserving both the singular act and the continuous devotion. She uses her hair—the glory of a woman (1 Cor 11:15)—as a common towel (`thrixin`), thereby subjugating her vanity to the service of the Lord’s lowest part, His feet. The tears provide the water which the host neglected.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ο φαριϲαι ο καλεϲαϲ αυ ειπεν εν ε λεγων ου ει ην προφη εγεινωϲκεν αν τιϲ και ποτα η γυνη ητιϲ α αυτου οτι αμαρτωλοϲ εϲτ

**English Translation**
But seeing [this], the Pharisee who called him said within himself saying: This [man], if he were a prophet, would know who and of what sort the woman [is] who touches him, that she is a sinner.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisee judges the Judge. He speaks `en heauto` (in himself), assuming his thoughts are hidden from the Guest. His theology is flawed: he believes holiness requires separation from the unclean (`haptetai` - touches), whereas the Incarnate Word touches the unclean to make it holy. He doubts the prophetic nature (`prophetes`) of Christ precisely at the moment Christ is reading his heart, thereby proving the very prophecy he denies.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο ειπεν προϲ αυτ ϲιμων εχω ϲοι τι ειπιν ο δε διδα ειπε φηϲ

**English Translation**
And answering, the [Jesus] said to him: Simon, I have something to say to you. And he says: Teacher, speak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord answers the unspoken thought. He addresses him by name, Simon, stripping away the title of Pharisee to speak man to man. Simon responds with `didaskale` (Teacher), a title of respect that his internal monologue just contradicted. The dialogue shifts from the internal judgment of the host to the open teaching of the Guest.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
δυο χρεοφιλεται ηϲαν δανιϲτη τι ο ειϲ ωφιλεν δηναρια πεντα ο δε ετεροϲ πεντηκοντα ˙

**English Translation**
Two debtors were to a certain lender; the one owed denarii five [hundred], and the other fifty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord constructs a parable of debt (`chreopheiletai`). The Codex abbreviates the greater debt simply as `penta` (five), implying the *pentakosia* (five hundred) known to the reader. The disparity is ten to one, yet both share the ontological status of debtor. Neither can pay. This levels the ground between the "righteous" Simon and the "sinner" woman; both stand in need of a resource they do not possess.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
μη εχοντων δε αυτ αυτ αποδουναι αμφο εχαριϲατο τιϲ ουν αυτων πλει αγαπηϲει αυτ

**English Translation**
But they not having [means] to pay, he forgave both. Who therefore of them will love him more?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the economy of salvation: inability leads to grace. `Me echonton` (not having) is the prerequisite for `echarisato` (he graced/forgave). The verb *charizomai* implies a gift freely given, not a transaction. The Lord posits that love (`agapesei`) is the logical consequence of realized grace. The magnitude of love corresponds to the magnitude of the perceived debt remitted.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ϲι ειπεν ϋπο οτι ω το πλιον εχαριϲα ο δε ειπεν αυτω ορθωϲ εκριναϲ

**English Translation**
And answering Simon said: I suppose [it is he] to whom he forgave the more. And he said to him: Rightly you judged.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Simon answers with cautious reluctance, `hypolambano` (I suppose/assume), sensing the trap. He acknowledges that the one with the greater `pleion` (more) forgiveness owes the greater love. Jesus confirms his judgment (`orthos ekrinas`), forcing Simon to condemn his own lack of love by his own logic.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
και ϲτραφειϲ προϲ την γυναικα τω ϲι εφη · βλεπιϲ ταυτην την γυναι ειϲηλθον ϲου ειϲ την οικιαν ϋδωρ μου επι τουϲ πο ουκ εδωκαϲ αυτη δε τοιϲ δακρυ εβρεξεν μου τουϲ ποδαϲ και ταιϲ θριξιν αυτηϲ εξε

**English Translation**
And turning toward the woman, to Simon he said: Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; water for my feet you did not give; but she with tears wet my feet and with her hairs wiped [them].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A dramatic triangulation. Christ looks at the woman but speaks to Simon. He contrasts the negligence of the host with the extravagance of the sinner. Simon provided no water (`hydor`), a basic courtesy of the desert; the woman provided tears (`dakrysin`), the water of the heart. Simon provided no towel; she provided her hair. The Pharisee is found wanting in the very hospitality he claimed to offer.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
φιλημα μοι ουκ εδωκαϲ αυτη δε αφ ηϲ ειϲηλ ου διελειπεν καταφιλουϲα μου τουϲ ποδαϲ

**English Translation**
A kiss you did not give me; but she, from the time I entered, did not cease kissing my feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The contrast continues. The kiss (`philema`) on the cheek was the mark of peace and equality among brethren. Simon withheld it, maintaining his distance. The woman, however, offers `kataphilousa`—a compound verb indicating fervent, repeated kissing—not upon the face, but upon the feet. Her humility surpasses Simon's pride; her ceaseless devotion (`ou dieleipen`) shames his cold formality.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ελαι την κεφαλην μου ουκ ηλιψαϲ αυτη δε μυρω η μου τουϲ πο

**English Translation**
With oil my head you did not anoint; but she with myrrh anointed my feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final comparison of substance. Simon refused even common olive oil (`elaio`) for the head, a sign of gladness for a guest. The woman poured out precious myrrh (`myro`) upon the feet. The head represents authority; the feet represent the walk of the Gospel. She honors the lowest part of Christ with the highest cost, while Simon grants no honor to the Head of the Church.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ου χαριν ειπ λεγω ϲοι αφεονται αφεωνται αυ αι αμαρτιαι αι πολλαι οτι ηγαπη πολυ ω δε ο αφιεται ο αγαπα

**English Translation**
For which sake I say to you: Her sins, the many, are forgiven [forgiven], for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, [he] loves [little].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The theological climax. Her love is not the *cause* of forgiveness, but the *evidence* of it, as indicated by the parable of the debtors. The scribe again presents a double reading `αφεονται αφεωνται` (are forgiven), emphasizing the certainty of the absolution. Her sins are "many" (`pollai`), yet they are gone. The warning to Simon is stark: he who perceives his debt as `oligon` (little) loves little. Simon's lack of love proves he has not grasped the need for grace.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτη α αφεωνται ϲου αι α

**English Translation**
And he said to her: Forgiven are your [sins].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The fiat of the Son of God. He speaks directly to the woman (`aute`). The Codex text is heavily abbreviated here (`α` for *apheontai*, `α` for *hamartiai*), as if the scribe rushes to the conclusion or the parchment is worn. The declaration is absolute. It is the public ratification of what her heart already knew by faith. The Pharisee questioned if He knew she was a sinner; Christ declares she *was* a sinner, but is now justified.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
και ηρξαν οι ϲυνανακει λεγειν εν ε τιϲ ουτοϲ εϲτιν οϲ και αμαρ αφιηϲιν

**English Translation**
And those reclining together began to say within themselves: Who is this who even forgives sins?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the murmuring of the earthbound mind against the economy of heaven. The text reads *ērxan* (they began), marking the onset of a theological scandal among the *synanakeimenoi* (those reclining together). They do not speak aloud to the Lord, but *en heautois* (within themselves) or perhaps among themselves, questioning His identity. Their question, "Who is this?" strikes at the very root of the Incarnation. They recognize correctly that the forgiveness of *hamartias* (sins) belongs to God alone; yet, blinded by flesh, they fail to see God sitting at their table. They stumble over the magnitude of the mercy, for they perceive the man but miss the Authority that commands the soul's release.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ τ γυναικα η πιϲτιϲ ϲου ϲεϲωκεν ϲε πορευου ειϲ ειρη

**English Translation**
But He said to the woman: Your faith has saved you; go into peace.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord turns His face from the doubters to the penitent. He does not answer the silent accusations of the guests; instead, He confirms the salvation of the sinner. *Hē pistis sou sesōken se*—"Your faith has saved you." It is not the ointment, nor the tears, nor the touching of feet that saved her, but the internal motion of faith which these actions manifested. The verb *sesōken* stands in the perfect tense, indicating a completed act with abiding results; she is already saved. He dismisses her not into the night, but *eis eirēnēn* (into peace). This is the peace of reconciliation with God, a fortress against the judgment of men. Where the Pharisee found scandal, the woman found peace.
