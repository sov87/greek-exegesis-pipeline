**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν τω ϲυναχθηναι τον οχλον τον οχλον επικειϲθαι αυτω και ακουε τον λογον του και αυτοϲ ην εϲ παρα την λιμνην γεν ·

**English Translation**
And it happened in the gathering [of] the crowd the crowd pressing upon him and hearing the word of the [God?] and he was standing by the lake Gen[nesaret].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal hand trembling under the weight of the multitude; the scribe writes *ton ochlon* (the crowd) twice, a dittography that inadvertently emphasizes the crushing density of the masses seeking the Logos. The text is truncated at *tou*, leaving the source of the "word" implicit—it is the Word of God, though the scribe falters. He stands by the lake "Gen," the waters of Gennesaret, the boundary between the stable earth of Israel and the chaotic waters of the nations.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και ειδ δυο πλοια εϲτωτα πα την λιμνην οι δε αλεειϲ αλειειϲ απ αυτων αποβαντεϲ επλυ τα δικτυα ·

**English Translation**
And he saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen fishermen having gone away from them were washing the nets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the scribe stammers, writing *aleeis aleieis* (fishermen), doubling the laborers. Spiritually, this signifies the two peoples—Jew and Gentile—weary from the night of the Law where no catch was taken. They wash their nets (*eply*), a sign of resignation and the cessation of effort. The Lord finds them in their failure, not their success.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
εμβαϲ δε ειϲ εν των πλοιων ο ϲιμωνοϲ ηρωτη αυτον απο τηϲ γηϲ επαναγαγιν ολιγον καθιϲαϲ δε εν τω πλοιω εδι τουϲ οχλουϲ

**English Translation**
And having embarked into one of the boats, which was Simon's, he asked him to put out from the land a little; and having sat down in the boat he was teaching the crowds.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The boat of Simon becomes the *cathedra* (seat) of the Bishop of souls. Christ separates slightly from the land (*ges*) to gain perspective, yet remains anchored to it by the wood of the boat—a type of the Cross. From this floating pulpit, He teaches (*edi*), bridging the abyss between the stable shore and the deep waters.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ δε επαυϲατο λαλων ειπεν προϲ τον ϲιμωνα επα ειϲ το βαθοϲ και χαλαϲατε τα δι ϋμων ειϲ α

**English Translation**
And as he ceased speaking, he said to Simon: Launch into the deep and let down the nets of you [pl] for a [catch].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is *epa eis to bathos*—launch into the depth. We must leave the shallows of mere ethics and enter the mysteries of theology. The text is abbreviated significantly here (*di* for *diktya*, *eis a* for *eis agran*), as if the command is swift and urgent. One does not argue with the Divine command to cast into the unknown.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ει ϲιμων ϲιμων ειπεν επιϲ δι οληϲ νυκτοϲ κοπιαϲαντεϲ ου ελαβομεν ε δε τω ρηματι ϲου χαλαϲω τα δικτυα

**English Translation**
And answering said Simon Simon said: Master, through the whole night having toiled we took nothing; but at your word I will let down the nets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes "said Simon Simon," perhaps capturing the agitation of the Apostle. Simon appeals to *epistata* (Master/Overseer), acknowledging earthly authority. The "night" represents the time without Christ, full of toil (*kopiasantes*) but void of fruit. Yet, faith bridges the gap: *epi de to rhemati sou* (but on your word). It is the *rhema*, the spoken utterance of God, that fills the empty nets of human endeavor.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και τουτο ποιηϲ ϲυνεκλιϲαν πληθοϲ ϊχθυων πολυ διερρηϲϲετο δε τα δικτυα αυτ

**English Translation**
And having done this, they enclosed a multitude of fish, a great one; and the nets of them were breaking.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The result of obedience is an abundance that threatens to destroy the old vessels. The nets were breaking (*dierresseto*). The Old Covenant (the old nets) cannot contain the fullness of the Spirit poured out by Christ. The catch is *poly* (much/great), signifying the vast number of souls to be gathered into the Church.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και κατενευϲεν κατενευϲαν τοιϲ μετοχοιϲ εν τω ετερω πλοιω τουϲ του ελθονταϲ ϲ ϲ αυτοιϲ και ηλθαν και ε αμφοτε αμφοτερο̣ι̣ τα πλοια ωϲτε βυθιζεϲθαι αυτα

**English Translation**
And he beckoned [they beckoned] to the partners in the other boat to come [help] them; and they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is chaotic: *kateneusen* (singular) is corrected to *kateneusan* (plural); *tous tou* is a stutter; *s s* is a fractured attempt at *syllambanesthai* (to help/seize together). This textual chaos mirrors the panic in the sinking boats. One boat calls to the other—symbolizing the unity of the Church where the strong help the weak, yet the abundance of Grace is so heavy it threatens to submerge our mortal nature (*bythizesthai*).

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ϲιμων πετροϲ προϲε τοιϲ γονα ι λεγων εξελ απ εμου οτι ανηρ αμαρτωλοϲ ειμι

**English Translation**
And seeing [this], Simon Peter fell at the knees of J[esu]s, saying: Depart from me, for a sinful man am I.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter sees the miracle and immediately sees his own darkness. He falls at the *gona I*—the knees of Jesus (the Nomen Sacrum *I* stands for *Iesou*). The presence of the Holy One acts as a mirror to the conscience. He begs the Lord to *exel* (depart), not out of hatred, but out of holy dread (*mysterium tremendum*). He confesses he is an *aner hamartolos*, a man of sin.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
θαμβοϲ γαρ περιεϲχεν αυτουϲ αυτον και πανταϲ τουϲ ϲυ αυτω επι τη αγρα των ϊχθυων η ϲυ

**English Translation**
For astonishment encompassed them [him] and all those with him at the catch of the fish which they [took].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe corrects *autous* (them) to *auton* (him), focusing the narrative on Peter's personal crisis, though the dread (*thambos*) is shared by all. This *thambos* is the beginning of wisdom. They are stunned not merely by the fish, but by the sovereignty over nature displayed by the Carpenter's son.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ομοιωϲ δε και ϊακωβοϲ και ϊωαννηϲ οι υϊοι ζεβεδαιου οι ηϲ ηϲ κοινωνοι τω ϲι και ειπεν προϲ τον ϲιμω ο μη φοβου απο του νυν αν εϲη ζω

**English Translation**
And likewise also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And said to Simon [Jesus]: Do not fear; from now on you will be catching men alive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers *es es* (were). The Lord speaks to Simon (*Simona*), calming the dread: *Me phobou* (Fear not). The prophecy is cryptic in this abbreviated text: *an ese zo*. *An* stands for *anthropous* (men), *zo* for *zogron* (taking alive). Unlike the fish which are caught to die, the Apostolic net catches men to give them Life (*Zoe*). It is a capture for the sake of salvation.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και καταγα τα πλοια επι την γην αφ αφ παντα ηκο αυτω

**English Translation**
And having brought the boats onto the land, leaving all, they followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stutter *aph aph* (leaving/having left) emphasizes the totality of the renunciation. They bring the boats to land (*kataga*) and abandon the tools of their trade. To follow (*eko* for *ekolouthesan*) the Incarnate Word requires the abandonment of the worldly livelihood. They trade the visible catch for the invisible reward.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω ειναι αυτον εν μια των πολε και ϊδου ανηρ πλη λεπραϲ ϊδων δε τον πεϲων επι προϲωπον εδεηθη αυτου λε εαν θε δυναϲαι με καθαριϲαι

**English Translation**
And it happened in his being in one of the cities, and behold, a man full of leprosy; and seeing [Jesus], falling upon [his] face, he begged him saying: If you will, you are able to cleanse me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We move from the sea to the city (*pole*), yet the misery of man remains. The man is *ple* (full) of leprosy—sin has completely covered the image of God. He falls on his face, a posture of total submission. His theology is perfect: *ean the* (if you will) *dynasai* (you are able). He does not doubt the power (*dynamis*), only the will (*thelema*) of the Holy One to touch the unclean.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και εκτι την χειρα η ταϲ χειραϲ ηψατο αυτου εγων λεγων θελω καθαριϲθη και ευθεωϲ α η λεπρα απηλθεν α αυτου

**English Translation**
And stretching out the hand or the hands he touched him, I saying saying: I will, be cleansed; and immediately [?] the leprosy departed [?] from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the scribe's hesitation, writing "the hand or the hands" (*ten cheira e tas cheiras*), revealing a struggle to capture the physical reality of the Incarnation. Whether one hand or two, the touch of the Word is sufficient. The curious repetition "I saying saying" (*egon legon*) and the stuttering alphas around the departure of the leprosy suggest the overwhelming immediacy of the miracle, where the divine will ("I will") instantly banishes the corruption of the flesh.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ παρηγγιλεν αυτω μηδενι ειπιν αλ απελθων διξον ϲεαυτον τω ιερι κ(αι) προϲ περι του καθαριϲμου ϲου καθωϲ προϲετα μωϋϲηϲ ειϲ μαρτυριον αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And he charged him to tell no one, but departing show yourself to the priest and offer concerning your cleansing just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord enforces the Law ("just as Moses commanded") to validate the Lawgiver's authority. The command to silence is pastoral prudence, preventing the mob from mistaking the Messiah for a mere wonder-worker. The offering is a "testimony to them"—a legal proof to the priesthood that the Kingdom has arrived, leaving them without excuse when they later reject Him.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
διηρχετο δε μαλ ο λογοϲ περι αυτου και ϲυνηρχοντο οχλοι πολλοι α και θερα απο τ αϲθενιων αυτ

**English Translation**
But the word concerning him went abroad the more; and many crowds came together [?] and to be healed from their infirmities.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Despite the command for silence, the "word" (*logos*) spreads. The abbreviation of "to be healed" (*thera*) and "infirmities" (*asthenion*) in the manuscript reflects the haste of the multitudes. They gather not yet for the doctrine, but for the relief of the body; yet the Physician accepts them, using physical healing as a bait for spiritual salvation.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ δε ην ϋπο εν ταιϲ ε και προϲ

**English Translation**
But he was withdrawing [?] in the [deserts?] and praying [?].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is starkly abbreviated, almost eroding like the wilderness itself. "In the e..." (*en tais e*) surely points to *eremois* (deserts). Even the Incarnate Lord requires solitude ("hypo..." withdrawing) and communion with the Father ("pros..." praying). If the Master flees the crowds to pray, how much more must the servant seek the silence of the desert to maintain the soul's integrity?

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν μι των ημερων και αυτοϲ ην διδα και ηϲαν καθημενοι φαρι και νομο οι ηϲαν εληλυθοτεϲ εκ πα κωμηϲ τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ και ϊου και ϊερουϲα και δυναμιϲ ην ειϲ το ϊαϲθαι αυτον

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in one [of] the days, and he was teaching, and there were sitting Pharisees and teachers of the law, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem; and power was [there] for him to heal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A grand assembly of the learned ("phari" and "nomo") gathers, drawn from every corner ("pa komes"). The text distinguishes between the act of "teaching" (*dida*) and the presence of "power" (*dynamis*). The power was specifically *eis to iasthai* (for the healing), indicating that the divine energy was present to authenticate the teaching before the skeptics.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και ανδρεϲ φε ανθρωπ επι κλινηϲ βεβλη οϲ παραλελυμενοϲ και εζητουν αυτ ειϲενεγκειν και θειναι ενωπιον αυτου

**English Translation**
And men bringing a man upon a bed cast down [?], who [was] paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and to place [him] before him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the communal nature of faith. The "men bringing" carry the burden of the one "cast down" (*beble*). The paralytic cannot come on his own; he requires the intercession of the church (the bearers). Their goal is specific: to place him *enopion* (in the sight of) the Mercy Seat, which is Christ.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και μη ευ ποιαϲ ειϲε αυτ δια τον οχλον ανα επι το δω δια των κερα καθηκαν αυ ϲυν τω κλινι ειϲ το μεϲον εμπροϲθεν του

**English Translation**
And not finding by what [way] they might bring him in because of the crowd, going up upon the roof, through the tiles they let him down with the little bed into the midst before [Jesus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
When the earthly path is blocked by the "crowd" (the noise of the world), one must ascend. They go "up upon the roof" (*ana epi to do*). Faith dismantles obstacles—literally removing the "tiles" (*kera*)—to access the Divine. They lower him into the "midst," the center of attention, forcing a confrontation between human misery and divine pity.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδων την πιϲτ πιϲτ αυτων ειπεν αν αφεωντε ϲου αι αμαρτιαι ·

**English Translation**
And seeing the faith faith of them, he said: Man, your sins are forgiven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes "faith" twice (*pist pist*), perhaps an error, yet theologically apt: the faith of the bearers and the faith of the paralytic combined. Christ ignores the paralysis to strike at the root: sin. He calls him "Man" (*an*), restoring the dignity lost to sin, and declares the forgiveness (*apheonte*) that only God can grant.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και ηρξαντο διαλογι οι γραμμα και οι φαριϲαι λεγοντεϲ τιϲ ε ουτοϲ οϲ λα βλαϲφημιαϲ τιϲ δυναται αφιε αμαρτιαϲ ει μη μονοϲ ο

**English Translation**
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying: Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rationalists ("dialogi") stumble upon the truth without seeing it. Their premise is correct: only God can forgive sins. Their conclusion is wrong: they assume this Man is not God. They accuse the Truth of blasphemy, exposing the blindness of those who rely solely on the letter ("gramma") rather than the Spirit.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ε δε ο τουϲ διαλογιϲμουϲ αυτ αποκριθειϲ ειπ προϲ αυτουϲ τι δι εν ταιϲ καρδιεϲ καρδιαιϲ ϋμων

**English Translation**
But [Jesus], perceiving their reasonings, answering said to them: Why do you reason in your hearts hearts?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He proves His divinity not by argument, but by omniscience. He perceives their silent "reasonings." The manuscript's stutter on "hearts hearts" (*kardies kardiais*) emphasizes the depth of their internal corruption. The heart is the seat of the intellect and will; it is there, in the secret place, that they judge the Judge.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
τι εϲτιν ευκοπωτε ειπειν αφε ϲου αι αμαρτι η ειπειν εγειρε και περιπατι

**English Translation**
Which is easier to say: Your sins are forgiven, or to say: Arise and walk?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A divine riddle. To men, saying "forgiven" is easier because it is invisible and unverifiable. To say "arise" is harder because it risks visible failure. But for God, to forgive cost the blood of the Son; to heal cost but a word. He uses the visible miracle (walking) to substantiate the invisible reality (absolution).

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
δε ειδητε οτι εξου εχει ο του ανθρωπου επι τηϲ γηϲ αφιεναι αμαρτιαϲ ειπεν τω παραλυτικω ϲοι λεγω εγειρε και αρον το κλι ϲου και πορευου ειϲ τον οικον ϲου

**English Translation**
But [that] you may know that the [Son] of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins—he said to the paralytic: To you I say, arise, and taking up your bed, go into your house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads "the [Son] of Man" (*o tou anthropou*), linking His authority on earth to His heavenly origin. The command is threefold and total: "Arise" (resurrection from spiritual death), "take up" (strength to carry the former burden), and "go" (active obedience). The bed, once the sign of his bondage, becomes the trophy of his liberation, carried home as a witness.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και πα αναϲταϲ ενωπιον αυτου αραϲ εφ ο κατεκει απηλθεν ειϲ τον οικον αυτου δοξαζων τον

**English Translation**
And immediately rising before him, taking up [that] upon which he lay, he departed to his house glorifying the...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the swiftness of Divine command; the abbreviation *πα* (standing for *parachrema*, immediately) signifies that grace does not delay. He who was carried by others now carries his own bed, a visible trophy of his restoration. He departs *eis ton oikon* (to his house), restoring the social order disrupted by his infirmity. The text abruptly halts at *ton* (the), yet the intent is clear: he glorifies God, the Author of life, showing that physical healing must result in spiritual doxology.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και εκϲταϲειϲ ε απανταϲ και εδοξαζον τον και επληϲθη φοβου λεγον οτι ειδομεν πα ϲημερον

**English Translation**
And amazement took all, and they glorified the [God], and were filled with fear, saying that we saw strange things today.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd is seized by *ekstasis*—a displacement of the mind—witnessing the power of the Incarnate Word. Note the abbreviation *πα* here likely refers to *paradoxa* (strange/contrary things). They are filled with *phobos* (fear), not of terror, but of holy awe in the presence of the Divine mystery. They confess that what has occurred is beyond the order of nature (*simeron*, today), marking the intrusion of the Kingdom into earthly time.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και μετα ταυτα εξηλ και εθεαϲα τελωνην ονο λευειν καθη επι το τε και λεγει αυτω ακολουθι μοι

**English Translation**
And after these things he went out and beheld a tax collector by name Leveis sitting at the tax booth, and says to him: Follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord *exelthen* (went out) from the house to seek the lost. He *etheasato* (gazed upon) Levi; this is not a casual glance but a piercing look of election. Levi sits at the *telonion* (tax booth), the seat of avarice and collaboration with Rome, yet the call *akolouthi moi* (follow me) bridges the chasm between sin and sanctity instantly. The Physician seeks the sickest patient.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
και καταλιπων απανταϲ απαντα αναϲταϲ ηκολουθηϲεν αυ

**English Translation**
And leaving behind all [men/things] all, rising up he followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition in the manuscript *apantas apanta* (all men/all things) emphasizes the totality of the abandonment. Levi does not hesitate or calculate his loss; he rises (*anastas*)—a word of resurrection—leaving the dead works of the world behind to follow the Life (*au* for *auto*). To follow Christ requires a complete severance from the attachments of the old man.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και εποιηϲεν δοχην μεγαλην λευειϲ εν τω οικω αυτου και ην οχλοϲ πολυϲ τελωνων κ(αι) αλλ οι ηϲαν μετ αυτ κατακειμενοι

**English Translation**
And Leveis made a great reception in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Levi responds to grace with joy, hosting a *dochen megalen* (great reception). He gathers a *ochlos polys* (large crowd) of his own kind—tax collectors (*telonon*)—showing that the first act of a convert is to bring others to the source of his healing. They are *katakeimenoi* (reclining) together, a posture of fellowship and peace, foreshadowing the Eucharistic banquet where sinners are made clean.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
και εγογγυζον οι φαρι και οι γραμ προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου λε δια τι μετα των τελωνων κ(αι) αμαρτωλων εϲθι και πινετε

**English Translation**
And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured against his disciples saying: Why with the tax collectors and sinners do you eat and drink?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *Pharisaioi* and *Grammateis* (scribes) engage in *egongyzon*—a murmuring, onomatopoeic of low, sullen complaint. They cannot comprehend a holiness that does not segregate itself. They accuse the disciples of table-fellowship with *hamartolon* (sinners), failing to see that the Physician must touch the infected to cure them. Their purity is fragile; Christ's purity is contagious and cleansing.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ ου χριαν εχουϲιν οι ϊ αλλʼ οι κακωϲ εχοντεϲ

**English Translation**
And answering, the [Jesus] said to them: Those who are healthy have no need [of a physician?], but those having it badly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord identifies Himself as the Great Physician. The abbreviation *ϊ* likely stands for *iatrou* (physician) or refers to the *hygiainontes* (healthy). He declares that *kakōs echontes* (those having it badly/the sick) are the proper objects of His ministry. He exposes the Pharisees' pride: they deem themselves healthy and thus reject the cure, while the sinners acknowledge their sickness and are healed.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ουκ ελη καλεϲαι δι αλλα αϲε αμαρτωλουϲ ειϲ μετανοι

**English Translation**
I have not come to call righteous [ones], but ungodly sinners to repentance.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A definitive statement of the Incarnation's purpose. *Ouk elelytha* (I have not come) for the *dikaious* (righteous)—those who justify themselves—but for the *hamartolous*. The manuscript's *αϲε* is peculiar, perhaps a fragment of *asebeis* (ungodly), intensifying the description of the sinners. The goal is *metanoia* (repentance), a fundamental change of mind, not merely a ritual cleansing.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπον προϲ αυτον δια τι δια τι οι μα ϊωαννου νηϲτευουϲιν πυ και δεηϲειϲ ποιουνται ˙ ομοι και οι των φα οι δε ϲοι εϲθι̣ουϲιν και πι

**English Translation**
But they said to him: Why, why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, likewise also those of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double *dia ti* (why, why) in the text highlights their exasperation. They contrast the asceticism of John the Baptist (*Ioannou*) and the Pharisees with the freedom of Christ's disciples. They view religion as *nesteuousin* (fasting) and *deeseis* (prayers/supplications) performed as distinct works. They are scandalized that the followers of the Messiah are found eating and drinking (*pinousin*), mistaking the wedding feast for a funeral.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ μη δυν οι ϋιοι δυναϲθ(αι) τουϲ ϋϊουϲ του νυμ εν ω ο νυμφιοϲ μετ αυ εϲτιν νηϲτευ ποιηϲαι νηϲτευϲαι

**English Translation**
And he said to them: You cannot make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them, [can you]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is syntactically dense with corrections (*dynasthai* / *poiesai nesteusai*). The Lord introduces the image of the *Nymphios* (Bridegroom). The New Covenant is a nuptial mystery. While Christ is present (*met auton*), it is a time of joy, not mourning. To fast now would be an insult to the Bridegroom's presence. He defends his disciples' joy as the appropriate liturgical response to the Incarnation.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ελευϲονται δε ημεραι οταν α απ αυτων ο νυμφιοϲ και το νηϲτευϲουϲιν εν εκειναιϲ ταιϲ η ˙

**English Translation**
But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A shadow falls over the feast. The word *aparthe* (taken away) implies a violent removal, prophesying the Passion. The church's fasting is not a legalistic requirement like that of the Pharisees, but a fast of longing and sorrow for the Bridegroom's physical absence between the Ascension and the Parousia. *Tote* (then) marks the era of the Church, where fasting and feasting coexist in expectation.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε προϲ αυτουϲ πα και παραβολην προϲ αυτουϲ οτι ουδιϲ επιβλημα απο ϊ καινου ϲχιϲαϲ επιβαλλει επι ϊματιον παλαι ει δε μη γε κ(αι) το καινον ϲχιϲει και τω παλαιω ου ϲυμ το επι το απο του καινου

**English Translation**
And he was speaking also a parable to them: That no one tearing a patch from a new garment puts it upon an old garment; otherwise both the new will tear, and with the old the patch from the new will not agree.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord illustrates the impossibility of patching the Old Covenant with the New. One does not take from the *kainou* (new) to fix the *palai* (old). The Gospel is not a modification of the Law but a new creation. *Schisas* (tearing) indicates that the New must remain whole; it cannot be fragmented to serve the Old. The result of mixing them is that they do not *symphonei* (harmonize/agree). The Christian faith requires a new wineskin, a new garment, a total renovation of the heart.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
και ουδειϲ βαλλει οινον νε ειϲ αϲκουϲ πα ει δε μη γε ρηξει ο οινοϲ τουϲ αϲκουϲ και αυτοϲ εκχυθηϲεται και οι αϲκοι απολο απολο

**English Translation**
And no one casts wine [new] into wineskins [old]; otherwise indeed the wine will burst the wineskins and it [itself] will be poured out and the wineskins [will perish / will perish].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal urgency in the duplication `απολο απολο` (*apolountai*—they will perish). The text trembles at the incompatibility of the Living Spirit (`οινον νε`—new wine) with the brittle, desiccated forms of the Old Covenant (`αϲκουϲ πα`—old skins). The Grace of the Incarnation is fermenting and expansive; it demands a heart that is elastic and living. If we attempt to confine the mystery of Christ within the rigid legalisms of the past, we suffer a double loss: the Grace is spilled (`εκχυθηϲεται`) and wasted on the ground, and the old structures themselves are utterly ruined. One cannot hoard the Spirit in the vessel of a dead letter.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
αλλα οινον νε ειϲ αϲκουϲ και βαλλουϲιν βλητεον βλητεον

**English Translation**
But wine [new] into wineskins [new] [and they cast] must be cast [must be cast].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imperative here is absolute, emphasized by the repetition `βλητεον βλητεον` (must be cast, must be cast). The text presented contains a curious reading, inserting `και βαλλουϲιν` (and they cast) alongside the verbal adjective. This reinforces the active duty of the priesthood and the faithful. We do not merely observe the new wine; we *must* prepare the new vessel. The "new skins" are the renewed minds of the baptized, washed of the old leaven. The command is doubled because the temptation to return to the old vessel is strong; we are exhorted twice to ensure the containment of the precious blood in a vessel worthy of its sanctity.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και ουδιϲ πιων παλαιον θελει νε λεγει γαρ ο πα χρηϲτοϲ ε

**English Translation**
And no one having drunk old [wine] wants new; for he says the [old] is good [is].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the diagnosis of spiritual lethargy. The soul that has intoxicated itself on the shadows of the Law (`παλαιον`) or the comforts of the world loses the appetite for the vigor of the Gospel (`νε`—*neon*). The text abbreviates `χρηϲτοϲ` (good/useful/kind), a word phonetically identical to *Christos* in our speech, yet here referring to the "goodness" of the old wine as perceived by the dull palate. The man accustomed to the heavy, settled wine of tradition finds the fresh, fermenting wine of the Spirit too sharp. He claims the old is `χρηϲτοϲ` (good enough), and thus rejects the best. We must fast from the old to cultivate a thirst for the new.
