**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και ειϲελ διηρχετο την ϊερειχω ·

**English Translation**
And enter[ing] he passed through Jericho.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the economy of the Savior’s movement. The text reads *eisel*—an abbreviated entrance—signifying the urgency of His mission. He does not merely dwell in the city of palms but passes through (*diērcheto*). Jericho, the city once accursed by Joshua, now receives the blessing of the True Joshua (Jesus). He enters the low place, the city of the depths, to raise up those fallen into the abyss of sin. He passes through the world, not to remain in it, but to gather His own.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ανηρ ονο καλουμε ζακχαιοϲ · και αυτοϲ ην αρχιτε και ην πλου

**English Translation**
And behold a man by nam[e] calle[d] Zacchaeus; and he was a chief-tax[collector] and was ric[h].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the description of this man. The scribe abbreviates his titles—*archite* for chief publican, *plou* for rich—as if the Spirit hastens to show us the man's soul rather than his office. He is "called" Zacchaeus, which means 'pure' or 'innocent,' yet his office is one of extortion. There is a mystery here: a name of purity buried under the filth of avarice. He is a ruler of tax-gatherers, a chief among sinners, yet the Divine Eye sees the potential for restoration. Riches (*plou*) are often a barrier, yet here they are the setting for a miracle of grace.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και εζητει ϊ τον τιϲ εϲ και ουκ ηδυνα απο του οχλου οτι τη ηλικια μι ην

**English Translation**
And he sought J[esus] the [one] who he is and could not from the crowd because in stature sma[ll] he was.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He sought to see *I* (Jesus), the Savior. The text abbreviates the Holy Name, enclosing it in the sacred silence of the nomina sacra. Zacchaeus desires the vision of God, but two obstacles prevent him: the *ochlos* (crowd) and his own nature (*mikros*, small). The crowd represents the turbulence of worldly cares and the multitude of sins that block the vision of Christ. His small stature signifies the humility of our human condition, which cannot reach the Divine height without assistance. He seeks "who he is"—not merely His face, but His identity, His substance.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και προδραμων ειϲ το εμπροϲθ εμπροϲθ ανεβη επι ϲυκο του ϊνα αυτον οτι εκεινηϲ ημελλεν διερχε

**English Translation**
And running forward to the front front he went up on a syco[more] so that [he might see] him because of that [way] he was about to pass throug[h].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *emprosthen* (front/forward), emphasizing the eagerness of the soul running toward grace. Zacchaeus ascends a *syko* (fig-mulberry), a tree of foolishness, to see Wisdom Incarnate. He rises above the earth to see the One who came down from Heaven. The text says he did this *ina auton* (so that him)—the verb 'to see' is elided in the letter, yet present in the intent. He anticipates the path of the Lord; for Christ must pass through the specific path of our life to meet us. We must climb the wood of the Cross, as Zacchaeus climbed the wood of the tree, to behold the Savior.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και ωϲ ηλθ επι τον τοπον α ὁ ει προϲ αυτον ζακχαιε ϲπευϲαϲ καταβηθι ϲημε γαρ εν τω οι ϲου δι με μει

**English Translation**
And as he cam[e] to the place l[ooking up] the [Jesus] sai[d] to him Zacchaeus having hastened come down today for in the hou[se] of you mus[t] me rem[ain].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is fragmented, reading *a o ei*—shorthands for the Lord's action of looking up and speaking. The Lord commands: *speusas katabēthi* (hasten and come down). Humility must follow the ascent. He who climbed in pride or curiosity must descend in obedience. The necessity is absolute: *dei* (it is necessary/must). It is the divine decree that Salvation must abide (*meinai*) in the house of the sinner. The *oikō* (house) is the heart; Christ does not merely visit the intellect but takes up residence in the center of the man's being.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και ϲπευϲαϲ κα και ϋπεδεξα αυτον χαιρων

**English Translation**
And having hastened he [came down] and received him rejoicing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Obedience is immediate: *speusas* (hastening). There is no delay between the command of God and the action of the faithful soul. He received Him *chairōn* (rejoicing). Joy is the hallmark of the Gospel's reception. The heavy burden of his wealth and his sin is lifted by the presence of the Guest. To receive Christ is to receive Joy itself. The text stammers with *ka kai*, as if the scribe himself hurries to record the descent of the publican.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδοντεϲ παν διεγογγυζον λεγοντεϲ οτι πα ανδρι αμαρτω ειϲηλθεν κα ·

**English Translation**
And seeing al[l] murmured saying that wi[th] a man sinn[er] he entered to lo[dge].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitude, *pantes* (all), murmur. The world cannot comprehend the mercy of God. They see only the *andri amartōlō* (man sinner); they define Zacchaeus by his past, but Christ defines him by his future. They complain that the Holy One enters to *katalysai* (lodge/rest) with the unclean. But the Physician must touch the sick to heal them. The murmuring of the crowd is the sound of self-righteousness, which is deaf to the harmonies of grace.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ϲταθειϲ δε ο ζακχαιοϲ ειπεν προϲ τον ϊδου τα ημιϲια μου τ ϋπαρχοντων τοιϲ πτωχοιϲ διδω και ει τινοϲ τι εϲυκοφαντηϲα αποδιδωμι τετρα

**English Translation**
Standing but Zacchaeus said to the [Lord] behold the halves of me of the goods to the poor I give and if of anyone anything I extorted I give back four[fold].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Zacchaeus stands (*statheis*)—a posture of firmness and new resolve. He addresses the *Ton* (The [Lord]), acknowledging the Master. The fruit of repentance is immediate charity and restitution. He does not merely feel sorry; he acts. He gives half his substance to the *ptōchois* (poor) and restores fourfold (*tetraploun*) what was stolen, exceeding the requirements of the Law. This is the evidence of the indwelling Christ: the loosening of the grip of mammon. The text shows *esyko-phantēsa* (extorted/slandered)—he admits his specific sin of false accusation for gain.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυ ο οτι ϲημερ ϲωτηρια τω οικω τουτω εγενετο καθοτι και αυτοϲ ϋϊοϲ αβρααμʼ εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
Said but to hi[m] the [Jesus] that toda[y] salvation to house this has happened because also he son of Abraham is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord declares the reality of the moment: *sēmeron* (today). Salvation is not a distant hope but a present reality. It comes to the *oikō* (house), sanctifying the domestic sphere and the family. The reason is given: he too is a *huios Abraam* (son of Abraham). He was a son by lineage, but lost by conduct; now he is restored by faith. Faith works through love and restitution. The "lost" sheep is found within the fold of the patriarchs.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ηλθ ηλθ γαρ ο υϊοϲ του αν ζητηϲαι και ϲωϲαι το απο ·

**English Translation**
Came came for the son of ma[n] to seek and to save the lo[st].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe doubles the verb *ēlth ēlth* (came came), perhaps an error, or perhaps a divine emphasis on the advent of the Messiah. He is the *Huios tou Anthrōpou* (Son of Man)—the Title of Humility and Judgment combined. His mission is twofold: *zētēsai* (to seek) and *sōsai* (to save). He seeks that which has wandered; He saves that which is *apolōlos* (perishing/lost). The text ends abruptly on *apo*, signifying the 'lost' things. We are all the 'lost' until the Seeker finds us.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ακου δε αυτ ταυτα προϲθειϲ ειπεν παραβολ παραβολ δια το εγγυϲ ειναι ϊερουϲαλημ αυτ αυτ και δοκει αυτοιϲ δοκειν αυτουϲ δοκειν αυτουϲ οτι παραχρημα η βαϲιλεια του μελλει αναφαινε

**English Translation**
Hear[ing] but the[m] these things adding he said a parabl[e] parabl[e] because the near being Jerusalem hi[m] hi[m] and think[s] them think[ing] them think[ing] them that immediately the kingdom of [God] is about to appear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is tumultuous, filled with repetitions (*parabol parabol*, *aut aut*, *dokein... dokein...*), reflecting the confusion of the disciples. They thought the Kingdom was *parachrēma* (immediate/instant). They saw Jerusalem and expected glory; Christ sees Jerusalem and prepares for the Cross. He adds a parable to correct their eschatology. They suppose the Kingdom appears with observation; He teaches it comes through stewardship and long waiting. The stuttering text mirrors the stuttering faith of those who demand signs *now* rather than endure to the end.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν ανθρω τιϲ ευγενηϲ επορευθη ειϲ χω μακραν λαβε λαβε εαυτω βαϲιλειαν · και ϋποϲτρεψαι ˙

**English Translation**
He said therefore ma[n] certain well-born went into countr[y] far to recei[ve] recei[ve] for himself a kingdom and to return.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *anthrōpos eugenēs* (noble man) is Christ Himself, noble by eternal generation from the Father. He goes to a *chōran makran* (far country)—this signifies His ascension to the Heavens, far from the earth in dignity, though near in presence. He goes to receive a *basileian* (kingdom). The repetition *labe labe* emphasizes the certainty of His coronation by the Father. But note the end: *kai hypostrepsai* (and to return). The Christian life is lived in the interim between the Departure and the Return. We are not to expect the Kingdom's fullness instantly (as they thought in verse 11), but we must occupy until He returns.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
κα δε δεκα δου εαυτου εδω αυτοιϲ δεκα μναϲ · και ειπεν προϲ αυ πραγματευϲα εν ω ερχομαι

**English Translation**
[Calling] then ten slaves of himself, he gave to them ten minas; and said to them, "Do business while I am coming."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the economy of the Master. He entrusts the "ten" (`δεκα`), a number signifying fullness and completion in the temporal order, to his own bondsmen. The command `πραγματευϲα` (do business/trade) implies that the interim time—between the departure and the `ερχομαι` (coming)—is not for idleness but for the active multiplication of the divine gift. The Lord withdraws his visible presence so that the fidelity of the servant may be tested by his industry in the Master's absence.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
οι δε πολειται αυτου εμιϲουν αυτον κ(αι) απεϲτιλαν πρεϲ οπιϲω αυτου λεγοντεϲ ου θελομ τουτον βαϲιλευϲαι εφ ημαϲ

**English Translation**
But his citizens were hating him and sent an embassy behind him, saying, "We do not wish this one to reign over us."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of iniquity: the `πολειται` (citizens), who by right belong to him, harbor a deep-seated hatred (`εμιϲουν`, in the imperfect, suggesting a continuous state). They send their rebellion "behind him," rejecting his kingship (`βαϲιλευϲαι`) while he is journeying to receive it. This mirrors the rejection of the Logos by the world; they desire autonomy rather than the sweet yoke of the rightful King.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και εγενε εν τω επανελθ αυτον λαβοντα τ βαϲιλειαν και ειπ φωνηθηναι αυτω τουϲ δουλουϲ του οιϲ δεδωκει το αργυριον ϊνα γνοι τι διεπραγματευϲ διεπραγματευϲ ·

**English Translation**
And it happened upon his returning, having received the kingdom, and he commanded to be called to him those slaves to whom he had given the silver, in order that he might know what they gained by trading.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rebellion of the citizens does not prevent the coronation; he returns `λαβοντα τ βαϲιλειαν` (having received the kingdom). The judgment begins not with the enemies, but with the house of God. He summons the servants to know (`γνοι`) the fruit of their labor. The scribe's repetition of `διεπραγματευϲ` (gained by trading) emphasizes the intensity of this accounting—every transaction of grace must be reckoned.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
παρεγενετο δε ο πρωτοϲ λεγ η μνα ϲου δεκα προϲηργαϲα προϲειργαϲατο μναϲ

**English Translation**
And the first arrived, saying, "Your mina has worked in addition ten minas."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the humility of the faithful servant. He does not say, "I have earned," but "Your mina (`η μνα ϲου`) has worked in addition." He attributes the generative power to the capital itself—the grace of God—rather than his own toil. The single mina becomes a decalogue of fruitfulness. The correction in the manuscript (`προϲηργαϲα` to `προϲειργαϲατο`) shifts the focus firmly to the mina as the active agent.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτω ευ δουλε αγαθε οτι εν ελαχιϲτω πιϲτοϲ εγενου ϊϲθι εξουϲι εχων επανω δεκα πολεων

**English Translation**
And he said to him, "Well [done], good slave; because you became faithful in the least, be having authority over ten cities."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reward transcends the labor infinitely. Fidelity in `ελαχιϲτω` (the least thing)—material wealth or temporal time—yields authority over `πολεων` (cities), representing the governance of souls or high spiritual offices in the age to come. The correspondence is numerical (ten for ten), but the substance changes from silver to sovereignty.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και ηλθεν ο δευτε λεγων η μνα μναϲ ϲου εποιηϲεν πεντε μναϲ ·

**English Translation**
And the second came, saying, "Your mina has made five minas."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The second servant also acknowledges the source: "Your mina has made (`εποιηϲεν`) five." There is no jealousy here, only the honest presentation of fruit. The variation in yield suggests that while grace is given, the capacity to receive and multiply it varies among the saints, yet all who increase are accepted.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε και του και ϲυ επανω γεινου πεντε πο

**English Translation**
And he said also to this one, "And you, become over five cities."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command `γεινου` (become thou) effects a change in ontology; the servant is transformed into a ruler. The abbreviation `πο` stands for `πολεων` (cities). The Master's justice is precise; the reward is commensurate with the capacity demonstrated. He does not demand ten from the one who produced five, but he rewards the five fully.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και ο τεροϲ ετεροϲ ηλθεν λεγων ϊδου η μνα μναϲ ϲου ην ειχ ειχ αποκειμενην εν ϲουδαριω

**English Translation**
And the other came, saying, "Behold your mina, which I was having laid away in a sweat-cloth."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the tragedy of the `ϲουδαριω` (sudarium)—a cloth used for wiping sweat or binding the face of the dead. This servant treated the living, dynamic gift of God as a corpse to be buried. He preserved it, yes, but in a sterile state. The stuttering of the scribe (`ειχ ειχ`, "I had, I had") mirrors the trembling hesitation of the slothful soul who possesses the gift but refuses the labor.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
εφο γαρ ϲε οτι ανθρωποϲ αυϲτη ει αιριϲ ο ουκ ε και θερι ο ουκ εϲπιραϲ

**English Translation**
For I was fearing you, because you are a harsh man; you take up what you did not lay down, and you reap what you did not sow.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant justifies his sloth by maligning the Master's character. He calls him `αυϲτη` (austere/harsh) and accuses him of reaping where he has not sown. This is the theology of the wicked: they view God as a tyrant who demands the impossible, rather than a Father who empowers. His fear (`εφο`, from `εφοβουμην`) is a servile dread that paralyzes rather than a filial fear that motivates.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω εκ του ϲτοματοϲ ϲου κρι ϲε πονηρε δου ˙ ηδιϲ οτι εγω αν αυϲτηροϲ ειμι αιρων ο ουκ ε και θεριζ ο ουκ εϲπιρα

**English Translation**
He says to him, "Out of your mouth I will judge you, wicked slave. Did you know that I am a harsh man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master turns the servant's accusation into the verdict: `εκ του ϲτοματοϲ ϲου` (out of your mouth). He does not accept the premise that He is unjust, but argues from the servant's own logic. If the servant truly believed the Master was grasping and severe, terror should have driven him to profit, not idleness. Thus, the plea of "fear" is exposed as a mask for wickedness (`πονηρε`).

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και δια τι ουκ εδωκαϲ μου το αργυριον επι τραπεζαν κα ελθων ουν ϲ τοκω αν αυτο ε

**English Translation**
"And why did you not give my silver upon a table [bank]? And I, coming, would have exacted it with interest."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The `τραπεζαν` (table of the money-changers) represents the communal life of the Church or the distribution of alms—the minimum effort where the gift might bear fruit through the hands of others. The servant refused even this passive righteousness. The Master expects `τοκω` (interest/offspring); grace must be fertile. The barrenness of the soul is its own condemnation.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και τοιϲ πα ειπεν αρε αρατε απ αυτου την μναν και δοτε τω ταϲ δεκα μναϲ εχον

**English Translation**
And to those standing by he said, "Take from him the mina, and give to the one having the ten minas."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Grace is not static; it is transferred. The `πα` (bystanders, likely angels) are commanded to strip the slothful one. The mina is given to the one who has ten, for he has proven his capacity to steward the divine mysteries. To him who has the reality of grace (usage), more is given; from him who has only the appearance (possession without fruit), even that is taken away.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και ειπαν αυτω εχει δεκα μναϲ

**English Translation**
And they said to him, "He has ten minas."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the astonishment of the earthly mind, which perceives justice only as equality or distribution based on lack. The bystanders protest the abundance given to the fruitful servant, for they do not understand the spiritual economy of the Kingdom: that grace is attracted to capacity. He who stewards the mysteries of God well is entrusted with more, not because of greed, but because he has proven he is a vessel that will not spill the wine of the Spirit.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
λεγω υμιν οτι παντι τω εχοντι δοθηϲε απο δε του μη εχοντοϲ και ο ε αρθηϲεται απ αυτου

**English Translation**
I say to you that to everyone having, it will be given; but from the one not having, even what he has will be taken from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful maxim for the indolent soul. The scribe abbreviates *dothēsetai* to *dothēse*, hastening to the grim conclusion. The phrase "even what he has" (*o e* in the manuscript) signifies that even our natural gifts—reason, life, opportunity—are forfeit if not employed for the Master. There is no stasis in the spiritual life; one is either gaining ground in holiness or losing the very ground one stands upon.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
πλην τουϲ εχθρουϲ μου τουτουϲ τουϲ μη θεληϲανταϲ με βαϲιλευϲαι ε αυτουϲ αγαγετε ωδε και καταϲφα αυτουϲ εμ μου ·

**English Translation**
However, these enemies of mine, the ones not willing that I reign over them, bring here and slaughter them before me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Shepherd speaks as the Judge. The text is stark—*kataspha* (slaughter)—leaving no room for soft interpretation. To refuse the reign of Christ is not a neutral liberty; it is an act of cosmic treason. The manuscript reads *em mou* (before me), indicating that this judgment is personal and immediate. Let the heretic who denies the judgment tremble, for the King returns not only to reward the faithful stewards but to execute the sentence upon the rebellious will.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
και ειπων ταυτα ε εμπρο αναβαιν ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα

**English Translation**
And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Having pronounced the law of the Kingdom, the King now enacts it. He goes *empro* (before/forward). He does not command us to a cross He has not first carried. The ascent to Jerusalem is the ascent to the altar. He walks with the determination of the victim who is also the Priest, leading the trembling disciples toward the necessary tragedy of the Passion.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο ωϲ ηγ ειϲ βηθφα και βηθανια βηθανι προϲ το οροϲ το καλουμενον ελε απεϲτιλεν δυο των μαθητων

**English Translation**
And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, toward the mount called Olives, he sent two of the disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters on the location—*bethania bethani*—as if emphasizing the house of obedience and suffering. He approaches the *ele* (Olives), the place of crushing and oil. The geography is theological: He draws near to the place where the oil of gladness will be mixed with the sweat of blood. He sends two, for the testimony of two is true, initiating the final procession.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
λεγων ϋπαγετε ειϲ την κατεναντι κωμην εν η ειϲ ευ πωλον δε εφ ον ου πωποτε ανθρω εκαθιϲεν λυ αυτον αγα

**English Translation**
Saying, "Go into the opposite village, in which entering you will find a colt tied, on which never yet a man sat; loose him [and] bring [him]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The colt, *polon*, upon which no *anthrō* (man) has sat, typifies the Gentile nations, wild and unclean, or perhaps the virgin soul not yet burdened by the yoke of sin's dominion. Only the Creator can sit upon such unbroken nature and guide it without bit or bridle, taming it by the sheer weight of His holiness. The command *ly* (loose) signifies the liberation of the creature for the service of the Creator.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
και εαν τιϲ ϋμαϲ ερω δια τι λυετε αυτον ουτωϲ ερειτε οτι ο αυτου χριαν εχει ˙

**English Translation**
And if anyone asks you, "Why do you loose [it]?" thus you shall say, "Because the [Lord] has need of it."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is elliptical, reading simply *o* (The [Lord]) *autou chrian echei*. The definite article stands alone, implying the Supreme Subject. The Master asserts absolute right over property. All things created belong to Him; when He claims them, He is but recalling His own. "The Lord has need" is the highest honor a creature can receive—to be necessary for the unfolding of the divine mystery.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
απελθ απελθ δε οι απεϲταλμε ευρον καθωϲ ειπεν αυτοιϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having departed, the sent ones found just as he said to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript repeats *apelth apelth* (departed, departed), perhaps a scribal error, or perhaps capturing the haste and immediate obedience of the disciples. Faith is the evidence of things not seen; they went before they saw, and because they obeyed the command, the reality manifested *kathōs eipen* (just as he said). The Word of God precedes the reality of the world.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
λυον δε αυτων τον πωλον ειπαν οι κυριοι αυτου προϲ αυτουϲ τι λυετε τ τ πωλον

**English Translation**
And as they were loosing the colt, its lords said to them, "Why do you loose the colt?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we see "lords" (plural, earthly owners) versus the "Lord" (singular, divine Owner). The world asks, "Why do you loose?" It does not understand the liberation of resources for spiritual ends. The earthly owners see a loss of property; the disciples see the preparation for a King. The tension between secular possession and divine requisition is laid bare.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπ ειπ οτι ο αυτου χρι χρι εχει

**English Translation**
And they said, "The [Lord] has need of it."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe's hand trembles again—*eip eip* (said said), *chri chri* (need need). The answer is simple and final. They offer no payment, no argument, only the Name. This is the authority of the Church: we claim the world for Christ not by force of arms, but by the declaration of His need. The repetition emphasizes the urgency: the Passion cannot wait; the donkey must be brought.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και ηγαγον αυ προϲ τον και επιριψαντεϲ αυτ τα ϊματια επι τον πωλον επεβιβα τον ˙

**English Translation**
And they brought him to the [Jesus], and having thrown their garments upon the colt, they set the [Jesus] upon [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They bring the colt to *ton* (the [one/Jesus]). They cast their garments—symbols of their own dignity and covering—onto the beast to make a throne for the Humble One. *Epebiba* (they set [him] upon) shows their active participation in His enthronement. They do not wait for a miracle; they use their own cloaks to facilitate the miracle of the King's entry. We must clothe the instruments of God with our own substance.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
πορευ δε αυτου ϋπεϲτρωννυον τα ϊματια αυτων εν τη οδω ˙

**English Translation**
And as he was journeying, they were spreading their garments in the way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A liturgy of total surrender. *Hypestrōnnyon* implies spreading out as a bed or carpet. They pave the dusty road with their possessions. They acknowledge that the very ground He traverses is holy. If the colt represents the Gentiles, the garments represent the glory of the disciples laid down in the dust for the feet of the Messiah. He rides toward death, and they pave the way with the symbols of their lives.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
εγγιζοντοϲ δε αυ ηδη προϲ τη κα του ορουϲ τ ελαιων ηρξαντο απαν το πληθοϲ των μαθητων χαιροντεϲ αινιν τον φωνη μεγα περι παϲων ειδον δυναμεων

**English Translation**
And as He was already drawing near to the [descent] of the Mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise [God] with a loud voice concerning all the powers they saw.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the geography of salvation: the Lord approaches the "descent" (*katabasei*, here abbreviated *ka*) of the Mount of Olives. Just as the oil of mercy flows down, so too does the Savior descend towards the city that will reject Him. The multitude praises Him for the "powers" (*dynameon*)—the miracles—they had witnessed. Yet, we note the distinction: they praise Him for His works of power, but the true disciple must learn to praise Him for the mystery of His suffering, which begins upon this very mount.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ ευλογη ο ερχομενοϲ βαϲιλευϲ εν ονοματι ε ουρανω εν ϊρη και δοξα εν υ ·

**English Translation**
Saying, Blessed is the coming King in the name of [the Lord]; in heaven peace, and glory in the hi[ghest].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the proclamation of the Kingdom. The Sinaiticus scribe abbreviates the divine name simply as *ε* (likely for *Kyriou* or perhaps a scribal contraction), and *hypsistois* as *y*. The crowd echoes the angelic hymn of the Nativity, yet with a shift: peace is now proclaimed "in heaven" (*ourano*), for on earth, the war against the Incarnate Word is about to commence. The King comes not with the weapons of this world, but in the "name," bearing the authority of the Father.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και τινεϲ των φαριϲαιων απο του οχλου ει προϲ αυτον διδαϲκαλε επιτι τοιϲ μαθη ϲου

**English Translation**
And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to Him, "Teacher, rebuke Your disci[ples]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The envy of the Pharisees is deaf to the Spirit. They address the Lord merely as *Didaskale* (Teacher), stripping Him of the title *Basileus* (King) which the crowd had just bestowed. They demand a rebuke (*epitimeson*, here *epiti*) of the truth, wishing to silence the liturgy of the faithful. It is the perennial habit of the arrogant to demand silence when the humble are moved by God to speak.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ειπ ειπ λεγω ϋμιν οτι εαν ουτοι ϲιωπηϲουϲ ϲιωπηϲουϲ οι λιθοι κραξουϲιν

**English Translation**
And answering He said, "I say to you that if these should be silent, the stones will cry out."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful mystery! The Lord asserts that creation itself possesses a voice to testify to its Creator. If rational man, made in the image of God, fails to offer the sacrifice of praise, the irrational creation—the very stones (*lithoi*)—will convict him by performing his duty. The repetition in the text (*siopesous siopesous*) emphasizes the impossibility of suppressing the glory of God; truth cannot be silenced, only transferred.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
και ωϲ ηγγιϲεν ϊδ ϊδ την πολιν εκλαυϲ επ αυτην

**English Translation**
And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the compassion of the Incarnate Word. He does not weep for His own approaching passion, but for the blindness of Jerusalem. The double *id id* (seeing) in the manuscript underscores the intensity of His gaze; He sees not only the stones of the Temple but the ruin of the souls within. He weeps because He is the Physician, and the patient has rejected the cure.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
λεγων οτι ει εγνωϲ εν τη ημερα ταυτη και ϲυ τα προϲ ϊρηνην νυν δε εκρυβη απο οφθαλμων ϲου

**English Translation**
Saying, "If you had known, in this day, even you, the things toward peace! But now it was hidden from your eyes."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tragedy of the missed *kairos* (moment). "This day" was the day of visitation, the moment eternity touched time. "The things toward peace" (*ta pros irenen*) refers to the acceptance of the Messiah, who is our Peace. But because of their hardness of heart, the truth is "hidden" (*ekrybe*). God does not hide the truth arbitrarily; rather, the eye that refuses to see the light eventually loses the capacity to see it.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
οτι ηξουϲιν ημεραι επι ϲε και παρεμβα οι εχθροι ϲου χαρακα ϲοι και περικυκλωϲουϲ ϲε και ϲυνεξουϲιν ϲε παντοθεν

**English Translation**
"Because days will come upon you, and your enemies will [cast up] a rampart against you, and will encircle you, and will hem you in from all sides."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord prophesies the Roman siege with terrible precision. The spiritual encirclement by sin leads inevitably to the physical encirclement by enemies. The "rampart" (*charaka*) is the material manifestation of the spiritual barrier the city raised against its King. They hemmed in the Truth, so they shall be hemmed in by destruction.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
και ε ϲε και τα τεκνα ϲου εν ϲοι και ουκ αφηϲουϲ λιθον επι λιθον εν ϲοι ανθ ων ου εγνωϲ τον και τηϲ επιϲκο ϲου

**English Translation**
"And [they will dash] you [to the ground], and your children in you, and will not leave stone upon stone in you, because you did not know the time of your visitation."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abbreviates the horror: *e* stands for *edaphiousin* (they will dash to the ground). The destruction is total—"stone upon stone" shall not remain. Why? The cause is ignorance: "You did not know." This is not innocent ignorance, but a willful rejection of the "visitation" (*episkopes*), the moment when God inspected His vineyard and found only wild grapes.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
και ειϲελθων ειϲ το ϊερον ηρξατο εκβαλλειν τουϲ πωλουνταϲ

**English Translation**
And entering into the temple, He began to cast out those selling.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The King takes possession of His palace. His first act is purification. He casts out the merchants, teaching us that the House of God is not a place for transaction or worldly gain. The zeal of the Lord burns against those who turn piety into profit. He cleanses the earthly temple to prepare the way for the spiritual temple, which is the Church.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
λεγ αυτοιϲ γεγραπται κ(αι) εϲται ο οικοϲ μου οικοϲ προϲευχηϲ ϋμειϲ δε αυτον ε ϲπηλαι ληϲτον ληϲτων

**English Translation**
Saying to them, "It is written, 'And My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you [made] it a cave of robbers."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He quotes the prophets to convict the priests. The manuscript reads *kai estai* (and it shall be), emphasizing the future, eternal nature of true worship. He contrasts "house of prayer" with "cave of robbers" (*spelaion leston*). A cave is a dark place where bandits hide their loot; the temple authorities were using religion to hide their avarice. The repetition *leston leston* in the text amplifies the accusation of thievery.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
και διδαϲκων το κα ημεραν εν τω ϊερω οι ϊερω οι δε αρχϊερειϲ και οι γραμματειϲ εζη αυτον απο και οι πρωτοι του λαου

**English Translation**
And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the leaders of the people were seeking to [destroy] Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A stark contrast: The Light shines "daily" (*to kath hemeran*) through His teaching, while the darkness seeks to extinguish it. The "chief priests and scribes" conspire with the "leaders of the people." The text abbreviates *apolesai* (to destroy) as *apo*, as if the scribe shrinks from writing the full intent of their malice. Those charged with preserving the Law now seek to destroy the Lawgiver.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
και ουχ ευ το τι ποιη ο λαοϲ γαρ α εξεκρεμετο αυτου ακουων ·

**English Translation**
And they did not find what they might do; for the people [all] hung on Him, listening.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The malice of the rulers is checked by the hunger of the flock. The people "hung" (*exekremeto*) upon His words. This vivid verb suggests a total dependence; they were suspended upon His teaching as their only life and support. When the soul clings to the Word of God, the plots of the enemy are rendered impotent. The chapter concludes with the victory of the Word over the will of the wicked.
