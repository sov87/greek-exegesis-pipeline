**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω καθεξηϲ και αυτοϲ διωδευϲεν κατα πολιν και κωμ κηρυϲϲων και ευ την βαϲιλειαν του και οι δωδε ϲυν αυτω

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in the sequence [afterwards], and he himself journeyed through city and vill[age], preaching and ev[angelizing] the kingdom of [God], and the twelve [were] with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the ceaseless motion of the Logos Incarnate. He does not wait in the temple but journeys *kata polin* (city by city), sanctifying the earth by His footsteps. The scribe abbreviates *komas* (villages) and *evangelizomenos* (evangelizing), yet the meaning stands firm: Christ brings the *Basileian Tou* (Kingdom of God/Him) not merely as a herald (*kerysson*) announcing a decree, but as a bringer of good tidings (*eu...*). The presence of the "Twelve" alongside Him establishes the foundation of the Church—the apostolic witness accompanying the Divine Word.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και γυναικεϲ τινεϲ αι ηϲαν τεθεραπευ απο π π ακαθαρτων και αϲθενειων μα η καλουμενη μαγδαληνη αφ ηϲ δαιμονια επτα ε

**English Translation**
And certain women who had been healed from unclean s[pirits] and infirmities, Ma[ry] the one called Magdalene, from whom seven demons [had gone out].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we see the breadth of redemption. Not only men, but women (*gynaikes*) follow, bound by gratitude for healing (*tetherapeu...*). The text stammers at *p... p...* (likely *pneumaton*/spirits), reflecting perhaps the shuddering reality of the unclean spirits mentioned. Mary Magdalene is singled out; the "seven demons" indicate a plenitude of former possession, now conquered by the One who commands the abyss. That they "had gone out" (indicated by the final epsilon *e...*) testifies that where Light dwells, darkness must depart.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και ϊ γυνη χου επιτροπου η και ϲουϲαν και ετεραι πολ αιτινεϲ διηκο αυτω εκ τ τ αυ αυταιϲ αυταιϲ

**English Translation**
And J[oanna] wife of Chu[za] steward of H[erod], and Susan[na], and many others who ministered to him out of [their own possessions].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Gospel penetrates even the courts of the tyrant, for Joanna is the wife of Herod’s steward. The scribe struggles greatly at the end of this verse (*ek t t au autais autais*), a garbled attempt to say "out of their substance" (*hyparchonton*). Yet the spiritual lesson remains: these women transformed mammon into ministry (*diekonoun*). They sustained the Sustainer of the Universe with their material goods, showing that the proper use of wealth is the service of the Word.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ϲυνοντοϲ ϲυνϊοντοϲ δε οχλου πολλου και των κατα πολιν επι προϲ αυτον ειπ ειπ δια παραβοληϲ

**English Translation**
And when a great crowd was coming together, and those according to [each] city were coming to him, he s[aid] by means of a parable.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text corrects itself—*synontos* to *syniontos*—emphasizing the active gathering of the multitude. They come from every city, driven by a hunger the world cannot satisfy. The Lord shifts His method here; He speaks *dia paraboles* (through a parable). He veils the truth in imagery, not to hide it from the seeker, but to provoke the mind to labor for the meaning. The stutter *eip eip* (said) marks the solemn opening of His mouth.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθεν ο ϲπιρ ϲπιρ του ϲπιραι τον ϲπο αυτου και εν τω ϲπιρειν αυτον ο μεν επεϲεν παρα την οδον και κατεπατηθη και τα πετινα του ουρανου κατε αυτο

**English Translation**
The sower went out to sow his seed; and in his sowing, some indeed fell beside the way, and was trampled down, and the birds of heaven devoured it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stammers on *spir spir* (sower) and abbreviates *sporon* (seed) to *spo*. The Sower is the Son of Man; the going out is His Incarnation. That which falls "beside the way" represents the soul exposed to the traffic of the world, hardened by the feet of passing thoughts. It is *katepatethe* (trampled) by secular cares before the "birds"—the aerial powers of wickedness—snatch it away. The seed is not at fault; the ground is unprepared.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και ε επεϲεν ε την πετραν και φυεν εξηρ εξηρ και δια το μη εχιν ϊκμαδα

**English Translation**
And oth[er] fell on the rock; and having sprouted, it withered because it had no moisture.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is fragmented: *e* for *heteron* (other) and *e* for *epi* (on). This seed falls on *petran* (rock). It sprouts (*phyen*), showing an initial, emotional reception of the Gospel. But the scribe’s repetition of *exer... exer...* (withered) underscores the tragedy of the result. It dies for lack of *ikmada* (moisture). Without the deep waters of the Spirit and the root of patience, the heat of trial desiccates the soul that lives only on the surface.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και ετερον επεϲ επεϲ εν μεϲω των α και ϲυν αι ακαν επνιξαν απεπνιξαν αυτο

**English Translation**
And other fell in the midst of the th[orns]; and the thorns having sprung up with it choked [and] strangled it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stutter *epes epes* (fell) mimics the scattering of seed. It falls among *a...* (thorns, *akanthon*). Note the violence of the verbs: *epnixan* (choked) corrected or intensified to *apepnixan* (choked off/strangled). The thorns grow *syn* (with) the good seed. This is the divided heart, attempting to harbor both the Word of God and the cares of this life. The thorns, being native to the fallen earth, grow faster and strangle the divine planting.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και ετερον εφυ επεϲ επεϲ ειϲ την γην την αγαθην και εφυ και φυ φυ εποιηϲεν καρ εκατοντα ταυτα λεγων εφωνει ο εχων ωτα ακου ακουετω

**English Translation**
And other fell into the good earth; and having sprouted, it made fruit a hundredfold. Saying these things he called out: He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the abundance of grace. The scribe struggles with the verbs (*ephy epes epes... phy phy*), as if overwhelmed by the growth. The seed falls into *gen ten agathen* (the good earth) and produces *kar* (fruit) a hundredfold (*hekatonta*). This is the miracle of the receptive heart: the yield far exceeds the sowing. The Lord cries out (*ephonei*), demanding spiritual attention. Not all ears can hear this; only those circumcised by the Spirit.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
επηρωτων δε αυ οι μαθηται αυτου τιϲ αυτη ει η παραβολη

**English Translation**
And his disciples asked him, what this parable might be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples display the proper posture of the believer: inquiry. They do not assume they understand the *parabole*. They ask *tis aute ei* (what might this be). It is not shame to be ignorant of the mysteries, but it is shame to remain so when the Teacher is present. They seek the interpretation from the Author of the text.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ϋμιν δεδοται γνωναι ταϲ τα τα μυϲτηρια τηϲ βαϲιλειαϲ του τοιϲ δε λοιποιϲ παραβολαιϲ ϊνα βλεποντεϲ μη βλε και ακου · ακουωϲιν ακουωϲιν και μη ϲυνϊωϲιν

**English Translation**
And he said: To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of [God], but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not s[ee], and hearing they may hear and not understand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful distinction. To the disciples, knowledge is *dedotai* (given)—it is a gift of grace, not a conquest of intellect. They receive the *mysteria* (mysteries) of the Kingdom of *Tou* (God). But to the *loipois* (the rest), the parable serves as a judgment. The scribe’s repetition of *akouosin* (hearing) emphasizes the physical act of hearing without the spiritual result of understanding (*syniosin*). The Word hardens the proud while softening the humble.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
εϲτιν δε αυτη η πα ο ϲποροϲ εϲτιν ο λογοϲ του

**English Translation**
Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord provides the key. *He pa...* (The parable) is this: The seed is the *Logos Tou* (Word of God). The seed is small, yet it contains the whole potential of the plant. So too, the Word of God may seem slight—a mere sound in the air or marks on parchment—but within it dwells the infinite power of the Kingdom. It is not the word of man, but of the Divine.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
οι δε παρα την οδον ειϲιν οι α ειτα ερχεται ο διαβο και αιρει τον λογον απο τηϲ καρ αυτων ϊνα μη πιϲτευϲαντεϲ ϲωθωϲιν

**English Translation**
And those beside the way are those who h[eard]; then comes the devil and takes away the word from their heart, lest believing they might be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interpretation of the first soil. *Hoi a...* (those who heard). The enemy is identified as *ho diabo* (the devil). His tactic is theft: he *airei* (takes away) the Word immediately. Why? The purpose is explicit: *ina me... sothosin* (lest... they be saved). Faith comes by hearing, and salvation by faith. The devil knows that if the Word remains in the *kardias* (heart), salvation is imminent. Therefore, he snatches it before it can root.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
οι δε επι την πετρ τηϲ πετραϲ οι οταν ακουϲωϲ μετα χαραϲ δεχ τον λογον του και ουτοι ριζαν ου εχουϲιν οι προϲ καιρον πιϲτευουϲ και εν καιρω πι αφιϲταν

**English Translation**
And those upon the rock [of the rock] are they who, when they hear, with joy receive the word of [God], and these have no root; who for a time believe, and in time of [trial] fall away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s hesitation, writing *tēn petr tēs petras* ("the rock of the rock"), a stumbling in the hand that mirrors the stumbling of the soul described herein. These are the shallow hearts. They receive the *logon* (word) with immediate *charas* (joy), yet this joy is a fleeting vapor, not a solid foundation. The text omits the full name of God after *logon*, perhaps indicating how quickly the divine presence fades from the minds of the unstable. They lack *rizan* (root). Without the root of deep catechesis and penitence, the moisture of grace cannot be drawn up when the scorching sun of *pi* (temptation/trial) arrives. They stand *pros kairon* (for a season), but they do not stand forever.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
το δε ειϲ ταϲ ακαν πεϲον ουτοι ειϲιν οι ακουϲαν και ϋπο μερι και πλουτου και ηδονων του βιου πορευομενοι ϲυνπνιγονται κ(αι) ου τελεϲφορουϲιν

**English Translation**
And that which fell into the thorns, these are they who, having heard, and by cares and wealth and pleasures of life going forth are choked and do not bring fruit to perfection.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the tragedy of the divided heart. The seed falls, but it is surrounded by *akan* (thorns). Note the triad of destruction listed by the Evangelist: *meri* (cares/anxieties), *ploutou* (wealth), and *hēdonōn* (pleasures). These three strangle the breath of the soul. The word *sunpnigontai* (choked together) suggests a violent suffocation; the life of the world presses in so tightly that the life of the Spirit cannot breathe. The result is tragic: *ou telesphorousin*—they do not bring to an end. They are abortive in their virtue, producing a stalk but no grain. It is not enough to begin the journey; one must prune the thorns of luxury to reach the harvest.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
το δε εν τη καλη γη ουτοι ειϲιν οιτινεϲ οιτινεϲ οιτι εν καρδια κα και αγαθη ακου τον λογ λογ κατεχουϲιν και καρποφορουϲιν εν υπομονη

**English Translation**
But that in the good ground, these are they who [who who] in a heart [noble] and good, having heard the word [word], hold it fast and bear fruit in patience.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stutters here—*hoitines hoitines hoiti*—as if the scribe is overwhelmed by the multitude of the faithful, or perhaps trembling before the beauty of the "good ground." We see the requirements for fruitfulness: a heart that is *ka[lē]* (noble/beautiful) and *agathē* (good). It is not enough to hear; one must *katechousin* (hold it fast/possess it). The repetition of *log* (word) emphasizes that it is the Word alone they grasp. And the final condition is the hardest: *en hypomonē* (in patience/endurance). Fruit does not appear instantly; it requires the long suffering of the saints, waiting for the rain of the Spirit.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ουδειϲ δε λυχνον αψαϲ καλυπτι αυ ϲκευει η κλινηϲ τι αλλ επι την λυχνιαν τιθη ϊνα οι ειϲπο βλεπω το φωϲ

**English Translation**
And no one having lit a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts [it under] a bed, but places it upon the lampstand, that those entering may see the light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord moves from the soil to the *lychnon* (lamp). If you have received the seed, you become a light. It is absurd, says the Savior, to light a fire only to *kalypti* (cover) it. The *skeuei* (vessel) represents the business of the world, and the *klinēs* (bed) represents sloth and luxury. Neither work nor sleep should hide our confession. The purpose of the Christian life is public illumination: *hina hoi eispo blepō to phōs*—that those entering (the Church, the faith) may see the light. If your life is hidden, your lamp is extinguished.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ου γαρ εϲτιν κρυπτ κρυπτ ο ου φανερον γε ουδε α ο ου μη γνωϲθη και ειϲ φανερον ελθη

**English Translation**
For there is nothing hidden [hidden] which shall not become manifest, nor [secret] which shall not be known and come to light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying warning for the hypocrite. The text repeats *krypt* (hidden) twice, deepening the shadow of things concealed. But the light of judgment is penetrating. *Ou gar estin*—there is nothing that escapes God's eye. What is done in the dark corners of the heart, the *a* (likely *apokryphon*, secret things), will be dragged *eis phaneron* (into the open). For the righteous, this is a promise of vindication; for the sinner, a prophecy of shame. We must live as if our walls were made of glass.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
βλεπεται ουν πωϲ ακουεται οϲ αν γαρ εχη δοθηϲε αυτω και οϲ αν μη εχη και ο δοκει εχιν αρθηϲεται απ αυτου

**English Translation**
Take heed therefore how ye hear; for whosoever has, it shall be given to him, and whosoever has not, even what he seems to have shall be taken from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Blepetai* (Look/Take heed)! The command is urgent. The mystery of grace is inequitable to the human mind: to the possessor, more is given; from the destitute, even the semblance is stripped. *Ho dokei echin* (what he seems/thinks to have)—this is the phantom piety of the Pharisee. He thinks he possesses the Kingdom, but because he lacks the root (Verse 13) and is choked by thorns (Verse 14), even his external appearance of holiness *arthēsetai* (shall be lifted/taken away). Spiritual wealth is dynamic; if it does not grow, it vanishes.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
παρεγενοντο δε προϲ αυτον η μη αυτου και οι α αυτου και ουκ ηδυναντο ϲ αυτω δια τον οχλον

**English Translation**
And there came to him his mother and his [brothers], and they could not [reach] him because of the crowd.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The physical family of the Lord approaches. The scribe abbreviates *mētēr* (mother) and *adelphoi* (brothers) and the verb *syntychein* (to meet/reach), perhaps rushing to the spiritual lesson. They stand outside, blocked by the *ochlon* (crowd/multitude). This physical barrier serves as a sign: flesh and blood cannot inherently access the mysteries of the Kingdom. The crowd of worldly concerns and even human relations often stands between the soul and the Savior. One must press through the press.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
απηγγελη δε αυτω οτι η μητηρ και οι αδελφοι ϲου ε εξω ϊ ϲε θελοντεϲ

**English Translation**
And it was reported to him that thy mother and thy brothers [stand] outside wishing to [see] thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The message is delivered: *hē mētēr kai hoi adelphoi sou* (thy mother and thy brothers). They are *exō* (outside). In the topography of the Gospel, to be "outside" is a perilous position. They wish *idein* (to see) Him, but mere seeing is not enough; one must hear and do. The Lord is about to redefine kinship, shifting it from the blood of the patriarchs to the water of obedience.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει προϲ αυτουϲ μητηρ μου και α μου ουτοι ειϲιν οι τον λογον ακουοντεϲ και ποι

**English Translation**
But he answering said to them: My mother and my [brothers] are these who are hearing the word [of God] and doing [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the elevation of the faithful. He points to the disciples—those sitting in the "good ground." *Mētēr mou kai adelphoi mou* (My mother and my brothers) are defined by action, not lineage. The text abbreviates *poiountes* (doing), focusing on the active verb. It is the *hearing* and the *doing* of the *logon* (word) that generates kinship with Christ. By obedience, we become as close to Him as the womb that bore Him.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν μια τ ημερων κ(αι) αυτοϲ ενεβη ειϲ πλοιον και οι μαθηται αυτου και ειπεν προϲ αυ διελθωμεν ειϲ το περαν τηϲ λι και ανηχθη

**English Translation**
Now it came to pass on one of the days, [and] he entered into a boat and his disciples, and he said to them: Let us go over to the other side of the [lake]; and they launched forth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scene shifts to the waters. *Enebe eis ploion* (he embarked into a boat)—the Church is often likened to this ship, carrying the faithful across the abyss of the world. The command is *dielthōmen* (let us go through/over). He does not promise a calm journey, only a destination: *eis to peran* (to the other side). The scribe abbreviates *limnēs* (lake) and *anēchthēsan* (they set sail), hurrying us toward the tempest. We must embark with Him, leaving the solid earth of our comfort.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
πλεοντων δε αυτ αυτ αφυπνωϲεν και κατεβη λαιλαψʼ ανε ειϲ την λιμν και ϲυνεπληρουν και εκινδυνευ

**English Translation**
But as they sailed he fell asleep; and there came down a storm [of wind] into the [lake], and they were filling [with water] and were in danger.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Aphypnōsen* (he fell asleep). The Lord sleeps in his humanity, yet watches in his divinity. While He rests, the *lailaps* (whirlwind/storm) descends. The text stammers *aut aut* (them them), perhaps reflecting the trembling of the disciples. The boat *syneplyroun* (was being filled together)—the waters of chaos seeking to swallow the vessel of salvation. *Ekindyneu* (they were in danger/peril). It is a test of faith: does the sleeping Christ still command the elements? The soul often feels God is asleep during its tribulations.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
προϲελθοντεϲ δε διηγειραν αυτον λεγοντεϲ επιϲτα επιϲτατα επιϲτατα απολ ο δε διεγερθειϲ επε τω ανε και του τω κλυδω του και επαυϲατο και εγενε γαληνη

**English Translation**
And coming to him they woke him saying: Master, Master, Master, we perish! And he having arisen rebuked the [wind] and the [surge of the water]; and it ceased, and there was a calm.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Look at the panic in the ink! *Epista, epistata, epistata*—three times the cry rings out in this manuscript, where usually we find but two. The terror is palpable; *apollumetha* (we are perishing)! They wake Him, not with faith in His power, but in fear of death. But He, *diegertheis* (having been aroused), speaks to the elements as a master to a servant. He rebukes the *anemō* (wind) and the *klydōni* (surge/billow). The result is instant: *egeneto galēnē* (there became a calm). The chaos of the world cannot withstand the waking Word of God. Let us not fear when the boat fills, for the Master is on board.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτοιϲ που η πιϲτιϲ ϋμων οι δε φοβηθεντεϲ εθαυ λεγοντεϲ τιϲ αρα ουτοϲ εϲτιν οτι και τοιϲ ανεμοιϲ επιταϲϲει και τω ϋδατι και υπακουου αυτω

**English Translation**
But he said to them, "Where is your faith?" But having feared, they marveled, saying, "Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the Lord’s interrogation of the soul: "Where is your faith?" He does not ask *if* they have it, but *where* it has been misplaced during the tempest. The text here exhibits a curious truncation in *εθαυ* (likely *ethaumasan*, "they marveled"), as if the scribe himself was cut short by the sudden stillness of the sea. The disciples' fear shifts from the storm to the Master. The final verb *υπακουου* (obey) lacks its final letters, yet the elements' obedience is complete; nature hears what the scribe barely finishes writing.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και κατε κατεπλευϲαν ειϲ την χωραν των γεργε ητιϲ εϲτ εϲτ αντιπερα τηϲ γα

**English Translation**
And they sailed down [sailed down] to the country of the Gerge[senes], which is [is] opposite Ga[lilee].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reveals a turbulent arrival. The repetition *κατε κατεπλευϲαν* ("sailed down, sailed down") mimics the stuttering motion of the boat or the hesitation of the writer. The destination is identified specifically as *γεργε* (Gergesenes), distinct from the Gadarenes found in other traditions, locating this miracle precisely in the Gentile territories. The text is fraught with duplication (*εϲτ εϲτ*) and abbreviation (*γα* for Galilee), suggesting a haste to reach the confrontation that awaits on the shore.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
εξελθοντι δε αυτω επι την γην ϋπην ανηρ τιϲ εκ τηϲ πολεωϲ ε οϲ ειχεν δαιμονια και χρονω ϊκανω εκ χρονων ϊκαν και χρονω ϊκανω ουκ ενεδυϲατο ϊμα κ(αι) ϊματιον ουκ ενεδυϲατο ουκ ενεδυϲατο ϊματιον και εν οικια ουκ εμενεν αλλ εν τοιϲ μνημαϲιν

**English Translation**
And as he went out upon the land, there met [him] a certain man from the city, who had demons, and for a considerable time [from considerable times] and for a considerable time he did not put on a garment [and a garment he did not put on, he did not put on a garment], and he did not remain in a house but in the tombs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the chaos of the demonic manifest in the very letters of the Codex. The scribe falls into a delirious repetition, writing "for a considerable time" and "did not put on a garment" three distinct times in varying orders. This textual disorder mirrors the fractured mind of the demoniac. He belongs to the city (*poleōs*), yet lives in the tombs (*mnēmasin*); he is a man, yet stripped of the dignity of clothing (*imati*). The text struggles to describe his nakedness, circling the shame of it repeatedly.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε τον α προϲε αυτω και φωνη μεγαλη ει τι εμοι και ϲοι ϋϊε του του ϋ δαιομε ϲου μη με βαϲανιϲηϲ

**English Translation**
But seeing the [Jesus], he fell before him and with a loud voice said, "What to me and to you, Son of the [the] Most High? I beg you, do not torment me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demon recognizes what men do not. The title is abbreviated to *Hu* (Most High), acknowledging the supreme authority of the Christ. The text reads *prose* (likely *prosepesen*, fell before), indicating a collapse into submission. The demon cries out against "torment" (*basanisiēs*), revealing that the mere presence of Holiness is agony to the unclean. The repetition of the article *tou tou* before the divine title emphasizes the specificity of Christ's sonship.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
παρηγγελλεν γαρ τω π π τω ακαθαρ εξελθειν απο του ανθρωπου πολ γαρ χρονοιϲ ϲυ αυτον και εδεϲμευετο αλυϲεϲιν και παι φυλαϲϲομενοϲ κ(αι) κ(αι) διαρρηϲϲων τα δεμονια δεϲμα δεϲμα ηλαυνε ϋπο του δαιμο ειϲ ταϲ ερη

**English Translation**
For he commanded the [spirit] the unclean to come out from the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was bound with chains and fetters, being guarded, and [and] breaking the bonds [bonds] he was driven by the demon into the deserts.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The struggle is palpable. The text stutters on the spirit (*p p* for *pneumati*), as if resisting the command. We see a correction or confusion in *demonia desma desma*: initially writing "demonic bonds," then correcting to simply "bonds." This is profound: the chains of men were indeed demonic bonds to this sufferer. He is driven into the *erē* (deserts/desolate places), the anti-Eden where life cannot flourish, until the Word commands his release.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
επηρωτη δε αυτον ο τι ϲοι ονομα εϲτιν ο δε ειπεν λεγι λεγαι οτι ειϲηλθεν δαι πολλα ειϲ αυ

**English Translation**
But the [Jesus] asked him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Legi[on]," because many demons had entered into him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord demands a name to define the enemy. The response in the Codex is *Legi Legai*—a struggle to transliterate the Latin military term *Legion*. This indicates a foreign, occupying force within the soul, a multitude (*polla*) usurping the singular vessel. The text abbreviates the subject *o* (He/Jesus) and the demons *dai*, stripping them of full recognition while the reality of the possession is laid bare.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
και παρεκαλουν αυτον ϊνα μη ε αυτοιϲ ειϲ την αβυϲϲον α

**English Translation**
And they begged him that he would not [command] them to go away into the abyss.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demons fear the *Abysson*—the bottomless depth, the primordial chaos from which order was separated. The text is sharply abbreviated here: *e* stands for *epitaxē* (command) and *a* for *apelthein* (to go away). It is a hurried plea. They prefer the swine, or the earth, to the finality of the Abyss, acknowledging Christ holds the keys to their eternal prison.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ην δε εκει αγελη χοιρων ϊκαν ϊκαν βοϲκομενη εν τω ορει και παρεκαλουν παρεκαλεϲαν παρεκαλουν αυ ϊνα επιτρεψη αυτοιϲ ειϲ εκεινουϲ ειϲελθειν και ε αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
Now there was there a herd of considerable [considerable] swine feeding in the mountain; and they begged [begged, begged] him that he would permit them to enter into those; and he permitted them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The intensity of the demons' desire is marked by the scribe's triple repetition: *parekaloun parekalesan parekaloun* ("they begged, they begged, they begged"). They are desperate for embodiment, even in unclean beasts. The herd is described as *hikan hikan* ("considerable considerable"), emphasizing the vast number required to house the Legion. Christ's permission (*e*) is a judgment: he allows the unclean to go to the unclean.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
εξελθοντα δε τα δαιμονια απο του ανθρωπου ει ειϲ τουϲ χοιρουϲ και ωρμη η αγγελη αγελη αγελη κατα του κρημνου ειϲ την θαλαϲϲαν κ(αι) απεπνιγη

**English Translation**
And the demons having gone out from the man entered [entered] into the swine, and the herd [herd, herd] rushed down the steep place into the sea and was drowned.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The transfer of chaos is immediate. The scribe repeats *agelē agelē agelē* ("herd herd herd"), visually and aurally replicating the stampede of the beasts. They rush down the precipice into the sea (*thalassan*). Note the irony: the water which Christ calmed in verse 25 now acts as the instrument of judgment, swallowing the Legion. The demons sought to avoid the Abyss, yet they are choked in the depths of the sea.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ϊδοντεϲ δε οι βοϲκ το γεγονοϲ ε και απηγγι ειϲ την πολιν και ειϲ τουϲ αγρουϲ

**English Translation**
But the herdsmen, seeing what had happened, fled and reported [it] into the city and into the fields.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The witnesses are the *bosk* (herdsmen), guardians of the unclean economy. Their reaction is flight (*e* for *ephugon*). They do not marvel like the disciples; they run. They spread the report (*apēggi*) to the centers of human habitation (city) and the rural outskirts (fields), ensuring the testimony of Christ's power covers the entire geography of the Gerasenes.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθον δε ϊδιν το γεγονοϲ και ηλθον προϲ τον και ευρον καθημε τον ανθρω αφ ου τα δαι εξηλθεν εξηλθον ϊματιϲμενον κ(αι) ϲωφρονουντα παρα τουϲ ποδαϲ του και εφοβη ·

**English Translation**
And they went out to see what had happened, and they came to the [Jesus], and found the man from whom the demons had gone out [gone out] sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of the [Jesus], and they were afraid.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the tableau of salvation. The man is found *kathēme* (sitting) and *imati* (clothed)—a direct reversal of his restless, naked state in verse 27. The text emphasizes the exorcism by repeating *exēlthen exēlthon* ("gone out, gone out"). He sits "at the feet" of the Lord, the posture of a disciple. The name of Jesus is omitted (*pros ton*... *podas tou*), yet the center of the scene is unmistakably Him. The crowd's reaction is fear (*ephobē*), for holiness is as terrifying to the worldly as it is to the demonic.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
απηγγει δε λεγοντεϲ αυτοιϲ οι ϊδοντεϲ πωϲ εϲωθη ο δε δαιμονιϲθειϲ

**English Translation**
And those who had seen it reported to them how the one possessed by demons was saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter of the storm and the Legion concludes with the word *esōthē* (was saved). The report is not merely of a cure, but of salvation. The scribe writes *o de daimonistheis* (the but demon-possessed one), perhaps a slip for *ho* (the), yet it highlights the transformation: the one who *was* possessed is now the evidence of God's saving power. The narrative moves from the danger of the sea to the danger of the soul, and in both, Christ is the Victor.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και ηρωτηϲεν αυ παν το πλη τηϲ περιχω των γεργεϲη γαδαρηνων γεργεϲηνων απελθιν α αυτων οτι φο μεγαλω ϲυνϊ αυτοϲ δε εμβαϲ ειϲ πλοιον επεϲτρε ϲυνεϲτρεψεν υπεϲτρεψεν

**English Translation**
And asked Him all the multitude of the surrounding region of the Gergesenes [Gadarenes/Gergesenes] to depart from them, because with great fear they were seized; but He, having embarked into a boat, returned [turned together/returned].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the tumult not only of the populace but of the very scribe's hand. The text wavers between *Gergesenes* and *Gadarenes*, correcting itself thrice, mirroring the confusion of a people who prefer their swine to the Savior. They are seized (`ϲυνϊ` for *syneichonto*) by fear, not faith. The Lord, rejected, does not force His presence; the corrected verb `υπεϲτρεψεν` (returned) confirms His departure. It is a fearful judgment when God grants the sinner’s request to leave him alone.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
εδεετο εδειτο εδετο δε αυ ο ανηρ αφ ου εξεληλυθει τα δαι ειναι ϲυ αυτω απελυϲεν δε αυτ αυτ λεγων

**English Translation**
But begged [begged/begged] Him the man from whom had gone out the demons to be with Him; but He dismissed him [him], saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles with the spelling of "begged" (`εδεετο εδειτο εδετο`), emphasizing the intensity of the man's plea. This man, formerly possessed, now desires the highest good: `ειναι ϲυ αυτω` (to be with Him). Yet, the Lord exercises a severe mercy. He dismisses the man (`απελυϲεν`), not from love, but for mission. To sit at Jesus' feet is sweet, but to obey His command to go is necessary. The repetition of `αυτ` (him) underscores the personal nature of this dismissal.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
ϋποϲτρε ειϲ τον οικον ϲου και διηγου ο ϲοι εποιηϲεν ο και απηλθεν καθ ο την πολιν κη οϲα εποι αυτω ο

**English Translation**
Return into your house and recount what things for you did [God]; and he went away throughout the whole city proclaiming as many things as did for him [Jesus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound Christological truth is embedded in the grammar. The Lord commands the man to tell what *God* (`ο` [Theos]) did; the man goes and proclaims what *Jesus* (`ο` [Iesous]) did. The Evangelist thereby equates the works of Jesus with the works of God. The mission begins in the `οικον` (house) but spills into the `πολιν` (city). We see here that true gratitude cannot be silent; the cured soul becomes a herald (`κη` for *kerysson*).

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε εν εν δε εγενετο δε εν τω τ τ απεδεξατο αυ ο οχλοϲ ηϲαν γαρ παντεϲ προϲ τον αυτον

**English Translation**
And it came to pass [and in/and it came to pass] in the [returning]... welcomed Him the crowd; for they were all [waiting for] Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is rugged, with the scribe stuttering over the phrase `εγενετο δε` (and it came to pass), repeating it as if in anticipation. Unlike the Gerasenes who begged Him to depart, this crowd on the opposite shore is defined by expectation (`προϲ τον` implies *prosdokontes*). The heart that waits for Christ welcomes Christ. The reception of the Word depends entirely upon the preparation of the soil.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ηλθεν α ω ονομα ϊαει και αυτοϲ αρ τηϲ ϲυναγω ϋπηρχεν και πεϲων παρα τουϲ ποδαϲ του παρεκα αυτον ειϲελθ ειϲελθ ειϲ τον οικον αυτου

**English Translation**
And behold came a man to whom the name Jaei[rus], and he a ruler of the synagogue was, and falling at the feet of [Jesus] besought Him to enter [enter] into his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Dignity bows to Divinity. Jairus (`ϊαει`), a ruler (`αρ` for *archon*), forgets his station and falls at the feet of the Galilean. The scribe repeats `ειϲελθ` (enter), capturing the frantic urgency of a father. Even the synagogue, often hostile, must kneel when death knocks at the door. He begs Jesus to enter his house, knowing that where the Light enters, darkness must flee.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
οτι θυγατηρ μονο ην αυτω ωϲ ε δωδεκα και αυτη απεθνη ˙ εν δε τω αυτον οι οχλοι ϲυνεπνιγ αυτον

**English Translation**
Because a daughter only was to him about years twelve, and she was dying. And in the [going] of Him the crowds were choking Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The pathos is sharp: `θυγατηρ μονο` (only daughter), aged twelve—the very threshold of womanhood—now `απεθνη` (was dying). Contrast the delicate life fading with the brutal crush of the mob (`ϲυνεπνιγ`, choking/thronging). The world presses in on the Lord with curiosity and noise, while a single life hangs in the balance. The Lord moves through the suffocating crowd, focused on the individual need.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και γυνη ου εν ρυϲει αιμα απο ετων δω ητιϲ ϊατροιϲ προϲα ολον τον βιον εαυτηϲ και ουκ ϊϲχυϲεν ϋπ ουδνενοϲ ο̣υ̣δ̣ε̣ϲ̣θ̣ενοϲ ϋπ ουδενοϲ θε

**English Translation**
And a woman being in a flow of blood from years twelve, who on physicians having spent her whole livelihood, and could not by no one [no one] be healed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the twin misery to Jairus's daughter: twelve years of living death to match twelve years of life. The Codex explicitly includes that she spent her "whole livelihood" (`ολον τον βιον`), a phrase some manuscripts omit. The scribe struggles mightily with the negation `ουδνενοϲ` (by no one), writing and rewriting, emphasizing the utter failure of human aid. Where human skill (`ϊατροιϲ`) ends and poverty begins, there divine grace finds its opportunity.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
προϲ οπιϲθεν ηψατο του κραϲπε του ϊματιου αυτου · και παραχρημα ε η ρυϲιϲ του αι αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
Approaching from behind touched the fringe of His garment; and immediately stopped the flow of her blood.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She approaches `οπιϲθεν` (from behind), driven by shame and ritual impurity, daring only to touch the `κραϲπε` (fringe)—the border of the law which she could not fulfill. Yet, power resides not in the garment but in the contact of faith. `Παραχρημα` (immediately) the flow stopped (`ε` for *estē*). Grace does not delay; it acts the moment the soul makes contact, however imperfectly.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ο τιϲ ο αψαμενοϲ μου αρ δε π ειπεν ο πετροϲ και οι ϲυν αυτω ε οι οχλοι ϲυ ϲε και αποθλιβουϲιν

**English Translation**
And said [Jesus]: Who is the one having touched Me? Denying but all, said Peter and those with him: [Master], the crowds press You and squeeze.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord asks not for information, but for confession. "Who touched Me?" Peter, ever the pragmatist, sees only the physical crush (`ϲυ ϲε`, pressing/holding together). He cannot distinguish between the accidental bump of the crowd and the deliberate touch of faith. The world presses against Christ daily but receives nothing; only the touch of specific faith draws out virtue.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ηψατο μου τιϲ εγω γαρ ε δυναμιν ε απ ε ·

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] said: Touched Me someone; for I knew power having gone out from Me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord corrects the Apostle. It was not a crowd; it was a "someone" (`τιϲ`). He perceives `δυναμιν` (power) going out. This teaches us that the gifts of God are not given without cost to the Giver; there is an expenditure of divine sympathy. The miracle is a transaction of life: her weakness for His power.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
ϊδουϲα δε η γυνη οτι ουκ ελαθεν τρεμουϲα ηλθεν και προϲπεϲουϲα αυτω διηγγειλεν ε παντοϲ του λαου και ωϲ ειαθη παραχρημα

**English Translation**
Seeing but the woman that she was not hidden, trembling came and falling before Him declared before all the people [for what cause she touched] and how she was healed immediately.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Faith cannot remain a secret (`ουκ ελαθεν`). She desired a stolen blessing, but Christ desires a public daughter. She comes `τρεμουϲα` (trembling), fearing rebuke for her impurity, but she confesses `ε παντοϲ του λαου` (before all the people). This public testimony is necessary not for the healing of her body—which was already done—but for the healing of her conscience and her social restoration.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν θυγατερ η πιϲτιϲ ϲου ϲεϲω ϲε πορευου ει ειρηνην

**English Translation**
But He said: Daughter, your faith has saved you; go into peace.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He does not call her "Woman," but `Θυγατερ` (Daughter). She who had no family and was an outcast is now claimed by God. He attributes the miracle to her: "Your faith has saved you" (`ϲεϲω ϲε`). Note the verb is not merely "healed" but "saved" (sozo). She sought health; she found salvation. The command `πορευου ει ειρηνην` (go into peace) seals her restoration—not just a cessation of trouble, but an entrance into the peace of God.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
ετι αυτου λαλουν ερχεται τιϲ πα του αρχιϲυναγω λεγων οτι τε η θυγα ϲου μηκετι ϲκυλ τον διδαϲκαλον

**English Translation**
While he was still speaking, someone comes from the ruler of the synagogue saying that your daughter has [died]; do not bother the teacher any longer.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the cruelty of the timing: *eti autou laloun* (while he was still speaking). The healing of the woman with the issue of blood is interrupted by the tidings of death. The messenger uses the abbreviated *te* (for *tethnēken*, has died) and the harsh command *mēketi skyl* (do not bother/vex). The world views the Master merely as a *didaskalon* (teacher) whose utility ends at the grave. They believe death is the final boundary which instruction cannot cross. They seek to spare the Teacher labor, not knowing He is the Lord of Life who labors not to raise the dead, but does so by mere will.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ακουϲαϲ ειπεν απεκριθη αυτω μη φοβου μονον πιϲτευε και ϲωθηϲεται

**English Translation**
But he, hearing, said [and] answered him: Do not fear; only believe, and she shall be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe records a double verb of utterance, *eipen apekrithē* (said, answered), emphasizing the deliberate nature of Christ’s reply. He ignores the messenger and addresses the father. The command is twofold: negative (*mē phobou*, do not fear) and positive (*monon pisteue*, only believe). The promise *sōthēsetai* (she shall be saved) carries the dual weight of physical resuscitation and spiritual salvation. Where the messenger saw a corpse, the Word sees a vessel ready for deliverance. Faith is the only requirement to bridge the gap between death and life.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
ελ δε ειϲ την οι ουδενα αφη ϲυνειϲελθε αυτω ει μη πετρον και και ϊωαννην και τον πατερα τηϲ παιδοϲ και την μη

**English Translation**
But coming into the house, he allowed no one to enter with him except Peter and and John and the father of the child and the mother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see here the separation of the profane crowd from the sacred mystery. He enters the *oi* (house, *oikian*), but restricts the witnesses. In this specific Codex, we observe a textual curiosity: the reading *Petron kai kai Iōannēn* (Peter and and John). The double conjunction *kai* binds the apostles, yet the text before us omits the name of James, listing only Peter and John alongside the parents. We must read what is written: the testimony here rests upon the Rock (Peter) and the Beloved (John), and the natural parents. It is a gathering of faith and love, necessary conditions for the revelation of glory.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
εκλαιον δε παντεϲ και εκοπτοντο αυ · ο δε ειπεν μη κλαιετε ου γαρ α αλλα καθευδει

**English Translation**
And all were weeping and beating themselves [for] her; but he said: Do not weep, for she has not [died], but sleeps.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tumult of the mourners, who *ekoptanto* (were beating their breasts), stands in stark contrast to the calm of the Lord. He redefines the state of the girl. The scribe abbreviates the grim reality of death to a single letter *a* (for *apethanen*), as if to minimize its power in the presence of Christ. To the Lord, death is but *katheudei* (sleep), a temporary state from which one can be awakened. This is not a denial of biological cessation, but a theological assertion of His authority over the soul.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
και κα αυτου ει οτι απεθα

**English Translation**
And they laughed at him, knowing that she had died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the collision between carnal knowledge and divine power. The crowd *kategelōn* (laughed down/derided, abbreviated *ka*), because they possessed the empirical evidence *eidotes* (knowing, abbreviated *ei*) that she was dead (*apethanen*). The world mocks what it cannot measure. They trust their eyes more than the Word of God. This laughter is the sound of foolishness confronting Wisdom; they know death, but they do not know the Resurrection and the Life standing before them.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ δε κρα τηϲ χειροϲ αυτηϲ εφωνηϲ λεγων η παιϲ εγει

**English Translation**
But he, holding her hand, called out saying: Child, arise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ does not fear ritual defilement from the corpse. *Autos de* (But he) acts in opposition to the mockers. He engages in physical contact, *kratēsas* (holding, abbreviated *kra*) her hand. This touch connects the Life-giver to the lifeless. He speaks the command *egeire* (arise/wake up). He addresses her as *hē pais* (the child), calling her personhood back from the abyss. It is not a spell, but a summons. The Creator calls to the creature, and the creature must obey.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
και επεϲτρεψ το π αυτηϲ ανεϲτη παραχρημα κ(αι) ανεϲτη παραχρημα και διεταξεν αυτη δο φαγειν

**English Translation**
And her spirit returned, [and] she rose immediately and she rose immediately, and he ordered [something] be given to her to eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the miracle in the text and the transcription! The *pneuma* (spirit, abbreviated *p*) returns (*epestrepsen*). The soul re-inhabits the body. The manuscript here contains a striking repetition: *anestē parachrēma kai anestē parachrēma* (she rose immediately and she rose immediately). Whether a scribal error or a stammer of amazement, the duplication serves to doubly confirm the reality of the resurrection. She did not linger; she rose *at once*. To prove this was no phantom, He commands she be given to eat (*phagein*). The spiritual return is validated by physical hunger.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
και εξεϲτηϲαν οι γο αυτηϲ ο δε παρηγγειλεν αυ μηδενι ειπ ειπ το γεγονοϲ

**English Translation**
And her parents were amazed; but he charged them to tell to tell no one what had happened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The parents (*goneis*, abbreviated *go*) are seized with ecstasy (*exestēsan*). Yet, the Lord imposes the discipline of silence. He charges them *mēdeni* (to no one) to speak of the event. The text again shows a stutter in the command: *eip eip* (to tell, to tell). He seals the miracle within the house. Why? Because faith must not rest on the spectacle of signs alone, but on the person of Christ. The miracle is for the comfort of the parents and the instruction of the disciples, not for the entertainment of the scoffers who were cast out.
