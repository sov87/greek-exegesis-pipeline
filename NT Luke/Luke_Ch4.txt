**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
δε πληρηϲ αγιου υπεϲτρεψεν απο του ϊορ και ηγετο εν τω εν τη ερημω

**English Translation**
And [he], full of [the] Holy [Spirit], returned from the Jordan and was led in the... in the wilderness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the immediate sequence: the water of the Jordan is followed by the fire of the trial. The scribe’s hesitation—writing "in the" (*en tō*) and then correcting to "in the wilderness" (*en tē erēmō*)—mirrors the mystery of the Spirit's leading. He is "full" (*plērēs*) of the Holy One; thus, He does not go into the desert to become holy, but to manifest holiness against the desolation. He is led passively (*ēgeto*), showing the submission of the Son to the economy of the Spirit, entering the contest not by presumption but by divine compulsion.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ημεραϲ πειραζομενοϲ του διαβολου και ουκ εφαγεν ου ουδεν εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ εκειναιϲ και ϲυντελεϲθιϲ αυτων επιναϲ

**English Translation**
...days, being tempted by the [agent] of the devil. And he ate not... nothing in those days; and [when] they were concluded, he hungered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text omits the number forty, yet the duration is felt in the agony of the abstinence. The double negative (*ouk... ouden*) emphasizes the absolute nature of His fast; He partook of no earthly sustenance, that He might feed on the will of the Father. That "he hungered" (*epinas*) at the end proves He was no phantom, as the heretics claim, but truly bore the heavy burden of the flesh. The adversary waits until the moment of greatest physical weakness to strike, for the devil attacks where the wall is breached.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτω ο διαβολοϲ ει ι ει του ειπε τω λιθω τουτω ϊνα γενη αρτοϲ

**English Translation**
And the devil said to him: If [Son] you are of the [God], speak to this stone that it might become bread.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tempter strikes at His identity. The abbreviated text (*ei i ei tou*) suggests the question "If you are the Son..." The challenge is not merely to satisfy hunger, but to misuse divine sonship for carnal relief. He points to a "stone," mocking the Creator to turn the very rocks of the wilderness into luxury. It is the temptation to command creation for self-service rather than for the glory of the One who made it.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθη απεκριθη προϲ αυτον ο γεγρα οτι ουκ επ αρ μονω ζηϲε ο ανθρωποϲ

**English Translation**
And answered... answered him [Jesus]: It is written that not on bread alone shall the man live.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stumbles (*apokrithē apekrithē*), as if trembling at the Lord’s rebuke. The Lord does not argue with his own authority but wields the sword of the Spirit: "It is written" (*gegraptai*). He defines "the man" (*o anthrōpos*) not as a belly to be filled, but as a being sustained by the Word. He vindicates the nature of Adam, showing that true life is not found in the loaf, but in the Law of God.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και αναγαγων αυ ειϲ οροϲ υψηλον εδιξεν αυτω παϲαϲ ταϲ βαϲιλι τηϲ οικουμε εν ϲτιγμη χρονου

**English Translation**
And having led him up into a high mountain, he showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited world in a moment of time.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The adversary elevates Him to cast Him down. The vision of the "inhabited world" (*oikoumenēs*) is granted in a "point" or "puncture" of time (*en stigmē chronou*). This reveals the nature of worldly glory: it is a fleeting phantom, a mere dot in eternity. The devil displays the kingdoms not to give them, but to ensnare the King of Kings with a mirage of power that fades as quickly as it appears.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και ειπ ειπ αυτω ο διαβολοϲ ϲοι δωϲω την ε ταυτην παϲαν και την δο αυτων οτι ε παραδεδοται και ῶ εαν θελω δωϲω διδωμι διδωμι αυτην

**English Translation**
And said... said to him the devil: To you I will give all this [authority] and the [glory] of them, because to me it has been delivered, and to whomsoever I wish, I will give... I give... I give it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering of the text (*didōmi didōmi* - "I give, I give") betrays the desperation of the liar. He claims the authority (*exousian*) and glory (*doxan*) are his to grant, a usurper claiming the throne. He boasts that it "has been delivered" to him, acknowledging that even his power is permitted, not inherent. He offers the crown without the cross, a transaction of sovereignty for submission, repeating his offer as if to force the Divine Will to bend.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ϲυ ουν εαν προϲκυ μοι ενω εμου ενωπιον μου εϲτε ϲου παϲα

**English Translation**
You therefore, if you worship [me]... before me... in my presence, it shall be yours, all [of it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the naked ambition of the fallen archangel: he desires worship (*proskunēsēs*). The scribal correction from "before me" (*enō emou*) to "in my presence" (*enōpion mou*) highlights the intimacy of the idolatry demanded. He offers "all" (*pasa*)—the totality of the world—in exchange for a single act of apostasy. He seeks to place the Creator on his knees before the creature.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και απο ο ειπ αυτω γεγραπται τον ϲου προϲκυνηϲειϲ και αυτω μονω λατρευϲειϲ

**English Translation**
And answering, [Jesus] said to him: It is written, The [Lord] your [God] you shall worship, and him only shall you serve.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord cuts the knot of temptation with the blade of Deuteronomy. The text is elliptical (*ton sou* - "the your"), implying the Holy Name which the scribe dares not fully write. By saying "Him only shall you serve" (*latreuseis*), Christ establishes the order of the cosmos. Worship is not a bargaining chip for power; it is the exclusive right of the Divine. He defeats the pride of the devil with the humility of the law.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ηγαγ δε αυτον ειϲ ϊερου και εϲτη επι το πτερυ του ϊερου και ειπεν αυτω ει υϊοϲ ει του βα ϲεαυτον εντευ κατω

**English Translation**
And he led him into Jerusalem, and set [him] upon the wing of the temple, and said to him: If Son you are of the [God], cast yourself from here down.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
From the mountain of idolatry to the pinnacle of the sanctuary (*ierou*). The devil now tempts within the holy city, using the very structures of religion. He challenges the Sonship again (*ei uios ei*), urging a spectacle of miraculous preservation. To "cast yourself down" is to test the Father's love by manufacturing a crisis. It is the temptation of spiritual pride: to force God to act on our terms.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
γεγρα γαρ γαρ οτι τοιϲ αγγε αυτου εντε περι ϲου του διαφυλαξαι ϲε

**English Translation**
For it is written... for: That to his angels he will give command concerning thee, to guard thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The enemy now quotes Scripture, twisting the Psalter (Psalm 90) to his ends. The repetition (*gar gar* - "for for") underscores the insistence of the assault. He omits the phrase "in all thy ways," for the way of presumption is not the way of the Lord. He attempts to use the promise of angelic guardianship (*aggelois*) to justify a suicidal leap, turning a promise of safety into a trap of testing.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και οτι επι χειρων αρουϲιν ϲε μηπο προϲκοψηϲ προϲ λιθον τον ποδα ϲου ·

**English Translation**
And that upon hands they shall bear thee up, lest thou strike against a stone thy foot.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He continues the citation. The "stone" (*lithon*) returns, linking the first temptation of bread to this final test of trust. The devil suggests that the Messiah should be carried by angels rather than walk the dusty road of the Incarnation. He desires a Christ who floats above human suffering, untouched by the "stones" of the earth. But our Lord came to walk, to suffer, and to bleed, not to be borne aloft in empty spectacle.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ει αυτω ο οτι οτι ει ουκ εκπιρα τον ϲου

**English Translation**
And answering, [Jesus] said to him... that... that it is said: You shall not tempt the [Lord] your [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final word. The text stammers (*oti oti*), but the command is clear: "You shall not tempt" (*ouk ekpeiraseis*). Jesus refuses to put the Father to the proof. True faith does not demand evidence; it rests in obedience. By refusing to jump, He stands firm on the pinnacle of righteousness. He silences the devil not by a display of power, but by the quiet strength of submission to the Divine order. The "Lord your God" is to be trusted, not tested.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και ϲυντελεϲαϲ παντα πιραϲμον ο διαβολοϲ απεϲτη απ αυτου αχρι και

**English Translation**
And having concluded every temptation, the devil departed from him until a [season].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the precision of the struggle: the adversary does not merely cease, but waits until the temptation is *ϲυντελεϲαϲ* (fully concluded). The devil's departure is not a surrender, but a strategic retreat *αχρι και* (until a time). The spiritual combat is not a single battle but a siege; when the enemy withdraws, it is only to regroup for the Passion.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και ϋπεϲτρε ο εν τη δυνα του ειϲ τ τ γαλιλαιαν και φη εξηλθεν καθ ο τηϲ χωραϲ πε αυτου

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] returned in the power of the [Spirit] into the Galilee; and a report went out through the whole region concerning him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The wilderness does not deplete the Lord; it empowers Him. He returns *εν τη δυνα* (in the power), illustrating that fasting and struggle against the tempter generate spiritual authority. The *φη* (report/fame) spreads not by human artifice, but by the ontological weight of holiness which cannot be hidden.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ εδιδαϲκεν εν ταιϲ ϲυναγωγαιϲ αυτ δοξαζομενοϲ ϋπο παντων

**English Translation**
And he himself was teaching in their synagogues, being glorified by all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the brief season of acceptance. *Αυτοϲ* (He Himself) is the active agent of instruction within the established order (*ϲυναγωγαιϲ*). That He is *δοξαζομενοϲ* (glorified) by all serves as a tragic prelude to the rejection that follows; the crowd's glory is as shifting as the sand, while God's glory is eternal.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και ηλθεν ειϲ ναζαρα ου ην ανατεθραμ και ειϲηλ κατα το ειωθοϲ αυτω εν τη ημε των ϲαββατ ειϲ την ϲυναγω και ανεϲτη αναγνωναι

**English Translation**
And he came into Nazara, where he had been nurtured, and he entered according to his custom on the day of the Sabbaths into the synagogue, and stood up to read.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the humility of the Incarnation: the Creator allows Himself to be *ανατεθραμ* (nurtured/reared) by His creatures in a specific place, *Ναζαρα*. He submits to the Law and custom (*ειωθοϲ*), honoring the Sabbath. He stands (*ανεϲτη*) as a servant to the Word, though He is the Word itself.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και ε αυτω βι του προφη ηϲαϊου και α το βι ευρεν το ου ην γεγραμ

**English Translation**
And was given to him [the] book of the prophet Isaiah; and [having unrolled] the book he found the place where it was written:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Providence directs the liturgy. The scroll (*βι*) is handed to Him, but He actively *ευρεν* (found) the locus. He did not read at random; the selection was deliberate. The Old Covenant (*ηϲαϊου*) is opened to reveal the New.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
επ εμε ου εινεκ εχριϲεν με ευαγγε πτωχοιϲ απεϲταλκεν με κη αιχμαλωτοιϲ αφεϲιν και τυφλοιϲ αναβλεψιν αποϲτι τεθραυϲμενουϲ εν αφεϲι

**English Translation**
[The Spirit is] upon me, on account of which he anointed me to preach good news to the poor; he has sent me to proclaim release to captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to send forth the crushed in release,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the charter of the Kingdom. The anointing (*εχριϲεν*) confirms Him as the Christ. His mission is downward-focused: to the *πτωχοιϲ* (poor), the *αιχμαλωτοιϲ* (captives), and the *τυφλοιϲ* (blind). The repetition of *αφεϲιν* (release/remission) signals the true Jubilee—not merely of debt, but of sin.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
κηρυξαι ενιαυτον δεκτ

**English Translation**
To proclaim [the] acceptable year [of the Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *ενιαυτον* (year) is the Kairos, the moment of divine intervention. It is *δεκτ* (acceptable) because the Son is present to mediate it. The time of waiting is over; the time of favor is now.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και πτυξαϲ το βιβλι αποδουϲ τω ϋπη εκαθιϲεν και παντων οι οφθαλ εν τη ϲυναγω ηϲαν ατενιζον αυτω

**English Translation**
And having folded the book, having given it back to the attendant, he sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were gazing at him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tension is palpable in the silence between the reading and the exposition. He sat (*εκαθιϲεν*)—the posture of authority and judgment. The gaze (*ατενιζον*) of the people represents the whole creation looking to the Logos for the interpretation of its mystery.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ηρξατο δε λεγιν προϲ αυτουϲ οτι ϲημερον πε η γραφη αυτη εν τοιϲ ωϲιν ϋμων

**English Translation**
And he began to say to them that: Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The homily is brief but infinite in weight. *Σημερον* (Today)—not in the past history of Israel, nor in a distant eschaton, but in the presence of Christ. The fulfillment occurs *εν τοιϲ ωϲιν* (in the ears); faith enters through hearing the Word made flesh speak the Word written.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και παντεϲ εμαρτυρουν αυτω και εθαυμαζον επι τοιϲ λογοιϲ τηϲ χα τοιϲ εκπορευ εκ του ϲτο αυτου και ε ουχι εϲ ϊωϲηφ ουτοϲ

**English Translation**
And all were bearing witness to him and wondering at the words of grace proceeding out of his mouth, and were saying: Is this not [the son] of Joseph?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A dual movement of the soul: they marvel at the *χαριτος* (grace) yet stumble over the flesh. They witness the divine power in His speech (*ϲτο αυτου*) but immediately attempt to contain Him within earthly lineage (*ϊωϲηφ*). They cannot reconcile the Carpenter with the King.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν προϲ αυ παντωϲ ερει μοι την παραβο ταυτην ϊατρε θεραπευϲον ϲεαυ οϲα ηκουϲαμ ηκουϲαμ γενομενα ειϲ τ τ καφαρναουμ ποι και ωδε εν τη πατριδι ϲου

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Doubtless you will say to me this parable, Physician, heal yourself; as many things as we heard [we heard] happening in Capharnaum, do also here in your fatherland.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He exposes the hidden skepticism of their hearts. They desire the miracles (*γενομενα... καφαρναουμ*) without the mystery. The demand "Heal yourself" (*θεραπευϲον ϲεαυ*) is the taunt of the world to the Church: prove your power by serving our immediate needs, or we will not believe.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αμην λε ϋμιν οτι ουδιϲ προφητηϲ δεκτοϲ εϲτιν εν τη πατρι εαυτου

**English Translation**
And he said: Amen I say to you, that no prophet is acceptable in his own fatherland.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The axiom of rejection. While the year of the Lord is *δεκτοϲ* (acceptable, v.19), the messenger is not *δεκτοϲ* to his kin. Familiarity blinds the eye to the sacred; those closest to the altar are often the most immune to the incense.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
επ αλη δε λεγω ϋμ οτι πολλαι χηραι ηϲαν εν ταιϲ ημε ηλιου εν τω οτε εκλιϲθη ο ου επι ετη τρι και μηναϲ εξ ωϲ εγενετο λιμοϲ μεγαϲ επι παϲαν την γην

**English Translation**
But in truth I say to you that many widows were in the days of Elias in the [land of Israel], when the heaven was shut for three years and six months, so that a great famine came upon all the earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the Lord’s use of history to pierce the veil of local pride. He invokes the "days of Elias" (*hemerais heliou*), a time of judgment when the heavens were shut (*ekleisthe ho ouranos*). The duration, "three years and six months," is specific, reminding us that divine chastisement is measured and precise, not chaotic. The "great famine" (*limos megas*) afflicted the whole earth, yet the Lord highlights a distinction in grace. He prepares the listeners for the hard truth: proximity to the covenant does not guarantee the reception of miracles; only faith and divine election open the storehouses of heaven.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και προϲ ουδεμιαν αυτ επεμφθη ηλει ει μη ειϲ ϲαρε τηϲ ϲιδωνι προϲ γυναικα χηραν

**English Translation**
And to none of them was Elias sent, except to Sarepta of Sidonia, to a widow woman.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here lies the scandal that incites their wrath. The prophet was sent (*epemphthe*) not to the daughters of Israel, but to a foreigner, to Sarepta of Sidonia. This prefigures the calling of the Gentiles. The "widow woman" represents the soul destitute of worldly power and Jewish legalism, empty so that she might be filled by the Word. By bypassing the "many" to save the "one" outsider, Christ demonstrates that the distribution of grace is sovereign and often offends the entitled.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και πολλοι λεπροι ηϲαν εν τω επι ελιϲαι του προφητου και ουδιϲ αυτων εκαθαριϲθη ει μη ναιμαν ο ϲυροϲ

**English Translation**
And many lepers were in the [land] in the time of Elisaios the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naiman the Syrian.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the Lord strikes at the root of their presumption. Leprosy, the visible mark of sin and corruption, was abundant within the fold, yet the cleansing (*ekatharisthe*) was reserved for Naiman the Syrian. The water of Jordan cleansed the Gentile commander, signifying baptism which washes the nations. The exclusion of the "many" Israelites serves as a terrifying warning: one may dwell in the presence of the prophet and remain unclean if the heart is hardened against the command of God.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
και επληϲθηϲαν παντεϲ θυμου εν τη ϲυναγωγη ακου ταυτα

**English Translation**
And all were filled with wrath in the synagogue hearing these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how quickly the "marveling" turns to murder. They are filled (*eplesthesan*) not with the Spirit, but with wrath (*thymou*). The synagogue, a place designed for the reading of Law and peace, becomes a vessel of rage because the Truth has held a mirror to their envy. They cannot refute the history—Elias and Elisaios indeed did these things—so they attack the Expositor. Truth that humbles the proud inevitably generates violence in the unrepentant heart.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και α εξεβα αυτον εξω τηϲ πο και ηγαγ αυτον εωϲ οφρυ του ορουϲ εφ ου η πολιϲ ωκοδο αυτων ωϲτε κατακρημνιϲαι αυτον

**English Translation**
And rising up they cast him out of the city and led him to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, so as to throw him down the cliff.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rejection is total. They cast him out (*exebalon*) just as the scapegoat is sent away, yet here they intend deicide. They lead him to the "brow of the mountain," a type of the hill of Golgotha. Note the proprietary language: "their city" (*polis auton*). They claim the earthly city and its foundations, but in doing so, they attempt to cast down the Foundation Stone of the universe. They wish to hurl him down (*katakremnisai*), proving that the carnal mind seeks to destroy what it cannot control.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ δε δι δια μεϲου αυτων επορευετο

**English Translation**
But he, passing through the midst of them, went his way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A miracle of majesty and restraint. He does not call down fire like Elias; he simply passes through (*dielthon*). The text implies a divine intangibility; the mob surrounds him, yet cannot touch him because his hour had not yet come. He "went his way" (*eporeueto*), indicating that his path is determined by the Father, not by the will of men. He walks through the valley of the shadow of death and fears no evil, for He is the Light.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
και κατηλθεν ειϲ καφαρναουμ πο τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ και ην διδαϲκ αυτουϲ εν τοιϲ ϲαβ

**English Translation**
And he came down to Capharnaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the sabbaths.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He descends (*katelthen*) from the murderous heights of Nazareth to the humble depths of Capharnaum. Rejection in one place leads to illumination in another. He continues "teaching" (*didaskon*), showing that the malice of men cannot silence the Word of God. He honors the Sabbath (*sabbasin*), using the day of rest to offer the rest of instruction to the weary souls of Galilee.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
και εξεπληϲ επι τη διδα αυτου οτι εν ε ην ο λογοϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
And they were astonished at his teaching, because his word was with authority.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The people perceive a difference in quality. The scribes speak by citation and conjecture; Christ speaks with authority (*en exousia*). The word (*logos*) here is not merely sound, but power. It strikes the conscience and binds the intellect. This "authority" is the self-authenticating power of the Creator speaking to the creature. They are astonished (*exeplessonto*)—literally struck out of their senses—by the force of Truth.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και εν τη ϲυ ην ανθρω εχων δαιμονιου ακαθαρ και ανεκραξ φωνη μεγαλη

**English Translation**
And in the synagogue was a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even in the holy place (*en te synagoge*), the enemy lurks. The man is possessed by a "spirit of an unclean demon" (*pneumia daimoniou akathartou*). The presence of Holiness forces the darkness to manifest; the demon cannot remain silent when the Word is present. It cries out (*anekraxen*), a shriek of terror and opposition. Where Christ is preached in power, the hidden evils are compelled to reveal themselves.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
εα τι ημιν και ϲοι ι ναζαρηνε ηλθεϲ απολεϲαι ημαϲ οιδα ϲε τιϲ ει ο αγι του

**English Translation**
Ah! What to us and to thee, Jesus Nazarene? Didst thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demon possesses theological knowledge but lacks charity. It correctly identifies the two natures: "Jesus Nazarene" (the human) and "the Holy One of God" (the divine). It trembles at judgment, asking, "Didst thou come to destroy us?" (*apolesai hemas*). This confession proves that orthodox language without a submissive heart is the faith of demons. It tries to gain power over Him by naming Him, but the Holy One is not bound by the recognition of the unclean.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και επε αυτω ο λεγων φιμω και εξελθε απ αυτου και ριψ ριψ αυτον το δαιμο ειϲ το μεϲ μεϲ εξηλθεν απ αυ μηδεν βλα αυτον

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] rebuked him, saying: Be muzzled, and come out from him. And the demon, having thrown him into the midst, came out from him, having harmed him nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord refuses the testimony of the devil. "Be muzzled" (*phimotheti*)—literally, be gagged. He silences the noise to liberate the man. The exorcism is dramatic: the demon throws the man "into the midst" (*eis to meson*), a final act of spite, yet the power of God restrains it, so it "harmed him nothing" (*meden blapsan*). Christ separates the sinner from the sin, casting out the oppressor while preserving the victim intact.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
και ε θαμβοϲ επι πανταϲ και ϲυνελαλουν προϲ αλληλουϲ λεγον τιϲ ο λογοϲ ου οτι εν εξουϲι και δυναμι επι τοιϲ ακαθαρ π και ϋ αυτω και ε κ(αι) εξερχοντ(αι)

**English Translation**
And amazement came upon all, and they spoke together with one another, saying: What is this word? For with authority and power [he commands] the unclean spirits, and they obey him and come out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The result of the miracle is "amazement" (*thambos*)—a holy dread. They question the nature of the "word" (*logos*). It is not magic, but "authority and power" (*exousia kai dynamei*). The text here is compressed, showing the urgency of the spirits' obedience (*hupakouousin*—implied in the abbreviated text). The unclean spirits (*akathartois pneumasin*) have no choice; when the Word commands, the usurpers must flee. The Kingdom of God is demonstrated not in word only, but in the subjugation of the spiritual powers of wickedness.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) εξεπορευετο κ̣α̣ι̣ ε̣ κ(αι) εξεπορευετο ηχοϲ περι αυτου ειϲ π π τοπον τηϲ πε

**English Translation**
And there went out... and... and there went out a sound concerning him into e[very] place of the su[rrounding region].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, how the scribe’s hand trembles and stammers, writing *kai exeporeueto* ("and there went out") twice, with hesitation in between. Is this not fitting? For the *echos*—the sound, the report, the reverberation of the Christ—is so potent it demands repetition. The fame of the Lord does not merely travel; it echoes. It penetrates *eis panta topon* (into every place). The text is truncated at *tēs pe[richōrou]*, yet we understand: the boundaries of the region cannot contain the report of the Word made flesh.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
αναϲταϲ δε απο τηϲ ϲυνα ειϲηλθ ειϲηλθ ειϲ την οικιαν του ϲιμωνοϲ π π δε του ϲιμω ην ϲυνεχο πυρετω μεγαλω και ηρω αυτον πε αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And having risen from the syna[gogue], he entered, he entered into the house of Simon; now [the mother-in-law] of Simon was being held by a great fever, and they asked him concerning her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the scribe repeats *eisēlthen* ("he entered"), emphasizing the transition from the public sphere of the synagogue to the intimate sphere of the *oikian* (house). See the condition of the woman: she is *synechomenē*—held fast, gripped, constrained—by a "great fever." The fever is not merely a heat; it is a captor. The Church, prefigured here by the household of Simon, responds with intercession: *ērōtēsan* (they asked) Him. We do not demand healing; we beseech the Presence.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και επι επανω αυτηϲ επετιμηϲεν τω πυρετω και αφη αυτην ο πυρε παραχρημα δε αναϲταϲα διηκο αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And [standing] over her, he rebuked the fever, and the fever left her; and immediately having risen, she ministered to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the stance of authority: *epistās epanō* (standing over). He does not administer a potion; He issues a command. He *epetimēsen* (rebuked) the fever, treating the malady as a hostile entity, just as He rebuked the demon. The result is *parachrēma* (immediate). There is no long convalescence when the Creator restores the creature. And what is the fruit of this restoration? *Diēkonei*—she served. We are healed not for idleness, but for liturgy and service.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
δυνον δε του ηλιου παντεϲ οϲοι ειχ ειχ αϲθενουνταϲ νο ποικιλαιϲ η αυτουϲ προϲ αυτον ο δε ενι ενϊ ενι ε αυτων ε ταϲ χιραϲ εθεραπευϲεν αυ

**English Translation**
Now as the sun was setting, all as many as had [had] those being weak with divers dis[eases] led them to him; but he, on each one of them [laying] the hands, healed th[em].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sun sets, ending the Sabbath rest, and the flood of human misery arrives. The text stutters on *eich* (had), perhaps reflecting the overwhelming number. Yet, look at the Lord's method. He does not heal the crowd *en masse* with a distant wave. The text specifies *heni hekasto*—to each one individually. He lays *tas chiras* (the hands) upon them. The Incarnation is tactile; the Bishop lays hands because the High Priest first laid His hands upon the sick.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
εξηρχοντο δε και δαιμονια πολλων κραζον κραζοντα και λεγοντα οτι ϲυ ει ο του και επιτιμων ου εια αυτα λαλιν ο ηδιϲαν τον αυτον ειναι

**English Translation**
And demons also came out from many, crying [crying] out and saying that: You are the [Son] of [God]. And rebuking, he did not allow them to speak, be[cause] they knew him to be the [Christ].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes *krazon krazonta* (crying crying), doubling the participial form, capturing the cacophony of the abyss. The demons confess what men doubt: *Sy ei* (You are!). The text abbreviates the title, reading *ho tou* (the [Son] of [God]), as if the holy name is too heavy for the demonic tongue or the scribe's pen in this context. Christ enforces silence; He will not accept the testimony of darkness. Truth spoken by a lie remains a deception in intent.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
γενομενηϲ δε η εξελθων επορευθη ειϲ ερη τοπον και οι οχλοι επεζητουν αυτ και ηλθον εωϲ αυ και κατειχον αυτον του μη πο απ αυτ

**English Translation**
And when it became d[ay], having gone out, he went into a des[ert] place; and the crowds sought h[im], and came unto h[im], and detained him so as not to go from th[em].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord seeks the *erēmon* (desert/lonely place) for communion with the Father, but the world intrudes. The crowds *kateichon* (were holding/detaining) Him. Compare this to verse 38 where the fever "held" the woman. Here, the crowd tries to become the fever, binding Christ to their own location and will. They desire the Healer, but they do not yet understand the Mission. They wish to possess Him; He wishes to redeem them.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν προϲ αυ οτι και ταιϲ ε πολεϲιν ευ με δει το ευαγγελιον την βαϲιλει του οτι επι του απεϲταλην

**English Translation**
But he said to th[em] that: Also to the o[ther] cities I must [preach] the gospel [of] the kingdom of [God], because for th[is] I was sent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the divine necessity: *dei* (it is necessary/I must). The Gospel is kinetic, not static. It belongs to *tais heterais polesin* (the other cities), not just Capernaum. The content of the preaching is explicitly *tēn basileian* (the Kingdom). The scribe abbreviates the divine names, rushing, as Christ rushes, toward the fulfillment of the mission. He was *apestalēn* (sent/apostled) for this very thing—to sow the Kingdom across the breadth of the earth.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
και ην κηρυϲϲων ειϲ ταϲ ϲυναγωγαϲ τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ

**English Translation**
And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judaea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Attend carefully to the parchment! While other traditions may read "Galilee," our Codex Sinaiticus boldly inscribes *tēs Ioudaias* (of Judaea). Even though He is in the north, the text logically extends His Lordship over the whole land of the Promise. He preaches in the synagogues of the very region that will eventually reject Him. From the outset, the shadow of Jerusalem and the Cross falls upon His ministry. He claims the whole inheritance of David, from Galilee to Judaea.
