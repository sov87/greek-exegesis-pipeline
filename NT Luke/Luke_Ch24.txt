**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
τη δε μια των ϲαβ ορθου βα επι το μνη ηλθον φερου α ητοιμαϲαν αρωματα ˙

**English Translation**
But on the one [day] of the sabbaths, at deep dawn, they came to the tomb bearing the spices which they had prepared.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the precision of the sacred scribe. The text reads *orthou ba*, an abbreviation for *orthrou batheos* (deep dawn). The light of the Resurrection begins not in the blaze of noon but in the depths of the morning darkness. The women bring *aromata* (spices), intending to honor a corpse, yet their very act of service prepares them to witness the abolition of death. They come "on the one" (*te de mia*)—the first day, the new creation initiating.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ευρον δε τον λιθον απο απο του μνημι

**English Translation**
But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The obstacle is removed. The Greek text here exhibits a stutter in the transcription, repeating *apo* (away from), emphasizing the total removal of the barrier. The stone, intended to seal the corruption of the grave, has been displaced by divine power. The tomb (*mnemi*) is open; the earth cannot contain the Creator.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ειϲελθουϲαι δε ουκ ευρον το ϲωμα του

**English Translation**
And having entered, they did not find the body of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the brevity here. The text states they did not find "the body of him" (*to soma tou*). The silence of the tomb speaks louder than the presence of the dead. The flesh that was sown in weakness is not found, for it is being raised in power. The absence of the body is the first herald of the miracle.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω αποριϲθαι αυταϲ περι τουτου και ϊ ανδρεϲ δυο ε αυταιϲ εν εϲθητι αϲτρα

**English Translation**
And it came to pass, while they were perplexed about this, and [behold] two men [stood by] them in clothing flashing like lightning.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Human reason halts at the boundary of the resurrection; the women are in *aporia* (perplexity). Into this confusion, heaven intervenes. The text abbreviates the sudden appearance (*i* for *idou*, *e* for *epestesan*), rushing to describe the glory: *estheti astra*, clothing that flashes like lightning. The divine messengers bring illumination to the darkness of human grief.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
εμφοβων δε γε αυτ και κλινουϲων τα προϲωπα ειϲ τ γην ειπαν προϲ αυ ˙ τι ζητειτε τ ζωντα μετα των νεκρων

**English Translation**
But they having become terrified and bowing their faces to the earth, they said to them: Why do you seek the living among the dead?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear (*emphobon*) is the natural reaction of mortality to immortality. They bow their faces to the earth (*gen*), the place of dust and death, but the question from heaven redirects them. "Why do you seek the living among the dead?" This is the great interrogation of the faith. He is the Living One (*t zonta*); He has no portion with the corruption of the grave.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ουκ ε ωδε αλλα η μνηϲθη ωϲ ελαληϲεν ϋμιν ετι ων εν τη γαλιλαια

**English Translation**
He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke to you while he was still in Galilee,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A definitive negation: *ouk e wde* (He is not here). This absence is the proof of the *egerthe* (He is risen). The angel commands memory (*mnesthe*). Faith is not a new invention but the realization of the Word previously spoken. The mystery was declared in Galilee, in the midst of daily life, before the tragedy of the cross.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
λεγων τον του α οτι δει οτι δει τον του α παραδοθη ειϲ χιραϲ αν αμαρ και ϲταυ και τη τριτη ημερα ανα

**English Translation**
Saying [of] the [Son] of [Man], that it is necessary, that it is necessary for the [Son] of [Man] to be delivered into hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and on the third day to rise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex here emphatically repeats *oti dei* (that it is necessary), underscoring the divine imperative of the Passion. The abbreviations *ton tou a* signify the *Son of Man*, linking the suffering servant to the apocalyptic judge. The path is threefold: delivery (*paradothe*), crucifixion (*stau*), and resurrection (*ana*). It was not an accident of history, but the design of salvation.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και εμνη των ρη αυτου

**English Translation**
And they remembered his words.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to remember bears fruit. *Emnesthesan* (they remembered). The seed of the Word, buried in their hearts, now springs to life alongside the Risen Lord. Understanding follows the alignment of memory with the present reality of God's work.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
και ϋποϲτρεψαϲαι απο του μνημιου απηγγιλαν παντα ταυτα τοιϲ ενδεκα και παϲιν τοιϲ λοι

**English Translation**
And having returned from the tomb, they announced all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The women become the apostles to the apostles. They turn (*hypostrepsasai*) from the place of death (*mnemiou*) to the community of the living. They hold nothing back, announcing "all these things." The circle of the "eleven" indicates the fracture caused by Judas, yet the "rest" (*loipois*) are included in the good news.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε η μαγδα μαριαμ και ϊωαννα και μαρι η ϊακωβου και αι λοιπαι ϲυν αυ αι ελεγον προϲ τουϲ αποϲτολουϲ ταυτα

**English Translation**
Now it was the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary the [mother] of James, and the rest with them, [who] were saying these things to the apostles.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The witnesses are named, validating the testimony. Mary the Magdalene leads the chorus of heralds. Note the persistence in the imperfect verb *elegon* (they were saying)—it was not a single remark but a continuous, insistent proclamation to the apostles (*tous apostolous*), who were slow to hear.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και εφανη ενωπιον αυ ωϲει ληροϲ τα ρηματα ταυτα και ηπιϲτουν αυταιϲ

**English Translation**
And these words appeared before them as if nonsense, and they disbelieved them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the frailty of men. The truth of the Resurrection strikes the natural mind as *leros*—idle talk, nonsense, delirium. The text says the words "appeared" (*ephane*) this way to them. Disbelief (*epistoun*) is the initial barrier that the reality of the Resurrection must shatter. The apostles trust their despair more than the women's hope.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πετροϲ ανα εδραμεν ε το μνημιον και παρακυψαϲ βλε τα οθονια μονα και απηλθεν προϲ ε θαυμαζ το γεγονοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
But Peter, having risen, ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he sees the linen cloths alone; and he departed to [himself], wondering at what had happened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter breaks the paralysis of disbelief with action. He runs (*edramen*). Upon stooping (*parakypsas*), he sees only the *othonia* (linen cloths)—the grave clothes left behind, signifying the body was not stolen but transfigured. He departs *pros e* (to himself), in a state of *thaumazon* (wonder). He has moved from mockery to marveling, standing on the threshold of faith.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και ‾̷‾ ϊ δυο εξ αυτων η εν τη αυτη ημερα ‾̷‾ ηϲαν δε πορευο ειϲ κωμ απεχουϲαν ϲτα εκατον ε απο ϊε η ονο εμμαουϲ

**English Translation**
And behold, two of them were in the same day going to a village being distant stades one hundred and sixty from Jerusalem, the name of which [is] Emmaus.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Attend closely to the reading of this Codex, for it differs from the common lection. Where many read sixty stades, this ancient witness testifies to *hekaton hexēkonta*—one hundred and sixty. Whether this marks a different Emmaus or signifies a deeper spiritual distance, we perceive the weary length of their retreat. They journey away from the City of Peace (*Jerusalem*), lengthening the distance between themselves and the site of the Passion, walking deep into the wilderness of their own doubt.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοι ωμιλουν προϲ αλληλουϲ περι παντων τ ϲυμβεβηκοτ τουτων

**English Translation**
And they were conversing with one another concerning all these things having happened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the communion of sorrow. Before they break the bread of thanksgiving, they break the bitter bread of memory. They converse (*homiloun*), turning the tragedy over in their minds, seeking logic in the *symbebēkotōn* (the things that have befallen). The human mind, unaided by the Spirit, circles the Cross but cannot penetrate its mystery; it sees the event but not the victory.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και εγε εν τω ομι αυτουϲ και ϲυνζητειν και αυ εγγιϲαϲ ϲυ αυ ιν

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in their conversing and seeking together, even Jesus himself having drawn near was journeying with them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the divine economy: He is found by those who flee Him, provided they seek the truth. While they question (*synzētein*—seeking together), the Answer approaches. The text emphasizes *autos Iēsous*—He Himself. He does not send an angel or a prophet; the Shepherd Himself pursues the wandering sheep. He joins their way, sanctifying the journey of the confused.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
οι δε οφθαλ αυτων εκρα του μη ε αυτον

**English Translation**
But their eyes were held so as not to know him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Ekratounto*—they were held fast. This passive restraint suggests a divine purpose. It is not merely that they were distracted, but that their vision was suspended by a higher power. Revelation is not a conquest of the human eye, but a gift of the Divine Will. They see the traveler, but the Lord is veiled, that He might first open the Scriptures before He opens their eyes.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυ τινεϲ οι λογοι ουτοι ουϲ αντιβαλ προϲ αλληλουϲ αλληλουϲ περιπατο και εϲταθηϲ εϲταθηϲ ϲκυθρωποι

**English Translation**
And he said to them: What [are] these words which you exchange with one another walking? And they stood still, sad-faced.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex repeats *estathēsan* (they stood), emphasizing the abrupt halt. The question of the Lord arrests their motion. Sorrow has a paralyzing weight; when confronted by the demand to articulate their grief, they can no longer walk. They stand *skythrōpoi*—sullen, gloomy, with countenances cast down. The Light of the World stands before them, yet they remain in the shadow of the tomb.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
απο δε ειϲ ονοματι κλεο ειπεν προϲ αυτον ϲυ μονοϲ παροικειϲ ϊ και ταυτα ουκ ε τα γενομε εν αυτη εν ταιϲ ημεραιϲ ταυταιϲ

**English Translation**
And answering one, by name Cleopas, said to him: Do you alone sojourn in Jerusalem and have not known the things having happened in it in these days?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
O profound irony! Cleopas asks the Author of History if He is ignorant of the events of the day. He calls the Lord a *paroikos*—a stranger or sojourner. Indeed, Christ is the stranger in this fallen world, though He made it. The disciple rebukes the Master for ignorance, while he himself is ignorant of the very One standing before him.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ ποια οι δε ειπαν αυτω τα περι του ναζαρηνου οϲ εγενετο ανηρ προφητηϲ δυνα εν λογω και εργω εναντιον του και παντοϲ του λαου

**English Translation**
And he said to them: What sort of things? And they said to him: The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who became a man, a prophet powerful in word and work before God and all the people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the imperfection of their faith. They confess Him as *Iēsou tou Nazarenou*, and as a *prophētēs* (prophet), and a man (*anēr*) powerful in deed. This is true, yet insufficient. They see the Elijah-like power, the miracle worker, but they have lost the confession of the Sonship. They speak of what He "became," looking to the past, unaware of the eternal present standing in their midst.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
οπωϲ τε παρεδωκαν αυ οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι αρχοντεϲ ημων ειϲ κριμα θανατου και εϲταυ αυτον

**English Translation**
And how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to a judgment of death and crucified him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They identify the agents of the catastrophe: the *archontes* (rulers) and priests. The scandal of the Cross is the "judgment of death." To the carnal mind, the Cross is the end of the story, a defeat by the powers of this world. They recount the crucifixion as a tragedy to be mourned, not a sacrifice to be adored.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
η δε ελπιζο οτι αυτοϲ ε ο μελλων λυτρουϲθαι τον ι αλλα γε και ϲυν παϲι τουτοιϲ τρι ταυτην ημε αγι αφ ου ταυτα ε

**English Translation**
But we were hoping that he is the one about to redeem Israel; but indeed also with all these things, he passes this third day since these things happened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"We were hoping" (*ēlpizomen*)—the imperfect tense of lost expectation. They looked for a political redemption of Israel (*lytrousthai*). And note the mention of the "third day." They possess the timeline of the prophecy, yet they lack the understanding. They complain that it is the third day, the very day appointed for life, citing it as proof of the finality of death.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
αλλα και γυναικεϲ τινεϲ εξ ημων εξεϲτη ημαϲ γενο ορθριναι επι το μνημιον

**English Translation**
But also some women from among us astonished us, having been early at the tomb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The witness of the women is described as *exestēsan*—they drove us out of our wits, they astonished us. The apostolic band is in disarray; the faithful women are the first heralds of the new creation, arriving *orthrinai* (at early dawn). Yet, to these men, this testimony brings confusion rather than clarity.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και μη ευρουϲαι το ϲωμα αυτου ηλ λεγουϲαι και οπταϲιαν αγγελ εωρακεναι οι λε αυτον ζην

**English Translation**
And not finding his body they came saying also to have seen a vision of angels, who say he lives.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They report the absence of the *sōma* (body) and the vision of angels. The message is explicit: *legousin auton zēn* (they say he lives). Yet, Cleopas and his companion are walking away. They have the facts—the empty tomb, the angelic word—but without the internal illumination of the Spirit, the Resurrection remains a rumor, a "vision," rather than a reality.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και απηλθον τινεϲ των ϲυν ημιν ε το μνημιον κ(αι) ευρον ουτωϲ κα και αι γυναι ειπον αυτ δε ουκ ειδον

**English Translation**
And some of those with us went to the tomb and found it thus, just as also the women said, but him they did not see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Verification of the void. The men went, they saw the emptiness "just as the women said," but "Him they did not see." The physical eye can see the empty tomb, but it cannot see the Risen Lord. Faith is not born from the absence of a corpse, but from the presence of the Christ. They sought the living among the dead and found nothing; now the Living One seeks them.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ ω ανοη και βραδειϲ τη καρδια του πιϲτευ επι παϲιν οιϲ ελαληϲαν οι προ

**English Translation**
And he said to them, "O foolish ones and slow in heart to believe upon all things which the pro[phets] spoke."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the Lord’s rebuke, not of the intellect alone, but of the *kardia* (heart). He calls them *anoe* (without mind/understanding) because true understanding requires the heart's quickness, not merely the mind's sharpness. The text truncates "the prophets" (*oi pro*), as if the very mention of them was cut short in the disciples' memory, requiring the Word himself to complete the thought. We see here that sluggishness in faith is a malady of the inner man, preventing the grasp of the prophetic fullness which speaks entirely of Him.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ουχι ταυτα εδει παθειν τον και ειϲελθειν ειϲ την δοξαν αυτου

**English Translation**
Was it not necessary for the [One] to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here presents a stark mystery: the article *ton* (the) stands without its noun, the sacred name of Christ being absent from the ink yet present in the necessity (*edei*) of the suffering. It is as if the suffering itself defines the Title; He is "The [Suffering One]." The path to *doxan* (glory) is not parallel to suffering but through it. The grammar of the cross dictates that the entrance (*eiselthein*) into glory is syntactically dependent upon the passion.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και αρξα απο μω και απο π π των προφη και διερμη διερμηνευϲεν αυτοιϲ τι ην εν ταιϲ γραφαιϲ τα περι εαυτου

**English Translation**
And beginning from Mo[ses] and from a[ll] a[ll] the prophets, and inter- interpreted to them what was in the scriptures the things concerning himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the stammering of the scribe in *p p* (all all) and *dierme diermeneusen* (inter- interpreted), which mirrors the overflowing abundance of the Lord's exegesis. He begins from *Mo* (Moses), the fountainhead of the Law, and moves through the prophets. The repetition of "interpreted" suggests a thorough, layer-by-layer unfolding of the mysteries. He finds *ta peri heautou* (the things concerning himself) not as scattered gems, but as the very substance of the Scriptures. The text stumbles in awe, for who can easily transcribe the moment the Word explains the Word?

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ηγγιϲαν ειϲ την κωμην ου επορευ και αυτοϲ προϲεποιηϲατο πορρωτερωτερω πορρωτερω πορευεϲθαι

**English Translation**
And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he made as if to go far-far-farther far-farther.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text exhibits a profound stutter in *porroterotero porrotero* (far-far-farther far-farther). This scribal repetition captures the infinite distance of the Divine Nature which, though near to us in flesh, remains ever beyond us in essence. He "made as if" (*prosepoiesato*) to go further, not to deceive, but to elicit the hunger of their hospitality. He desires to be held back by our prayers; He feigns departure so that we might constrain Him to stay. The excessive length of the word on the page mimics the length of the journey He appeared ready to undertake.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και παρεβιαϲαντο αυ λεγοντεϲ μι μεθ ημ οτι προϲ εϲπερ εϲπερ εϲτιν και κεκλι ηδη η ημε και ειϲηλθεν του μιναι ϲυν αυ

**English Translation**
And they constrained hi[m] saying, "Stay with u[s], because it is toward even- even-ing, and the d[ay] has already declined." And he entered to stay with the[m].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the disciples is audible in the duplication *esper esper* (even- evening). As the light of the physical day (*he hemera*) declines, the need for the Light of the World increases. They force Him (*parebiasanto*), a violence of love that God permits. The abbreviations *mi* (stay) and *hm* (us) show the haste of their plea. He enters not merely a house, but their fellowship, yielding to their desire for communion against the encroaching night.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω κατακλιθη αυτον μετ αυ και λαβων τον αρτον η και κλαϲαϲ εδιδου αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in his reclining with the[m], and taking the bread he bl[essed] and breaking it he gave to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Eucharistic pattern: taking, blessing, breaking, giving. The text reads *e* (or *h*), likely a contraction for *eulogesen* (blessed). Even in the cryptic shorthand of the codex, the act is unmistakable. He assumes the role of the host in a house not His own, showing that wherever the Bread is broken, He is the Master of the table. The breaking (*klasas*) is the revelation; the fragmentation of the bread mirrors the opening of their eyes which follows.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
αυ δε διηνυγη διηνυχθηϲαν οι οφθαλμοι κ(αι) επεγνωϲαν αυτ κ(αι) επεγνωϲαν αυτ και αυτοϲ αφαν εγενετο απ αυ

**English Translation**
But their eyes were op- opened, and they recognized hi[m] and they recognized hi[m], and he became invisible from the[m].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles to write "opened" (*dienuge dienuchthesan*), reflecting the difficulty of spiritual sight breaking through the veil of flesh. Then, the recognition is stated twice: *epegnosan aut epegnosan aut*. This doubling confirms the certainty of the revelation; they knew Him in the body, and they knew Him in the Spirit. Yet, precisely at the moment of full recognition, He becomes *aphan* (invisible). We possess Him by faith in the Mystery, not by sight in the world. He vanishes to be present everywhere.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
και ειπαν προϲ αλ ουχι η καρ ημων κεομε ην εν ημιν ωϲ ελαλει ημιν εν τη οδω ωϲ δι ημιν ταϲ γραφαϲ

**English Translation**
And they said to [one] an[other], "Was not our hear[t] burn[ing] within us as he spoke to us on the way, as he op[ened] to us the scriptures?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heart (*kar*) burning (*keome*) is the internal witness of the Truth before the intellect grasps it. The text links the burning heart directly to the opening (*di*) of the Scriptures. The Word creates heat in the soul. Note that the "opening" of the Scriptures corresponds to the "opening" of their eyes in the previous verse. The text is fragmented (*al, kar, keome*), yet the fire of the Spirit binds the meaning together. The liturgy of the road—reading the Word—prepares for the liturgy of the table.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και α αυτη τη ωρα ϋπεϲτρε ειϲ ϊερουϲα και ευρον η τουϲ ενδεκα και τουϲ ϲυν αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And r[ising] in that hour they return[ed] to Jerusa[lem], and found g[athered] the eleven and those with them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Resurrection compels motion. *A* stands for *anastantes* (rising); they cannot remain in the village once the Bread is broken. They return to *Ierousa* (Jerusalem), the center of the drama. They find the eleven *e* (gathered, *ethroismenous*). The unity of the Church is reassembling. The scattered sheep are finding the fold again, drawn by the gravity of the Risen Shepherd.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
λεγ οτι οντωϲ η ο και ω τω ϲιμωνι

**English Translation**
Say[ing] that indeed the L[ord] was r[aised] and ap[peared] to Simon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A verse of holy brevity and heavy abbreviation. *H* (*egerthe* - raised), *O* (*kurios* - Lord), *O* (*ophthe* - appeared). The scribe reduces the greatest news of history to single letters, perhaps indicating that among the faithful, the code is known. "The Lord is raised indeed!" The appearance to Simon Peter is singular, a restoration of the one who denied, confirmed here before the travelers can even speak their own tale. The Resurrection is a reality verified by witnesses, condensed here into the diamond-hard truth of the *Nomina Sacra*.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και αυτοι εξηγο εξηγο τα εν τη οδω και ωϲ εγνωϲθη αυτοιϲ εν τη κλα του αρτου ˙

**English Translation**
And they relat- related the things on the way and how he was known to them in the break[ing] of the bread.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again the stutter, *exego exego* (related related), showing the eagerness of their testimony. They recount the road and the table. The climax of their gnosis was *en te kla* (in the breaking) of the bread. This is the seal of the chapter: Christ is known not merely in the walking or the talking, but in the sacramental act. The punctuation at the end marks a pause, a breath before the Lord Himself manifests to the gathered whole.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα δε αυτων λαλουντων αυ εϲτη εν μεϲω αυτων και λεγει αυτοιϲ ειρηνη ϋμιν

**English Translation**
And as they were speaking these things, h[e] stood in their midst and says to them, "Peace to you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the church speaks of Him, He appears. *Au este* (He stood) in the middle (*meso*). He is the center of the congregation. His first word to the gathered fear and joy is *Eirene* (Peace). This is not a wish but a bestowal. The Peace of the Risen One is the foundation of the new creation. He stands solid and real, ending the rumors with Presence.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
φοβηθεν δε και εμφο γενομενοι εδοκουν π θε

**English Translation**
But being frightened and becoming terrified, they thought [they] beheld a spirit.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the fragility of the human heart when confronted with the Divine. The text reads *phobethen* (frightened), capturing the visceral recoil of the disciples. The scribe, perhaps in haste or awe, abbreviates the object of their terror: *p* for *pneuma* (spirit) and *the* for *theorein* (to behold). They mistake the Victor over death for a mere shade, unable yet to comprehend that the Resurrection has redeemed the flesh, not discarded it.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και ειπ αυτοιϲ τι τεταραγ εϲτε και δια τι διαλογιϲμοι αναβαινουϲιν εν ταιϲ καρδιαιϲ ϋμων

**English Translation**
And he said to them, 'Why are ye troubled, and why do reasonings arise in your hearts?'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Physician of Souls diagnoses the internal malady. *Tetarag* (troubled) indicates a turbulent confusion, like water stirred by a storm. The Lord questions the *dialogismoi* (reasonings/disputes) that ascend from the heart. In our anthropology, the heart is the seat of the intellect; here it is clouded by the logic of the fallen world, which denies life after death. He challenges them to silence these ascending doubts with the presence of the Word.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
ειδετε τουϲ ποδαϲ μου και ταϲ χιραϲ μου οτι εγω ειμι αυτοϲ ψηλαφηϲατε με και ϊδετε οτι π π ϲαρκαϲ ϲαρκα ϲαρκα και οϲτεα ουκ εχει καθωϲ εμε θεωρειται ε

**English Translation**
See my feet and my hands, that I am he; handle me and see; for a spirit [spirit] has not flesh [flesh flesh] and bones, as ye behold me [having].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fortress against the Docetists! The Lord commands tactile proof: *pselaphesate* (handle me). The manuscript stammers in its witness—repeating *p* (spirit) and *sarka* (flesh) thrice—as if trembling before the mystery. We see here the affirmation of material reality in the Kingdom. The Risen One is not a phantom; He possesses *ostea* (bones) and *sarka* (flesh). The scribe's struggle with the text mirrors the mind's struggle to grasp the Incarnate God returning from the grave.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και τουτο ει εδιξεν αυτοιϲ ταϲ χιραϲ και τουϲ ποδαϲ

**English Translation**
And [saying] this, he showed them the hands and the feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He displays the trophies of His Passion. *Edixen* (he showed) implies a deliberate revelation. The hands and feet, likely bearing the marks of the nails, are the seals of His identity. The continuity between the Crucified and the Risen is absolute; the body that suffered is the body that is glorified. We must venerate these wounds, for through them, the world is healed.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ετι δε απιϲτουντ απιϲτουντ αυτων απο τηϲ χα και θαυμαζ θαυμαζ ειπεν αυτοιϲ εχετε τι βρωϲιμ ωδε ενθαδε

**English Translation**
And while they were yet disbelieving [disbelieving] from the joy and wondering [wondering], he said to them, 'Have ye anything eatable here [here]?'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound paradox: *apistounton apo tes cha* (disbelieving from the joy). The reality of the Resurrection is so overwhelming that it feels like a deception of delight. The text repeats *apistount* and *thaumaz* (wondering), emphasizing the disciples' oscillation between ecstasy and doubt. The Lord grounds them with the most mundane of questions regarding *brosim* (food), and the scribe emphasizes the location with a double *hode enthade* (here here), anchoring the miracle in time and space.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
οι δε επεδω αυτω ϊχθυοϲ οπτου μεροϲ

**English Translation**
And they gave to him a piece of a broiled fish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The offering is simple: *ichthyos optou* (broiled fish). In the catacombs, the Fish (*IXTHYS*) is the secret sign of our Lord. Here, the sign is consumed by the Signified. The disciples minister to the Creator with the fruits of His creation, a reversal of the feeding of the multitude, yet a continuation of the same divine communion.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
και λαβων ενωπιον αυτων εφαγεν

**English Translation**
And having taken [it], he ate before them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He eats *enopion auton* (before them). This is not for the sustenance of the divine body, which knows no hunger, but for the sustenance of their faith. By consuming the fish, He consumes the argument that He is a ghost. It is a pedagogical act of mastication, proving the reality of the Resurrection through the ordinary function of the body.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε προϲ αυ ουτοι οι λογοι ουϲ ελαληϲα προϲ ϋ ετι ων ϲυν υ οτι δει πλη παντα τα γεγραμμενα τω νομω μωϲε εν τοιϲ προφη και ψαλμοι ψαλμοιϲ ψαλμοιϲ πε εμου

**English Translation**
And he said to them, 'These [are] the words which I spoke to you while yet being with you, that it is necessary [for] all things written in the law of Moses [and] in the prophets and psalms [psalms psalms] concerning me [to be fulfilled].'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord unveils the tripartite canon: Law, Prophets, and Psalms. The scribal repetition of *psalmoi* underscores the liturgical depth of the Psalter as a witness to Christ. The word *dei* (it is necessary) reveals the divine inevitability of the economy of salvation. Nothing was accidental; all was written (*gegrammena*) and must be fulfilled (*ple* - *plerothenai*). He is the key that unlocks the ancient scrolls.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
τοτε διηνυξεν αυ τον νουν του ϲυνιεναι ϲυνεϊεναι ϲυνϊεναι ταϲ γρα

**English Translation**
Then he opened their mind to understand [understand understand] the Scriptures.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Understanding is a charismatic act. *Dienyxen* (he opened) suggests the human *nous* (mind) is naturally sealed against the mysteries of God. The scribe writes *synienai* (to understand) three times in varying spellings, reflecting the immense difficulty and the desperate need for this divine illumination. Without the Lord opening the *nous*, the *gra* (Scriptures) remain a closed book.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυ οτι ουτωϲ γε παθειν τον και αναϲτη εκ νεκρων τη τριτη ημερα

**English Translation**
And he said to them that thus it is [written] to suffer [the Christ] and to rise from the dead on the third day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Creed in miniature. The text is stark and abbreviated: *ge* stands for *gegraptai* (it is written), and *ton* awaits the noun *Christon*. The focus is on the verbs: *pathein* (to suffer) and *anaste* (to rise). The "third day" is the temporal anchor of our hope. The suffering was not a defeat, but a scriptural necessity leading to the victory of the Resurrection.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) κηρυχθηναι επι τω ονοματι αυτου μετανοιαν ειϲ α αμαρτιων ειϲ παντα τα εθνη αρξαμενοι απο ϊ

**English Translation**
And [for] repentance for [forgiveness] of sins to be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from J[erusalem].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mandate of the Church is universal. *Metanoian* (repentance) is the path; *a* (abbreviated *aphesin* - forgiveness) is the destination. This proclamation must go to *panta ta ethne* (all the nations), shattering the ethnic boundaries of the old covenant. Yet, it is rooted in history, beginning from *I* (*Ierosolymon* - Jerusalem). The scribe's abbreviations here—*a* for forgiveness, *I* for the Holy City—reflect the common language of the faithful who know these realities by heart.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ εϲτε μαρτυρεϲ του

**English Translation**
Ye are witnesses of [these things].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The definition of the Apostolic office. *Martyres* (witnesses/martyrs) implies not just seeing, but testifying even unto death. The sentence ends abruptly with *tou* (of [these things]), leaving the object open-ended. They are witnesses of the suffering, the rising, the eating, the teaching—the totality of the Christ event. Upon this witness, the Church is built.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
καγω αποϲτελ εξαποϲτελλω την επαγγελι του πατροϲ μου εφ υμαϲ ϋμειϲ δε καθιϲατε εν τη πολει εωϲ ου εν εξ υψουϲ δυναμιν

**English Translation**
And I send—[nay] I send forth—the promise of my Father upon you; but you, sit in the city until [you are] in from height power.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s correction in the divine utterance: he writes *apostel* and immediately overwrites it with *exapostellō*. The Lord does not merely send a message; He sends *forth* the Spirit from the very substance of the Father. The command to "sit" (*kathisate*) in the city is not one of idleness, but of enthronement in patience amidst the world's chaos. The text here is rugged, reading *heōs ou en ex hypsous* ("until in from height"). Whether the verb "to be clothed" is missing or compressed into the preposition *en*, the theology is stark: the Power is not generated from below, but comes strictly *ex hypsous* (out of the height). We must wait until we are "in" that Power.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
εξηγαγεν δε αυτουϲ εωϲ προϲ βηθα και επαραϲ ταϲ χιραϲ αυτου η ηϋλογηϲεν ηϋλογηϲεν αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And he led them out as far as toward Betha[ny]; and having lifted up his hands, he blessed, he blessed them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He leads them to *Betha*—a truncation of Bethany, the house of obedience and suffering. Mark well the duplication in the codex: *ēulogēsen ēulogēsen* ("he blessed, he blessed"). While the worldly eye sees a scribal stutter, the spiritual eye discerns a double portion of grace. As the High Priest lifts His hands—hands that bear the marks of the Passion—the blessing is emphatic, repeated, sealing the Old Covenant and inaugurating the New. He does not cease to bless; the repetition suggests an action that echoes into eternity.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω ευλογιν αυτ αυτουϲ διεϲτη απ αυτων κ(αι) ανεφερετο ειϲ τον ο

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in the blessing th[em]—them, he stood apart from them and was carried up into the h[eaven].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The separation (*diestē*) occurs precisely *within* the act of blessing (*en tō eulogin*). He does not finish the blessing to depart; the departure is the very consummation of the benediction. The text abruptly halts at *eis ton o*—"into the h...". The word for "heaven" (*ouranon*) is cut short, as if the scribe's vision failed as the Lord ascended beyond the veil. He was "carried up" (*anephereto*), a passive verb indicating the Father’s reception of the Son, returning the Incarnate Word to the glory which was His before the world began.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
και αυ προϲκυνηϲ αυτον ϋπεϲ ειϲ ϊερου μετα χα μεγαληϲ

**English Translation**
And th[ey], having worshipped him, ret[urned] into Jeru[salem] with great j[oy].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is breathless and abbreviated, mirroring the haste of the apostles. *Au* stands for *autoi* (they), *proskunēs* for *proskunēsantes* (having worshipped). Their response to the loss of His visible presence is not despair, but adoration. They return to *Ierou*—Jerusalem, the place of sacrifice—not with weeping, but *meta cha megalēs* (with great joy). The abbreviated *cha* signifies a joy (*charas*) that transcends the written word, a joy rooted in the certainty of the Ascension.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
και ηϲαν δια παντοϲ εν τω ευλο τον ⌇﹏

**English Translation**
And they were continually in the bless[ing] the... [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Gospel concludes not with a closure, but with a continuum. They were *dia pantos* (through all things/continually) in the state of *eulo*—a fragmentation of *eulogountes* (blessing) or perhaps a confusion with *hierō* (temple). The text does not finish the sentence, trailing off into decorative squiggles. This silence is profound: the praise of the Church has no end. The scribe lays down his pen, but the *eulo*—the blessing of God—continues uninterrupted in the living temple of the faithful.
