**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω ελθειν αυτον ειϲ οικον τινοϲ τ αρχοντων φαριϲαι ϲαββατω φα αρτον και αυτοι ηϲαν παρατηρου αυτον ·

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in his coming into a house of a certain of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, and they were watching him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the setting of the snare. The Lord enters the house of the "rulers of the Pharisees" (*archontōn pharisai[ōn]*), the very seat of those who oppose the Spirit with the letter. It is the Sabbath, the day of rest, yet for them, it is a day of labor in malice. The text notes they were "watching him" (*paratērou[menoi]*). They do not look upon the Savior to be saved, but to find an accusation. He enters to eat bread (*pha[gein]*), sanctifying the table, while they sit with eyes full of judgment.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και ανθρωποϲ τιϲ ην εμπροϲθεν αυτου

**English Translation**
And a certain man was before him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is stark. It simply places a man "before him" (*emprosthen autou*). While other accounts may detail his dropsy, this Codex presents the man as a bare fact of human suffering standing in the presence of Divinity. He is the test case. He stands between the silence of the Pharisees and the mercy of the Christ. He is placed there, perhaps by the Pharisees themselves, as a living trap.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ὁ ειπεν προϲ τουϲ νομικουϲ και φα λεγων ε τω ϲαββατω θεραπευϲαι η ου

**English Translation**
And answering, the [Jesus] spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to heal or not?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord, knowing their hearts, answers their unvoiced malice. He addresses the "lawyers" (*nomikous*) and Pharisees directly. The abbreviation *pha* stands for the sect of separatists. He poses the dilemma: "Is it lawful" (*exestin*)? He forces them to articulate their cruelty. If they say "no," they condemn mercy; if they say "yes," they condemn their own tradition. The Lord exposes that their law has become an enemy to healing.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ηϲυχαϲαν και ε ϊαϲα αυτον και απελυ

**English Translation**
But they remained silent. And taking hold [of him], he healed him and released [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Their silence is their judgment. They cannot answer Truth. The Greek *e* here functions as the participle *epilabomenos* (taking hold). The Lord does not merely speak; He touches the unclean, violating their ritual purity to impart actual purity. He "healed" (*iasato*) and "released" (*apely[sen]*) him. The man is released not only from sickness but from the midst of these wolves.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και αποκριθιϲ αποκριθιϲ προϲ αυτον αυτουϲ ειπεν τινοϲ ϋμων ονοϲ η βουϲ ειϲ φρεαρ πε και ουκ ευθε αναϲπαϲει αυτ αυτ εν τη ημερα του ϲαββα

**English Translation**
And answering [answering] to him [them] he said: Of whom of you shall a donkey or an ox fall into a well, and he will not immediately pull it [it] up on the day of the Sabbath?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe’s hand trembles here, writing "answering" (*apokrithis*) twice and "it" (*aut*) twice, perhaps reflecting the stuttering confusion of the Pharisees or the urgency of the Lord's rebuke. The argument is from the lesser to the greater. They would save a beast (*onos ē bous*) for the sake of property ("immediately," *euthe[ōs]*), yet they begrudge the saving of a brother for the sake of love. They value their livestock more than the image of God.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και ουκ ϊϲχυϲ ϊϲχυϲ αποκριθηναι προϲ ταυτα

**English Translation**
And they were not able [able] to answer to these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the text repeats *ischys[an]* ("they were able"), emphasizing by duplication their utter lack of strength. The wisdom of the world is struck dumb. They have no power (*ischys*) against the Word. Silence is the only refuge for those who find their hypocrisy unveiled by the Light.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε προϲ τουϲ κεκλημενουϲ παραβολην επε πωϲ ταϲ πρω εξελεγ λεγων προϲ αυ

**English Translation**
And he was speaking a parable to those having been called, observing how they were choosing out the first [seats], saying to them:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord shifts from legal defense to moral instruction. He is "observing" (*epechōn*)—fixing His attention on their behavior. He sees them "choosing out" (*exeleg[onto]*) the "first seats" (*prō[toklisias]*). This physical jockeying for position at the table reveals the spiritual rot of pride within. He speaks to the "called" (*keklēmenous*), reminding us that being invited to the Covenant does not grant license for arrogance.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
οταν κληθηϲ ϋπο τινοϲ ειϲ γα μη κατακλι ειϲ την πρω μηπο εντιμοτεροϲ ϲου η κεκλημενοϲ ϋπ αυ

**English Translation**
Whenever you are called by anyone to marriage [feasts], do not recline into the first [seat], lest one more honorable than you be called by him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He uses the image of "marriages" (*gamous*). The prohibition is clear: "do not recline" (*mē katakli[thēs]*) in the place of honor. The danger is that someone "more honorable" (*entimoteros*) has been invited. In the Kingdom of Heaven, the saints and martyrs are the honorable ones; we, the latecomers, must not presume precedence over the patriarchs.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
και ελθων ο ϲε και αυτον καλεϲαϲ ερει ϲοι δοϲ τουτω τοπον και τοτε αρ μετα αιϲχυνηϲ τον εϲχατον το κατεχιν

**English Translation**
And coming, the one having called you and him shall say to you, 'Give place to this one,' and then you begin with shame to hold the last place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the reversal. The Host acts as the judge. The command "Give place" strips the usurper of his stolen dignity. The result is "shame" (*aischynēs*). Note the phrase "begin... to hold" (*ar[xē]... katechein*). The descent to the "last place" (*eschaton to[pon]*) is a process of public humiliation. It is better to take the lowest place voluntarily in humility than to be sent there by decree in disgrace.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ο κληθηϲ πορευ αναπεϲε ειϲ τον εϲχατον τοπ ϊνα οταν ελθη ο κεκληκωϲ ϲε κεκλη ερι ϲοι φιλε προϲαναβηθι ανωτερον τοτε ϲοι ϲοι εϲτε δοξα ενωπι παντων των ϲυνανακειμεν ϲυνανακειμεν ϲοι

**English Translation**
But whenever you are called, going, fall back into the last place, so that when the one having called you comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then to you [to you] shall be glory before all those reclining together [reclining together] with you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe again stammers with joy, repeating "to you" (*soi soi*) and "reclining together" (*synanakeimen[ōn]*). The command is to "fall back" (*anapese*) to the lowest spot. The vindication comes from the Host: "Friend, go up higher" (*prosanabēthi anōteron*). True glory (*doxa*) is that which is bestowed by God before the assembly of saints, not that which is grasped by human ambition.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
οτι παϲ ο ϋψ εαυτον ταπινω και ο ταπι εαυτον ϋψω ˙

**English Translation**
Because everyone exalting himself shall be humbled, and the one humbling himself shall be exalted.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the immutable law of the spiritual cosmos. "Exalting" (*hyps[ōn]*) leads to "humbling" (*tapeinō[thēsetai]*). This is the pattern of Lucifer who sought the heights and fell to the depths. Conversely, "humbling" (*tapein[ōn]*) leads to "exalting" (*hypsō[thēsetai]*). This is the pattern of the Christ, who descended to the Cross and was raised to the Right Hand. We must choose which pattern to imitate.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε και τω κεκληκο αυτον οταν ποι αριϲτον η διπν μη φωνει τουϲ φι ϲου μηδε τουϲ αδελφουϲ ϲου μη τουϲ ϲυγγενειϲ μηδε γιτοναϲ πλου μηποτε και αυτοι αντικαλε ϲε και γενη ανταποδομα ϲοι

**English Translation**
And he was saying also to the one having called him: When you make a breakfast or a dinner, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor [your] relatives, nor rich neighbors; lest ever they also invite you in return, and a repayment become to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord rebukes the host for the economics of his hospitality. He forbids inviting "rich neighbors" (*geitonas plou[sious]*) for the sake of reciprocity. If they "invite you in return" (*antikalesōsin*), you have received your "repayment" (*antapodoma*) on earth. The Christian must give without hope of earthly return, breaking the cycle of debt and favor that rules the world, looking instead to the resurrection of the just.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
αλλ οταν δοχ δοχ ποιηϲηϲ καλει πτωχουϲ αναπιρουϲ χωλουϲ τυφλουϲ

**English Translation**
But when you make a reception [reception], call poor [people], maimed, lame, blind.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the scribe’s hand trembles, repeating *dochen* (reception) twice, as if to emphasize the magnitude of this true hospitality. The Lord commands an inversion of the world's order. We do not feast to gain favor or repay debts of honor, but to mirror the gratuity of God. He lists the broken—the maimed and the blind—who correspond to the spiritual state of all humanity before the light of Christ. To invite them is to invite Christ, who became poor for our sake.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και μακαριοϲ εϲη οτι ουκ εχουϲιν ανταποδουναι ϲοι ανταποδοθηϲε δε γαρ ϲοι εν τη α των δι

**English Translation**
And blessed you shall be, because they have not [means] to repay you; for it shall be repaid to you in the r[esurrection] of the r[ighteous].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Codex abbreviates the great hope: *en te a[nastasei] ton di[kaion]* (in the resurrection of the righteous). The text hides the full words just as the reward is hidden from the eyes of flesh. The blessing is contingent upon the lack of earthly reciprocity. If you are paid here, you have your receipt; if you are not paid here, God Himself becomes your debtor. We wait for that final *anastasis*, where the currency is not silver, but glory.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε τιϲ ταυτα των ϲυνανα ειπ αυτω μακαριοϲ οϲτιϲ φαγεται αρτον εν τη βαϲιλει του αυτω μακαριοϲ οϲτιϲ φαγεται αρτον εν τη βαϲιλεια του

**English Translation**
Now having heard these things, a certain one of those reclining together said to him: Blessed is whoever shall eat bread in the kingdom of... [repetition] to him: Blessed is whoever shall eat bread in the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the text stammers, repeating the exclamation! This guest, reclining at the table (*synanakeimenon*), presumes he is destined for the Kingdom. He speaks a truth—blessed indeed is that eater—but he speaks it with the complacency of the Pharisee. The repetition in our manuscript serves to amplify the man's pious interruption, which prompts the Lord to shatter his confidence with the parable that follows. He assumes the banquet is for the "righteous" like himself, not knowing he must first become poor and lame in spirit to enter.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω ο δε ειπεν αυτω ανθρωποϲ τιϲ εποιει διπνον μεγα και εκαλεϲ πολλουϲ

**English Translation**
But he said to him [repetition: but he said to him]: A certain man was making a great supper and invited many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the sacred page doubles the introduction: *ho de eipen auto*. The Lord turns with emphasis. The "certain man" is the Father; the "great supper" is the economy of salvation, prepared since the foundation of the world. He "invited many"—this refers to the people of Israel, called through the Law and the Prophets. The invitation was long-standing, but the response was yet to be tested.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και απε τον δουλ αυτου τη ωρα του διπνου ειπειν τοιϲ κεκλημενοιϲ ερ οτι ηδη ετοι ειϲιν

**English Translation**
And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to those having been invited: Come, because [things] are already ready.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "hour of the supper" is the fullness of time, the Incarnation. The servant (*doulos*) is Christ Himself, taking the form of a slave, or perhaps the apostolic choir sent to proclaim that the prophecies are fulfilled. The message is urgent: *Hede etoima* (already ready). There is no more waiting for the Messiah; He is the feast. To delay now is to reject the reality for the shadow.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και ηρξ ηρξ απο μιαϲ παν παρετιϲθαι παραιτιϲθαι ο πρωτοϲ ειπεν αυ αγρον ηγοραϲα και εχω αναγκην εξελθων ϊδειν αυτον ερωτω ε ϲε εχε με παρητημεν

**English Translation**
And they began [repetition] from one [voice] all to excuse themselves [correction]. The first said to him: I bought a field and have necessity, going out, to see it; I ask you, have me excused.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text shows the unanimity of rejection—*apo mias* (from one mind). The first man is bound by *philoktemosyne* (love of possession). He bought a field (*agron*). He claims "necessity" (*anagken*), but it is a false necessity. He goes "out" (*exelthon*)—a movement away from the center, away from God. He prefers the earth he purchased to the heaven offered freely.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και ετεροϲ ειπεν ζευγη βοων ηγο πεντε και πο δοκιμαϲαι αυτα ερωτω ϲε ε με παρητημε ˙

**English Translation**
And another said: I bought five yoke of oxen and am going to prove them; I ask you, have me excused.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The second is ensnared by the senses or perhaps the cares of labor. The "five yoke" may signify the five senses, which, when yoked to the earth, drag the soul downward. He goes to "prove" (*dokimasai*) them, placing his trust in his own commerce and strength rather than proving the will of God. He asks to be excused, polite in word but rebellious in deed.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και ετεροϲ ει γυναικα εγη και δια τουτο ου δυναμαι ελθιν

**English Translation**
And another said: I married a wife, and because of this I cannot come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The third represents carnal attachment. Unlike the others who asked to be excused, this one declares an impossibility: *ou dynamai* (I cannot). He has bound himself to flesh and blood. While marriage is honorable, here it becomes an idol, a rival to the wedding feast of the Lamb. He uses a holy ordinance as a shield against the Holy One.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και παραγενομενοϲ ο δουλοϲ απηγγιλ τω αυτου ταυτα τοτε οργιϲθειϲ ο οι ειπ τω δουλω αυτου ε ταχεωϲ ειϲ ταϲ πλατειαϲ και ρυ τηϲ πολεωϲ και τουϲ κ(αι) οϲουϲ εαν ευρητε και τουϲ πτωχουϲ και αναπιρουϲ και τυφλουϲ και χωλουϲ · ειϲα ωδε

**English Translation**
And having arrived, the servant reported these things to his [lord]. Then being angry, the householder said to his servant: Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and the... and as many as you might find, and the poor and maimed and blind and lame bring in here.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master’s anger (*orgistheis*) is the zeal of rejected love. He turns to the "streets and lanes"—the public places where the despised gather. The Sinaiticus text here is rugged, adding "and as many as you might find" (*hosous ean heurete*), emphasizing the indiscriminate nature of this second call. These are the sinners within Israel, the publicans and harlots, physically and spiritually "maimed," who know their need for the Physician.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ο δουλοϲ γεγο ο επεταξαϲ κ(αι) ετι τοποϲ εϲτιν

**English Translation**
And the servant said: It has been done, what you commanded, and still there is room.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Eti topos estin* (still there is room). The capacity of God's house exceeds human imagination. Grace is not exhausted by the number of the saved. The servant's report shows the efficiency of the divine will—"it has been done"—yet the void remains, aching to be filled by the Gentiles.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ο προϲ τ δουλον ι εξελθε ειϲ ταϲ οδουϲ και φραγμουϲ και αναγ ειϲελθειν ϊ γεμιϲθη μου ο οικοϲ

**English Translation**
And the [Lord] said to the servant: Go out into the roads and hedges and compel [them] to enter, that my house may be filled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Now the command goes beyond the city walls, to the "roads and hedges" (*phragmous*)—the wild places of the Gentiles. The command *anagkason* (compel) does not imply violence, but the powerful constraint of the Spirit and the sheer force of truth. We must "compel" the pagans not with swords, but with the overwhelming evidence of God's love, dragging them from the hedges of idolatry into the shelter of the Church. The goal is the *pleroma*: that the house be filled.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
λεγω γαρ ϋμ ϋμ οτι ουδιϲ των αν εκειν των κεκλημεν γευϲεται μου του διπνου

**English Translation**
For I say to you [repetition]: that no one of those men, the ones having been invited, shall taste of my supper.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful seal upon the parable. The repetition *hymin hymin* (to you, to you) in our Codex strikes the ear like a gavel. Those who were first invited—who relied on their fields, oxen, and lineage—are excluded not by God's lack of mercy, but by their own choice. They shall not "taste" (*geusetai*) the banquet; they will know of it, but never savor its sweetness. This is the definition of hell: to be outside the feast of existence, eternally busy with one's own empty fields.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ϲυνεπορευοντο δε αυτω οχλοι πολλοι και ϲτραφιϲ ειπεν προϲ αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
Now great crowds were traveling with him, and having turned, he said to them:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the nature of the multitude. They journey *with* Him (ϲυνεπορευοντο), caught in the fervor of His miracles, yet they follow only physically. The Lord turns (ϲτραφιϲ) to face them, checking their easy enthusiasm. He does not flatter the crowd to increase their number; He turns to confront them with the terror of the narrow way. Proximity to the Holy One is not yet discipleship; one must withstand His face turned upon them in judgment and truth.


**Verse 26**
[Verse: 26]

**Greek Text**
ει τιϲ ερχεται προϲ εμε και ου μιϲει τον πα αυτου και την μητερα και την γυ και τα τεκνα και τουϲ αδελφουϲ και ταϲ αδελφαϲ ετι δε και την ψυχ εαυτου ου δυναται ειναι μου μαθη

**English Translation**
If anyone comes to me and does not hate his [father] and the mother and the [wife] and the children and the brothers and the sisters, and still further even the [soul] of himself, he cannot be my [disciple].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the sword that divides. The Lord demands a "hatred" (μιϲει) not of malice, but of priority. The natural affections—for the father (πα), the wife (γυ), and the kin—are bonds of the flesh. If these bonds tether the soul to the earth when Christ calls it to heaven, they must be severed. Nay, more: one must hate his own *psyche* (ψυχ), his very life-breath and self-preservation. Unless the love of God consumes all lesser loves, rendering them as nothing in comparison, the capacity to be a learner (μαθη) of the Mysteries is absent.


**Verse 27**
[Verse: 27]

**Greek Text**
και οϲτιϲ ου βαϲτα τον ϲταυρον αυτου και ερχεται οπιϲω μου ου δυ ειναι μου μαθητηϲ

**English Translation**
And whoever does not [carry] his cross and come after me, [can]not be my disciple.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cross is not a mere tribulation; it is the wood of execution. To "carry" (βαϲτα) it is to walk as a man already dead to the world, marching toward his own Golgotha. The text is absolute: without this burden, one has no power (ου δυ) to exist as a disciple. There is no comfort here for the lukewarm; the path behind Him (οπιϲω μου) is paved with the renunciation of life itself.


**Verse 28**
[Verse: 28]

**Greek Text**
τιϲ γαρ εξ ϋμων θελων πυργον οι ουχι πρωτον καθιϲαϲ ψηφιζει την δα ει εχει τα ειϲ απαρτιϲμον

**English Translation**
For who among you, wanting to [build] a tower, does not first, having sat down, count the [cost], if he has the things for completion?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Christian life is a high tower (πυργον), a structure of virtue rising toward the heavens. It requires deliberation. One must sit and calculate with pebbles (ψηφιζει) the expense (δα). Do you possess the spiritual capital—the endurance, the faith, the grace—to finish? To begin without reckoning is the mark of a rash spirit. We must measure our poverty against God's treasury before we lay the first stone.


**Verse 29**
[Verse: 29]

**Greek Text**
ϊνα μηποτε θεν αυτου θεμελι και μη ϊϲχυοντοϲ εκτελεϲαι παντεϲ οι θεωρουντεϲ αρ αυτω εμ

**English Translation**
Lest perhaps, having [laid] its [foundation] and not having strength to finish, all those beholding [begin] to [mock] him,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the shame of the unfinished work. To lay the foundation (θεμελι)—perhaps through baptism or initial repentance—is easy. But if the will fails and one lacks the strength (ϊϲχυοντοϲ) to perfect the life of holiness, the demons and the world stand ready to mock (εμ). The half-Christian is a spectacle of ridicule, having abandoned the world but failed to reach the Kingdom, left desolate in the ruins of his own intentions.


**Verse 30**
[Verse: 30]

**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ ο ουτοϲ ο ανθρω ηρξατο οικο και ουκ ϊϲχυ εκτελεϲαι

**English Translation**
Saying, 'This [man] began to [build] and did not have strength to finish.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verdict is harsh and precise. The accusers identify the failure: he "began" (ηρξατο). Many begin, few conclude. The tragedy lies in the lack of power (ουκ ϊϲχυ) to bring the work to its *telos*. In the eyes of the Church, intention without completion is a monument to folly. Let us not be men who merely begin.


**Verse 31**
[Verse: 31]

**Greek Text**
η τιϲ βαϲιλευϲ πορευο ετερω βαϲι ϲυμβαλλειν ειϲ πολεμον ουχι κα πρωτον βου ει δυνατοϲ εϲτιν εν δεκα χιλι ϋπαντηϲαι τω μετα εικοϲι χει ερχομε επ αυτον

**English Translation**
Or what king, going to engage another [king] in war, does not, [sitting] first, [counsel] if he is able with ten [thousand] to meet the one coming against him with twenty [thousand]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We are at war. The adversary—be it the devil or the overwhelming judgment of God—approaches with superior force (twenty thousand). The wise soul, the king of his own heart, must sit in council (βου). Can our meager virtues (the ten thousand) withstand the onslaught? This parable teaches humility; we are outmatched by the powers arrayed against us. We cannot win this war by our own strength.


**Verse 32**
[Verse: 32]

**Greek Text**
ει δε μη γε ετι αυτου πορ οντοϲ πρεϲβει αποϲτιλαϲ ερω ερωτα τα προϲ ειρηνην

**English Translation**
And if not, while he is still [far] off, having sent an embassy, he [asks] the things for peace.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Since we cannot defeat the approaching Power by our own might, we must sue for peace. While the Judge is yet far off (πορ), in this span of life granted to us, we send the embassy (πρεϲβει) of prayer and repentance. We do not fight God; we submit. We ask for the terms of peace (ειρηνην), which is reconciliation through grace, acknowledging our inability to triumph in the battle on our own merits.


**Verse 33**
[Verse: 33]

**Greek Text**
ου ουν παϲ εξ υμ οϲ ουκ αποταϲϲε παϲι τοιϲ εαυ ου δυναται ειναι μου μαθητηϲ ·

**English Translation**
So therefore, everyone of you who does not [renounce] all his own [things], cannot be my disciple.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the summary (ουν) of the cost. The condition is total renunciation (αποταϲϲε). He does not say "some," but "all the things of himself" (παϲι τοιϲ εαυ). Whether wealth, status, or will, anything retained is a weight that prevents the carrying of the cross. The disciple must be empty of self to be filled with Christ.


**Verse 34**
[Verse: 34]

**Greek Text**
κα ουν το αλα αλαϲ ε δε και το αλα αλαϲ μωρανθη εν τι αρτυθηϲεται

**English Translation**
[Good] therefore [is] the salt; but if even the salt becomes foolish, with what shall it be seasoned?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Salt (αλαϲ) is the grace of the Spirit and the wisdom of the disciple, meant to preserve the earth from corruption. But the text warns of a terrifying possibility: the salt can become "foolish" (μωρανθη)—it can lose its savor, its very nature. A Christian who loses the distinct bitterness of the cross and the flavor of truth becomes an absurdity, a contradiction in terms. Once this grace is lost, there is no earthly agent that can restore it.


**Verse 35**
[Verse: 35]

**Greek Text**
ουτε ειϲ γην ουτε ειϲ κοπριαν ευθε εϲτιν εξω βαλ αυτο ˙ ὁ εχ ‾̷‾ ωτα ακουειν ακου ˙

**English Translation**
Neither for the land nor for the dunghill is it [fit]; they cast it out. He who [has] ears to hear, let him hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final judgment on the tasteless disciple is absolute rejection. Such a one is useless even for the manure pile (κοπριαν)—he cannot even serve to fertilize the ground. He is fit only to be cast out (εξω βαλ). The Lord closes with the solemn formula: "He who has ears." Not all hear this hard doctrine. Only the circumcised ear, opened by the Spirit, can tremble at this warning and seek to retain the savor of God.
