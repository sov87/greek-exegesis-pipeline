**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲηλθεν πα ειϲ ϲυναγω και ην εκει α εξηραμμε εχων την χειρα

**English Translation**
And he entered again into synagogue, and there was there a man having the hand withered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He returns to the place of the law, finding within it the withered fruit of human nature. The synagogue holds the man, yet cannot heal him, demonstrating that the letter alone leaves the member lifeless. The withered hand symbolizes works that have dried up, unable to stretch forth in righteousness until Grace enters.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και παρετηρουν αυτον ει εν τοιϲ ϲαββαϲι θεραπευει αυτον ϊνα κατη αυτου

**English Translation**
And they were watching him if on the Sabbaths he heals him, in order that they might accuse him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eyes of malice are sharper than the eyes of faith, yet they see nothing true. They observe the Lord of the Sabbath only to entrap him by the Sabbath, seeking an accusation in a work of mercy. Their vigilance proves that their own observance has become a chain of cruelty rather than a rest in God.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει τω α τω την ξηραν χι εχοντι εγειρε ειϲ το μεϲον

**English Translation**
And he says to the man having the withered hand: Rise into the midst.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He commands the infirmity to stand in the center, making the hidden suffering visible to all the assembly. By calling the man into the midst, he forces the accusers to look upon the humanity they would ignore for the sake of a rule. The cure begins with the public confession of the need before the face of judgment.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ ε τοιϲ ϲαβ αγαθον ποι · η κακοποι · ψυχην ϲω η αποκτιναι οι δε εϲιωπων ˙

**English Translation**
And he says to them: Is it lawful on the Sabbaths to do good or to do evil? To save a life or to kill? But they remained silent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
His question pierces the silence of their malice, revealing that to refuse to save when able is effectively to kill. The Sabbath is established for the preservation of life, not its destruction through negligence. Their silence condemns them, for they have no answer to the divine necessity of goodness.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και περιβλεψα αυτουϲ με οργηϲ ϲυνλυπου επι τη πω τηϲ καρδι αυτων λεγει τω ˙ εκ την χιρα ϲου · και εξετινεν και απεκατεϲταθη η χιρ αυτου

**English Translation**
And having looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their heart, he says to the man: Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine anger and grief coexist as responses to the obstinacy of the heart, which is a harder malady than the withered bone. He commands the impossible—to stretch out what is dead—and in the obedience of the attempt, power is given. The restoration is immediate, rebuking the spiritual paralysis of the watchers.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθοντεϲ οι φαριϲαιοι ευθυϲ με των ηρωδια ϲυμβουλιον εποιηϲαν κατ αυ οπωϲ αυτον απολεϲωϲιν

**English Translation**
And the Pharisees having gone out, immediately with the Herodians made counsel against him, how they might destroy him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Light drives the darkness to conspire; the Pharisees ally with the Herodians, uniting religious pride with worldly power against the Truth. They leave the presence of the miracle not to worship, but to plot destruction. The healing of a brother incites them to the murder of the Healer.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και ο μετα των μαθητων αυτου ανεχωρηϲεν προϲ την θαλαϲϲαν και πολυ πληθοϲ απο τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ και απο τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ ηκολουθηϲαν

**English Translation**
And he with his disciples withdrew to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee and from Judea followed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He retreats not from duty but from fruitless hostility, moving to the open sea where the people thirst for him. The rigid walls of the synagogue are left for the fluid shore. From Galilee and Judea they come, drawn by the presence that the legalists rejected.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) απο ϊεροϲολυμ κ(αι) απο τηϲ ϊδουμ(αι)αϲ και περαν του ϊορ και περι τυρον και ϲιδωνα πλη πολυ ακουον οϲα εποιει ηλ προϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
And from Jerusalem and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing as many things as he was doing, came to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The boundaries of the nations dissolve before the report of his works. Jerusalem joins with Idumea, and the faithful with those from Tyre and Sidon. Hearing is the precursor to coming; the rumor of his power gathers the scattered children into one body around him, transcending the limits of the law.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν τοιϲ μα αυτου ϊνα πλοιαριον προϲ αυτω δια τον οχλον ϊνα μη θλιβωϲιν αυτον

**English Translation**
And he spoke to his disciples that a small boat should wait on him because of the crowd, so that they might not press upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The zeal of the crowd threatens to overwhelm the order of the ministry. He employs the boat as a separation to maintain the distinction between the teacher and the taught. To avoid being crushed by the fleshly desires of the mob, he teaches from the water, preserving his authority.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
πολλουϲ γαρ εθε ωϲτε επιπιπτειν αυτω ϊνα αυτου αψων οϲοι ειχον μα μαϲ

**English Translation**
For he healed many, so that they were falling upon him in order that they might touch him, as many as had scourges.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scourges of the body drive the soul to desperation, seeking contact with the Holy One. They fall upon him, knowing that life flows from his very person and not merely his words. It is a violent seizing of the kingdom, where faith is expressed through the urgent touch of the suffering.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και τα τα ακα οταν αυτ εθεωρουν προϲε αυτω και εκραζον λεγοντεϲ λεγοντα λεγοντεϲ οτι ϲυ ει ο του

**English Translation**
And the [spirits], the unclean [ones], whenever they beheld him, fell before him and cried out, saying, saying, saying that: You are the [Son] of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the demons are compelled to bow and confess the reality of his nature. Their frantic repetition betrays their terror and their knowledge. They recognize the Son of God not by love, but by the torment of his holiness which burns against their uncleanness.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και πολλα επετιμα αυτοιϲ ϊνα μη αυ φανερον ποι

**English Translation**
And he rebuked them much, that they should not make him manifest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He refuses the testimony of the darkness, for the Truth must be received by faith, not by the proclamation of devils. He silences their knowledge to protect the mystery of his mission. It is not for the unclean to declare the Holy One to the world, but for the disciples.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και ανα ειϲ το οροϲ και προϲκαλειται ουϲ ηθελεν αυτοϲ οι δε απηλθον προϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
And he goes up into the mountain and calls whom he himself wanted; and they went away to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the sovereignty of the Lord in election. He ascends the mountain, separating Himself from the plain of common life to the height of divine communion, and from that summit, He calls not those who volunteered, but those whom "he himself wanted." The response of the called is absolute; they do not merely listen, but they depart from their former stations and go away to Him, making Him their new center and destination.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και εποιηϲεν · · ουϲ και αποϲτο ωνομαϲεν ϊνα ωϲι μετ αυτου και ϊνα αποϲτελλη αυτουϲ κηρυϲϲε

**English Translation**
And he made [them]—whom also apostles he named—in order that they might be with him and in order that he might send them to preach.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The constitution of this holy band has a dual purpose, ordered by divine wisdom. First, He made them to "be with him," for discipleship requires dwelling in the presence of the Master to absorb His life. Only after this communion are they sent out; the naming of them as "apostles" signifies this second movement, where the intake of grace transforms into the output of proclamation.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και εχειν εξουϲι εκβαλλειν τα δαι

**English Translation**
And to have authority to cast out the demons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The preaching of the kingdom is accompanied by power over the kingdom of darkness. The Lord does not send them out defenseless but grants them "authority," a delegation of His own rights over the spiritual realm. To cast out the demons is the visible sign that the dominion of the enemy is being dismantled by the servants of the True King.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και εποιη τουϲ · · και επεθηκεν ο · τω ϲιμωνι πετρον

**English Translation**
And he made the [twelve]; and he placed the [name] on Simon: Peter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the making of this company, the Lord exercises the Creator's right to rename His creature. He places the name Peter upon Simon, signifying a change in nature and destiny. The rock is identified not by flesh and blood, but by the imposition of the Master's word, establishing a foundation that was not there by birth.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και ϊακωβον τον του ζεβεδαιου και ϊωαννην τον αδελφον του ϊακωβου · και ε αυτοιϲ ονοματα · βοανηρ · ο εϲτιν ϋϊοι βρ βρ

**English Translation**
And James the [son] of Zebedee and John the brother of James; and he [placed] on them names, Boanerges, which is Sons of Thunder.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
These brothers are united not only by blood but by a shared spiritual designation. The title "Sons of Thunder" reveals the character of their witness—powerful, resounding, and originating from the heavens. As thunder follows lightning, so their proclamation follows the light of Christ, announcing the coming storm of judgment and grace upon the world.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και ανδραιαν ανδρεαν και φιλιππον και βαρθολομαι και ματθαιον και θωμαν και ϊακωβον τον του αλφαιου και θαδδαιον και ϲιμωνα τον καναναιον

**English Translation**
And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The roll call of the faithful servants includes diverse origins, binding them into one body. By listing them individually, the Spirit affirms that the call is personal; each man is known and summoned by name. From James to the Zealot Simon, natural temperaments and earthly allegiances are subsumed under the single allegiance to the One who called them.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και ϊουδαν ϊϲκαριωθʼ οϲ και παρεδωκ αυτον

**English Translation**
And Judas Iscarioth, who also betrayed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A shadow falls upon the list of the elect. Judas is numbered among the apostles, yet his description is forever bound to his treachery. That he was chosen while known to be the one who would "betray him" demonstrates the unfathomable patience of God, who endures the presence of the traitor to fulfill the economy of salvation.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και ερχεται ερχονται ειϲ οικον και ϲυνερχεται πα ο οχλοϲ ωϲτε μη δυναϲθαι αυ μητε αρτον φαγιν

**English Translation**
And they come into a house; and the crowd comes together again, so that they were not able not even to eat bread.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The entry into the house offers no respite, for the need of the multitude is voracious. The crowd presses in with such urgency that the basic sustenance of life—eating bread—is set aside. This illustrates the consuming nature of ministry: the spiritual hunger of the world devours the leisure of the servant, and the bread of the body is neglected for the work of the soul.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και ακουϲ οι παρ αυτου εξηλθον κρατηϲαι αυτον ελεγον γαρ οτι εξεϲτη

**English Translation**
And those belonging to him, hearing, went out to seize him; for they were saying that he is beside himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Proximity to the Lord does not guarantee understanding of His mystery. Those of His own kin, judging by worldly standards, mistake divine ecstasy for madness. They seek to "seize him" to restrain the Spirit's work, proving that carnal affection often becomes an adversary to spiritual mission when it seeks to control what it cannot comprehend.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και οι γραμματειϲ οι απο ϊεροϲολυ καταβαντεϲ ελεγον οτι βεελ εχει και ο εν τω αρχοντι των δαιμονιων εκβαλλει τα δαι

**English Translation**
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying that he has Beelzebul, and that by the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the blasphemy of the learned. Those from Jerusalem, the seat of religious knowledge, descend into the deepest error by attributing the works of Light to the Prince of Darkness. To say "he has Beelzebul" is to look upon the face of Mercy and call it a demon; it is the ultimate inversion of truth, born of a heart hardened against the Spirit.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲα αυτουϲ εν παραβολαιϲ ελεγ ελεγ αυτοιϲ πωϲ δυνα ϲαταναϲ ϲατα εκβαλλειν

**English Translation**
And calling them, in parables he said to them: How is Satan able to cast out Satan?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord condescends to answer malice with reason. He calls the accusers near and exposes the absurdity of their claim through a question. Evil, though chaotic, possesses a consistent will for destruction; it does not sabotage its own conquests. If Satan casts out Satan, he violates the nature of his own kingdom, rendering the accusation illogical.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και εαν βαϲιλεια εφ εαυτην μεριϲ ου δυναται ϲτα ϲταθηναι η βαϲιλεια εκεινη

**English Translation**
And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is a universal axiom of dominion: internal division is the harbinger of collapse. If the demonic realm were at war with itself, it would already be ruined. Therefore, the casting out of demons must proceed from a superior Kingdom, one that is external to and stronger than the house of the strong man, signifying the arrival of the Kingdom of God.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και εαν οικια εφ εαυτην μεριϲθη ου δυνη η οικια εκει ϲταθηναι

**English Translation**
And if a house is divided against itself, that house is not able to stand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The domestic structure depends entirely upon internal cohesion. When division (*meristhē*) enters the fabric of the "house," its capacity to endure (*stathēnai*) is instantly nullified. Disunity is not merely a weakness but the structural cause of collapse; nothing partitioned against its own nature can maintain its upright position.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και ει ο ϲαταναϲ α εφ εαυτ κ(αι) εμεριϲθη και ου δυναται ϲτηναι · αλλα τελοϲ εχει

**English Translation**
And if Satan rose up against himself and was divided, he is not able to stand, but has an end.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the adversary is bound by the laws of unity; civil war within the demonic realm signals its dissolution. If Satan were to assault his own foundation, he does not merely stumble but possesses a definitive "end" (*telos*). Evil, when turned inward, becomes the engine of its own cessation.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
αλλ ου δυναται ου ειϲελθων ειϲ την οικιαν του ϊ τα ϲκευη αυτου διαρπαϲαι · εαν μη πρωτον τον ϊϲχυρον δηϲη και τοτε την οικι αυτου διαρπα

**English Translation**
But no one is able, having entered into the house of the [strong man], to plunder his vessels, unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "strong man" holds possession of his goods (*skeuē*) until a greater force enters. The act of binding (*dēsē*) must precede the act of plundering; spoliation is the proof of the binder's superiority. One cannot liberate the vessels without first immobilizing the usurper who guards them.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι παντα αφεθη τοιϲ ϋϊοιϲ τ ανοιϲ α τα αμαρτη και αι βλαϲφη οϲα αν βλαϲ

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you that all things will be forgiven to the sons of men, the sins and the blasphemies, as many as they might blaspheme.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scope of divine remission is vast, covering "all things" (*panta*) belonging to human frailty. Both the actions ("sins") and the speeches ("blasphemies") of the sons of men fall within this horizon of mercy. There is no quantity of human error that inherently exceeds the capacity for forgiveness, provided it remains within the human sphere.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
οϲ δ αν βλαϲφημη ειϲ το π το α ουκ εχι αφε ειϲ τον αιω αλλα ενοχοϲ εϲται αιωνιου α

**English Translation**
But whoever blasphemes against the [Holy Spirit] has not forgiveness into the age, but will be guilty of an eternal [sin].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the terrifying exception: a specific trajectory of speech directed against the Spirit (*pneuma*) locks the speaker out of remission "into the age." The guilt incurred is not transient but "eternal" (*aiōniou*), binding the soul to a debt that time cannot erode. To speak against the Source of forgiveness is to sever the very lifeline of grace.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ο ελεγον α εχει

**English Translation**
Because they were saying: He has [an unclean spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eternal guilt is rooted in this specific accusation: attributing the Holy presence to an unclean (*akatharton*) possession. By declaring that "He has" a demon, they define the Holy One by the very evil He destroys. It is the ultimate inversion of truth, calling light darkness, which seals their condemnation.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και ερχεται η αυτου και οι αδελ αυτου · και εξω ϲταντεϲ απεϲτι προϲ αυτον καλουντεϲ αυτ αυτ

**English Translation**
And His [mother] comes and His brothers; and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Natural kinship places the family "outside" (*exō*) the circle of grace. They do not enter but "send" to Him, attempting to exert authority from a distance. Their posture is one of separation; they stand without, while the true work proceeds within.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και εκαθητο προϲ περι περι αυτον οχλοϲ και λεγουϲιν αυτω ϊ η ϲου και οι αδελφοι ϲου ε ζητουϲιν ϲε

**English Translation**
And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they say to Him: Behold, Your [mother] and Your brothers [outside] seek You.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "crowd" physically encircles Him, creating a barrier between the Lord and His blood relations. The announcement contrasts those who "seek" Him from the outside with those who are already seated "around" (*peri*) Him. The urgent seeking of the family is juxtaposed with the restful sitting of the disciples.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ αυ λεγει τιϲ εϲτ εϲτ η μ μου και οι αδελφοι μου

**English Translation**
And answering them, He says: Who is My [mother] and My brothers?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He suspends the natural order with a question. By asking "Who is...?", He indicates that biological ties are no longer self-evident or binding. The definition of family is about to be radically redrawn, moving from the flesh to the spirit.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και περιβλεψαμενοϲ τουϲ περι αυτον κυκλω καθημε λεγει ειδε η μου και οι α μου ·

**English Translation**
And having looked around at those sitting in a circle around Him, He says: Behold My [mother] and My [brothers].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gaze (*periblepsamenos*) of the Lord consecrates the new family. Those sitting in the "circle" (*kyklō*) of instruction replace the lineage of blood. Proximity to the Word constitutes the true maternal and fraternal bond; to sit at His feet is to share His life.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ αν ποιηϲη το θε του ουτοϲ αδελφοϲ μου και αδελφη και εϲτιν

**English Translation**
For whoever does the [will] of [God], this one is My brother and sister and [mother].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The singular criterion for this new kinship is obedience: doing the "will" (*thelēma*) of God. This action creates a bond stronger than nature, encompassing all familial roles—brother, sister, mother. The spiritual family is open to "whoever" acts in accordance with the divine purpose.
