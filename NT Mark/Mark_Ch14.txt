**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
ην δε το πα και τα αζυμα ε̣ζυμα με δυο ημεραϲ και εζητουν οι αρχϊεριϲ και οι γραμματιϲ πωϲ αυτον εν δολω κρα αποκτι

**English Translation**
Now it was the Pascha and the unleavened unleavened [bread] after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how, having seized him by guile, they might kill [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred season approaches, marked by the bread without leaven, signifying purity; yet the leaders of the people seek to pollute the feast with the leaven of malice. They plot to seize him not with open authority, but by guile, hiding their murderous intent beneath the shadow of the law. The Pascha, which brings life, is here the backdrop for those plotting death.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ελεγον γαρ μη εν τη εορτη μηποτε εϲται θο του λαου

**English Translation**
For they were saying, "Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the fear of men outweighs the fear of God in their councils. They do not dread the eye of the Almighty during the holy feast, but rather the uproar of the multitude. Their hesitation arises not from piety, but from a calculation of public order, proving they serve the crowd rather than the truth.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και οντοϲ αυτου εν βη εν τη οικια ϲι του λεπρου κατακειμενου αυ ηλθεν γυνη ε αλαβαϲτρον μυρου ναρδου πι πολυτελουϲ ϲυντριψαϲα τον την α · κατεχε αυτου τηϲ κεφα ·

**English Translation**
And he being in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he reclined, a woman came having an alabaster [flask] of myrrh, of nard, genuine, very costly; having broken the the alabaster, she poured [it] down on his head.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He dwells in the house of Simon the leper, showing that no uncleanliness drives him away. The woman brings genuine nard, holding nothing back, as seen in the breaking of the vessel itself. She pours it down upon his head, anointing him as King and Priest, offering the very costly gift to the One who is beyond price.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε τινεϲ αγανακτουντεϲ προϲ αυτουϲ εαυτουϲ ειϲ τι η απωλια αυτη του μυρου γεγονεν ·

**English Translation**
But there were some being indignant among themselves, "For what [purpose] has this destruction of the myrrh happened?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The carnal mind views sacrifice to God as destruction. These indignant ones call the outpouring of love "apoleia"—loss or waste. They see the material substance vanishing and fail to perceive the spiritual offering ascending; to them, what is given to the Lord is lost, whereas in truth, only what is kept is lost.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
η γαρ το μυρ πραθηναι επανω δηναριων τριακο και δοθηνε τοιϲ πτωχοιϲ και ενεβριμουντο αυ ·

**English Translation**
For the myrrh could have been sold for above three hundred denarii and given to the poor; and they were grumbling at her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They assess the value of the myrrh at three hundred denarii, measuring the gift by silver rather than by the heart. They claim care for the poor to mask their coldness toward the Master. Their grumbling reveals that they prefer a charity that costs them nothing over a devotion that consumes everything.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν α αυτην τι αυτη κοπουϲ παρεχετε καλον γαρ εργον ηργαϲατο ειργαϲατο εν εμοι ·

**English Translation**
But he said, "Leave her alone; why do you cause trouble for her? For she wrought wrought a good work in me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He commands them to cease troubling the woman, affirming the repetition of her labor—she "wrought wrought" this deed. It is a good work because it is centered "in me," that is, in Christ Himself. Works done directly for the honor of his person possess a dignity that silences the calculations of utility.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
παντοτε γαρ τουϲ πτωχουϲ εχετε μεθ εαυτων και οταν θελητε δυνα αυτοιϲ παντοτε ευ ποιηϲαι · ε δε ου παντοτε εχετε ·

**English Translation**
For always you have the poor with yourselves, and whenever you wish you are able always to do good to them; but me you do not always have.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He distinguishes between the perpetual presence of the poor and his own temporary physical sojourn. The opportunity for common charity remains always, awaiting the will of the giver; but the opportunity to honor the Incarnate Lord in the flesh is fleeting. He claims a priority that transcends the poor, for he is the source of all good.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ο εϲχεν ε προελα μυριϲαι το ϲω μου ειϲ τον εν ·

**English Translation**
What she had, [she did]; she anticipated to anoint my body for the burial.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She acted according to her capacity, giving "what she had." More profoundly, she acted prophetically; she anticipated the death that others ignore. She anoints his body not merely for refreshment but for the burial, recognizing the mortality of the flesh he assumed for our sake.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
αμην δε λεγω υμ υμ οπου εαν κηρυ το ευαγγελι ευαγγελι ειϲ ολον τον κοϲμ και ο εποιηϲεν αυτη λαληθηϲε ειϲ μνημοϲυ αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
But amen I say to you you, wherever the gospel gospel is preached into the whole world, also what she did shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double emphasis on "you" and "gospel" confirms the certainty of the promise. The proclamation of the gospel into the whole world carries within it the memory of this woman's deed. Her act of private devotion is elevated to a universal memorial, inseparable from the saving message itself.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ϊου ο ϊϲκαριωθ ο ειϲ των δωδεκα απηλ προϲ τουϲ αρ ϊνα αυτον παραδω αυτοιϲ ·

**English Translation**
And Judas Iscariot, the one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, in order that he might betray him to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The title "the one of the twelve" sharpens the sting of the betrayal; the enemy is within the inner circle. Judas departs from the presence of the Light to conspire with the chief priests. His movement is purposeful, intending to hand over the Master to those who seek his life.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ακουϲαντεϲ εχαρηϲαν και α επηγγιλαντο επηγγιλαντο αυτω αργυριον δουναι · και εζητι πωϲ αυ ευκαιρωϲ πα ·

**English Translation**
And they, having heard, rejoiced, and promised promised to give him silver; and he was seeking how he might conveniently betray him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The priests rejoice at the news of treachery, a perverse joy in evil. The promise is doubled—"promised promised"—sealing the pact of blood for silver. Judas then seeks a "convenient" time, looking for an opportunity where the act of betrayal can be accomplished with ease, fitting the schedule of hell.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και τη πρω ημερα των α οτε το πα εθυον λεγου αυτω οι μαθη αυτου που θε απελθοντεϲ ε ϊ φαγηϲ το πα ·

**English Translation**
And on the first day of the unleavened [bread], when they were sacrificing the Pascha, his disciples say to him, "Where do you wish [that] having gone we should prepare that you may eat the Pascha?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The time is fixed by the sacrifice of the Pascha, the shadow of the true Sacrifice to come. The disciples ask where to prepare the meal, acknowledging his authority to determine the place. They prepare to eat the lamb, not knowing that the Lamb of God prepares to offer himself.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και αποϲτελ δυο των μαθη αυτοιϲ αυτου αυτου και λε αυτοιϲ ϋπαγε ειϲ την πολιν και απαντηϲι ϋμ ϋμ ανθρωποϲ κεραμι ϋδατοϲ βαϲτα · ακολουθηϲα αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And he sends two of the disciples [to them of him of him] and says to them: Go into the city, and there will meet [you you] a man carrying a jar of water; follow him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master exercises sovereignty over the city and its inhabitants, foreseeing the meeting with the man carrying the water jar. The repetition in the text, "to them of him of him," emphasizes the intimate possession the Lord holds over the disciples he sends. The command is singular and absolute: they must follow the water-bearer, for the path to the prepared place is found through obedience to the specific sign given by the Lord.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και οπου εαν ειϲελθη ειπα τω οικοδεϲπο οτι ο διδαϲκα λεγει · που εϲτ εϲτ το καταλυμα μου οπου το παϲχα με των μαθητ μου φαγω ·

**English Translation**
And wherever he enters, say to the house-master that the Teacher says: Where [is is] my guest-room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The title "the Teacher" carries sufficient authority to command the "house-master," requiring no further identification. The repetition "is is" underscores the reality of the place already existing in the divine plan. The "guest-room" is claimed by the Teacher as "my" room, consecrated for the specific purpose of eating the Passover with his disciples, separating this meal from all common usage.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και αυ ϋμιν δειξει α μεγα ε ετοι · κακει ετοι ημιν ·

**English Translation**
And he will show you [an upper room] large [furnished] [ready]; and there prepare for us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The room is described by three attributes: it is an upper room, it is large, and it is ready. The largeness indicates the sufficiency of the space for the mysteries to be celebrated. The readiness signifies that the spiritual provision precedes the arrival of the disciples. Their duty is to "prepare" in the place already marked out by the Lord's foreknowledge.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και εξηλθον οι μαθη κ(αι) ηλθον ειϲ την πολιν και ευρον καθωϲ ειπεν αυτοιϲ · και ητοιμαϲαν το πα ·

**English Translation**
And the disciples went out and came into the city and found just as he said to them; and they prepared the Passover.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is a perfect correspondence between the word of the Lord and the reality found in the city. "Just as he said" is the measure of truth; nothing was missing or different. The preparation of the Passover is the act of obedience that bridges the prophecy of the room with the event of the meal.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και οψιαϲ γενο γενομενηϲ ερχεται μετα των δωδεκα

**English Translation**
And evening [having become having become], he comes with the twelve.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The doubling of "having become" emphasizes the definitive arrival of the appointed hour. As the light fades and the evening settles, he enters the scene of the mystery. He does not come alone but "with the twelve," gathering the full number of the chosen witnesses into the darkness of the night for the revelation to come.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και ανακειμεν ανακειμεν αυτων και εϲθιον ο ειπεν αμην λεγω ϋμ οτι ειϲ εξ υμων παραδωϲει με ο εϲθιων μετ εμου ·

**English Translation**
And [while they were reclining reclining] and eating, Jesus said: Amen I say to you that one of you will betray me, the one eating with me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The posture of rest, indicated by the repeated "reclining," stands in sharp contrast to the disturbance of the announcement. The betrayal is identified not by name but by action: "the one eating with me." This participation in the same table makes the treachery a violation of the deepest bond of fellowship. The "Amen" seals the certainty of this painful truth.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ηρξαντο λυπιϲθαι και λεγιν αυτω ειϲ κατα ειϲ μητι ε

**English Translation**
They began to be grieved and to say to him one by one: Is it I?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Grief immediately seizes the disciples upon hearing the prophecy of betrayal. The question "Is it I?" exposes the frailty of the human heart; no one is so confident in his own righteousness that he does not fear himself to be the traitor. They address him individually, "one by one," placing their conscience before his judgment.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυ ειϲ των δω · ο εμβαπτο μετ εμου ειϲ το τρυβλιον ˙

**English Translation**
But he said to them: One of the twelve, the one dipping with me into the bowl.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The limiting of the accursed one to "one of the twelve" narrows the circle of tragedy. The specific action of "dipping with me into the bowl" signifies the intimacy of the shared portion. The hand that feeds with the Lord is the hand that strikes against him. This physical proximity in the dish heightens the spiritual distance of the heart.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ο ο μεν του αν ϋπαγι κα γεγραπται πε αυτου · ουαι δε τω α εκινω · δι ου ο του ανθρωπου παραδιδοται · καλ ην αυτω ει ουκ ε ο ανθρω εκεινοϲ

**English Translation**
The Son of Man indeed goes just as it has been written concerning him; but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed; good it were for him if that man had not been born.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The path of the Son of Man is governed by what "has been written," fulfilling the divine necessity. Yet, this necessity does not absolve the instrument of evil; the "woe" falls heavily upon "that man." The existence of the betrayer becomes a curse to himself, such that non-existence—never having been born—is declared preferable to the guilt he bears.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και εϲθιοντων αυτ λαβων ο ο αρτον εκλαϲεν ευλογηϲαϲ και εδωκεν αυτοιϲ και ειπεν λαβετε τουτο εϲτιν το ϲω μου ·

**English Translation**
And while they were eating, taking [the the] bread, he broke it having blessed, and gave to them and said: Take; this is my body.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the midst of the meal, he institutes a new reality. He takes the bread, blesses, breaks, and gives. The declaration "this is my body" is absolute, identifying the gift with the giver. The command to "take" invites the disciples to receive not merely bread, but the very substance of his presence, now broken for them.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και λαβ λαβ ποτηριον ευχαρι εδωκεν αυτοιϲ και επιον εξ αυτου παντεϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having taken [taken] a cup, having given thanks, he gave to them; and they all drank from it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repeated "having taken" marks the solemnity of the action regarding the cup. Thanksgiving ("eucharist") precedes the distribution. The universality of the participation is noted: "all" drank from it, binding the twelve together in the participation of the one cup, foreshadowing the unity of those who partake in the blood.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ τουτο εϲτιν το αι μου τηϲ διαθη το εκχυννο ϋπερ πολ ·

**English Translation**
And he said to them: This is my blood of the covenant, that which is poured out on behalf of many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The blood is identified as the "blood of the covenant," establishing a new relation between God and man. It is described as actively being "poured out," a sacrificial act occurring for the sake of "many." The outpouring constitutes the seal of the covenant, offering redemption through the life given in the blood.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι ου μη πι εκ του γενημα τηϲ αμπελου · εωϲ τηϲ ημεραϲ ε οταν αυτο πινω καινον εν τη βαϲιλεια του ˙

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord places a boundary upon his earthly communion. By refusing the "fruit of the vine" henceforth, He marks the end of the old dispensation and points to the "new" wine of the Kingdom. The Kingdom belongs to "Him"—the Father—and the drinking of the new wine signifies the joy of the resurrection and the eternal feast which supersedes the shadows of the present age.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και ϋμνηϲαντεϲ εξηλθον ειϲ το ο των ελαιων ˙

**English Translation**
And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Praise precedes the passion. The "hymn" armors the soul before the trial. They go out from the city to the "Mount of Olives," moving from the place of the mystical supper to the place of the crushing, for the olive must be pressed to yield its oil, just as the Christ proceeds to his agony.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ ο οτι παντεϲ ϲκ · οτι γεγραπται πα τον ποιμενα και τα προβατα δι ·

**English Translation**
And He says to them that: All will be scandalized; because it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scandal is not an accident but a fulfillment of what "is written." The strike against the "Shepherd" is the divine instrument that disperses the flock. The unity of the sheep depends entirely upon the presence of the Shepherd; when He is struck, their natural frailty leads them to scatter, proving that their gathering was by His power, not their own.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
αλλα μετα το ε με προ ϋμαϲ ειϲ τ γαλιλαιαν

**English Translation**
But after I am raised, I will go before you into Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scattering is not the end. The promise of "being raised" contains the restoration of the flock. He says "I will go before you," resuming His role as the Shepherd who leads the sheep. Galilee, the place of first calling, becomes the place of gathering, signifying a new beginning after the dark night of the scandal.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ο δε πε εφη αυτω ˙ ει και παντεϲ ϲκ · αλλ ουκ εγω

**English Translation**
But Peter said to him: If even all will be scandalized, yet not I.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter separates himself from the corporate body ("all") through pride. He presumes a strength in himself ("yet not I") that exceeds the prophetic word. By excepting himself from the common frailty, he unwittingly prepares the way for a singular fall.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτω ο αμην λεγω ϲοι ο ϲημερον ταυ τη νυκτι πριν αλεκτορα φωνη · τριϲ με απαρ ·

**English Translation**
And He says to him: Amen I say to you, that today, in this night, before a rooster crows, three times you will deny me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord dismantles the timeless boast with crushing specificity: "today," "this night," and the humble sign of the "rooster." The denial will not be a singular slip but a threefold rejection, complete and deliberate. The foreknowledge of the Lord stands absolute against the ignorance of the disciple.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εκπε ελαλει · ε με η δεη με ϲυναπο ϲοι ου μη ϲε απαρνηϲωμε ομοιωϲ ωϲαυτωϲ δε και π π ελεγον ·

**English Translation**
But he spoke exceedingly: If I must die with you, I will not deny you. Likewise also all spoke.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The excess of speech ("spoke exceedingly") betrays the poverty of spirit. Peter pledges death before he has even faced the threat of words. This confidence is contagious; the "all" who were predicted to be scandalized now mimic the boast of the one, showing how easily the flock follows error when relying on fleshly resolve.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και ερ ειϲ χωρι · ὁυ το ονομα γεθ και λε τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου · καθιϲατε ωδε · εωϲ προϲευ ·

**English Translation**
And they come into a place, of which the name is Gethsemane; and He says to his disciples: Sit here, while I pray.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They enter Gethsemane, the specific locus of the struggle. The command to "sit" halts the disciples at the periphery. The Lord advances alone to "pray," creating a necessary distance between the Savior who intercedes and the saved who can only wait.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και παρα τον πετρ και και ϊωαννην μετ αυ και ηρξατο εκ και αδημονιν

**English Translation**
And He takes Peter and and John with him, and began to be amazed and distressed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He selects witnesses from the group, Peter and John, bringing them closer to the mystery of his agony. The text reveals the onset of His passion in the soul: He begins to be "amazed" and "distressed," showing the reality of His human nature which recoils in horror before the face of death and judgment.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ πε εϲτιν η ψυχη μου · εωϲ θα μινατε ω και γρηγορειτε ˙

**English Translation**
And He says to them: My soul is deeply grieved, unto death; remain here and watch.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord confesses the state of His soul to his servants. The grief is not partial but total, reaching the threshold of "death" itself. He commands them to "watch," inviting them to participate in wakefulness against the encroaching darkness, though they cannot share in the burden of the grief itself.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και προελθων μι επιπτεν ε τηϲ γηϲ · και προϲ ει δυνατ εϲτ εϲτ παρελθιν απ αυ η ωρα ·

**English Translation**
And going forward a little, He fell on the earth, and prayed if it is possible [that] the hour pass from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The posture of falling "on the earth" demonstrates the humiliation of the Son of God, who touches the dust from which Adam was made. He prays regarding the "hour"—the appointed time of suffering. He does not deny the will of the Father but explores the boundaries of "if it is possible," showing the true struggle of the will.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και ελε αββα ο πατηρʼ παντα δυνατα ϲοι παρενεγκαι το πο τουτο απ ε · αλλ ου τι εγω θελω · αλλα τι ϲυ ˙

**English Translation**
And He said: Abba the Father, all things are possible for you; remove this cup from me; but not what I will, but what you [will].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He cries "Abba," asserting sonship even in the face of wrath. He acknowledges that "all things are possible" for the Father, yet submits to the moral necessity of the cross. The "cup" is the measured portion of suffering. The final victory is found in the displacement of the "I will" by the "You [will]," perfecting human obedience.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και ερχεται και ευ αυτουϲ κα · και λε τω πετρω ϲι καθευδιϲ · ου ϊϲχυϲαϲ μιαν ωραν γρηγορηϲαι

**English Translation**
And he comes and finds them sleeping; and he says to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? Hadst thou not strength to watch one hour?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the piercing specificities of the Lord’s address. He approaches the collective "them" who are sleeping, yet the word of rebuke narrows solely to "Peter." He calls him "Simon," reverting to the name of the natural man rather than the spiritual rock, for in sleep the apostle has shed his vigilance. The interrogation exposes the frailty of human resolve; the one who promised to die with him does not possess the strength to remain awake for a single hour.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
γρηγορειτε και προ ϊνα μη ελθηται ειϲελθηται ειϲ πιρα · το μεν προθυμον η δε ϲαρξ αϲθενηϲ ·

**English Translation**
Watch and pray, that ye come not, enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is eager, but the flesh weak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text preserves a doubled urgency in the command "come not, enter not," emphasizing the distinct layers of falling: first the approach towards the hazard, and then the entrance into the depth of the trial. The duality of human nature is laid bare; the spirit possesses a readiness that the flesh cannot sustain. Prayer and wakefulness are the prescribed bridges over the chasm between the eager will and the infirm body.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και πα απελθων προ τον αυτ λογον ειπων ·

**English Translation**
And again having gone away he prayed, saying the same word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no innovation in his plea, only persistence. He returns to the solitude of the Father, and the text notes he speaks "the same word." We learn here that intensity in supplication does not require a multiplicity of new phrases, but the profound repetition of the heart's single, consuming burden.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και παλιν ελθων ευ αυτουϲ καθευ · ηϲαν γαρ αυτων οι οφθαλ καταβεβαρη καταβαρυνομενοι και ουκ η τι αποκρι αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And again coming he found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down, weighed down, and they knew not what to answer him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred text doubles the description of their burden—"weighed down, weighed down"—signifying an oppression of drowsiness that is total and insurmountable by natural means. Their silence is the necessary fruit of their slumber; having failed to watch, they are stripped of speech. There is no defense (apologia) available to the servant who is found unconscious when the Master arrives.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και ερχεται το τριτον και λεγει αυτοιϲ καθευδετε το λοι και αναπαυ · απεχει · ηλθ ηλθ η ωρα ˙ ϊδου παρα ο του αν ειϲ ταϲ χι των αμαρτωλ αμαρτωλ ·

**English Translation**
And he comes the third time and says to them, Sleep the remaining time and rest; it is enough; the hour came, came; behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners, sinners.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition in the divine pronouncement—"the hour came, came" and the destination "sinners, sinners"—signals the irrevocable arrival of the passion. The command to sleep is no longer a test but a concession to the end of the opportunity for watching; the vigil is finished. The surrender is absolute: the Son of Man passes from the silence of prayer into the chaotic grasp of the duplicated "sinners."

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
εγειρεϲθε αγωμ · ϊδου ο παραδιδουϲ με ηγγιϲεν :

**English Translation**
Arise, let us go; behold, he that betrayeth me hath drawn near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Sleep must end not because the disciples have found strength, but because the betrayer has closed the distance. The command "let us go" is not a call to flight but to confrontation. He advances to meet the one drawing near, transforming the inevitability of capture into a voluntary act of meeting his hour.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ ετι αυτου λαλουντοϲ παρα ϊουδαϲ ειϲ των δωδεκα · και μετ αυτου οχλοϲ μετα μαχαιρων και ξυλων παρα των αρχϊερεων και των γραμμα και των πρεϲβυ

**English Translation**
And immediately, while he was yet speaking, arrives Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The identification "one of the twelve" stands as a perpetual scar upon the apostolate, marking that intimacy does not guarantee fidelity. The spiritual hierarchy—priests, scribes, elders—has allied itself with the instruments of worldly violence, "swords and staves." It is a union of religious authority and brute force arrayed against the Word.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
δεδωκει δε ο παραδιδουϲ αυ ϲυνϲημον αυτοιϲ λεγων · ον αν φιληϲω αυτοϲ εϲτιν κρατηϲατε αυ και απαγετε αϲφαλωϲ

**English Translation**
Now he that betrayed him had given a signal to them, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; seize him and lead him away safely.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The traitor employs a token of peace, the kiss, as the mechanism of war. The instruction to lead him "safely" betrays a hidden dread within the plot; even in the act of handing him over, the betrayer acknowledges a power in the victim that requires careful, secure handling lest he slip from their grasp.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
και ελ ευθυϲ και προϲελθων αυτω λεγει ραββει · και κα αυτον

**English Translation**
And coming immediately and approaching him, he says, Rabbi; and kissed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The swiftness of the approach leaves no space for hesitation. He retains the honorific title "Rabbi" upon his lips while his actions dismantle the discipleship it implies. The kiss is executed, binding the physical act of greeting to the spiritual act of treason.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
οι δε επεβαλαν ταϲ χιραϲ αυτων αυτω και εκρατηϲαν αυ

**English Translation**
And they laid their hands on him and seized him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The violence becomes tactile. Those hands, authorized by the priests and elders, touch the body of the Holy One. This seizure marks the transition from the agony of the soul in the garden to the agony of the body in the hands of men.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
ειϲ δε των παρεϲτηκοτων ϲπαϲαμενοϲ τ τ μαχαιραν και ε τον δουλ του αρχϊερεωϲ και αφιλεν αυτου το ωταριον

**English Translation**
But a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the, the sword and smote the servant of the high priest, and took off his ear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The confusion of the moment is mirrored in the stuttering text, "the, the sword." The weapon of the world is drawn by one standing by, yet it achieves only a mutilation of the "servant," not a defense of the Master. The loss of the "ear" signifies the closing of hearing; violence renders the servant deaf to the Word which stands before him.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο ειπεν αυτοιϲ ωϲ επι ληϲτην ε μετα μα και ξυλων ϲυλλαβιν με ·

**English Translation**
And answering he said to them, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to take me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He interrogates their method to expose their error. They approach him as a "robber," a violent insurrectionist who must be subdued by force ("swords and staves"). By questioning their weapons, he reveals that his kingdom and his power operate on a plane they have failed to comprehend; they bring iron to capture Truth.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
καθ η ημην προ υμαϲ εν τω ϊερω διδαϲκων και ου εκρατηϲαται με · αλλ ινα πληρωθω αι γραφαι ˙

**English Translation**
Day by day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me; but [this is] that the scriptures might be fulfilled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The speaker contrasts the openness of His teaching with the surreptitious nature of the arrest. By acting in darkness rather than seizing Him during the day in the temple, the captors reveal their own fear of the multitude. Yet, this delay and this specific moment of capture are not accidents of human cowardice but necessities of divine ordinance, ensuring that the scriptures find their completion in the events at hand.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
και α αυτον ε παντεϲ

**English Translation**
And leaving him, all fled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text presents a stark dissolution of the community that surrounded Him. The word "all" emphasizes the totality of the abandonment; not a single one remains to stand with Him. The flight is immediate and universal, leaving Him in solitary possession of the trial to come, fulfilling the isolation required by the passion.

**Verse 51**
**Greek Text**
και νεανιϲκοϲ τιϲ . ϲυνηκολουθει αυ περιβεβλημε ϲινδονα επι γυμνου · και κρατου αυτον :

**English Translation**
And a certain young man was following him, having clothed [himself] with a linen cloth upon [his] naked [body]; and they seize him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the "all" have fled, one young man attempts to follow, yet his preparation is insufficient. He is covered only by a linen cloth over nakedness, symbolizing a discipleship that lacks the armor of deep conviction. When the authorities seize him, they grasp only the outer covering, exposing the vulnerability of those who follow without counting the cost.

**Verse 52**
**Greek Text**
ο δε καταλιπων τ τ ϲινδονα γυμνοϲ εφυγεν ·

**English Translation**
But he, leaving behind the linen cloth, fled naked.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear overrides dignity. The young man surrenders his covering to the grasp of the captors rather than submit to capture himself. He escapes, but in doing so, he is stripped bare, entering the night in shame. The linen cloth remains as a mute testimony to the terror that has scattered the followers.

**Verse 53**
**Greek Text**
και απη τον προϲ τον αρχϊερεα · και ϲυνερχονται π οι αρχϊεριϲ και οι πρεϲβυτεροι κ(αι) οι γραμματειϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And they led him away to the high priest; and all the high priests and the elders and the scribes come together.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prisoner is transferred from the chaos of the arrest to the organized hostility of the council. The gathering creates a unified front of religious authority—high priests, elders, and scribes—merging their distinct offices into a single tribunal. They assemble not to inquire after truth, but to confront the One who has been led before them.

**Verse 54**
**Greek Text**
και ο πετροϲ απο μακροθεν ηκολου αυτω εωϲ εϲω ειϲ την αυλ αυλ του αρχιερεωϲ και ην ϲυνκαθημε μετα των ϋ και θερ προϲ το φωϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And Peter followed him from afar, until inside into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers and warming [himself] at the light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter follows, yet the text notes the distance: "from afar." He penetrates the courtyard of the high priest but aligns himself physically with the officers of the opposition. By sitting with them and warming himself at their fire/light, he seeks comfort in the camp of the enemy while the One he followed faces judgment alone.

**Verse 55**
**Greek Text**
οι δε αρχϊερειϲ και > ολον το ϲυνεδρι εζητουν κατα του μαρτυριαν ειϲ το θανατωϲαι αυτον · και ουχ ευ ·

**English Translation**
Now the high priests and the whole council sought testimony against him to put him to death; and found none.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The malice of the council is evident in their order of operations: they determine the sentence—death—before they possess the evidence. The "whole council" exerts its energy to find testimony "against him," yet their collective power is baffled by the absence of valid accusation. The text underscores their impotence; they seek diligently but find nothing.

**Verse 56**
**Greek Text**
πολλοι γαρ εψευδομαρτυρο κατ αυτου και ϊϲαι ειϲαι ϊϲαι αι μαρτυριαι ουκʼ ηϲαν ˙

**English Translation**
For many bore false witness against him, and the testimonies were not equal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitude of witnesses serves only to highlight the inconsistency of error. Though "many" speak, the text notes that their testimonies are not "equal" or consistent. Falsehood, having no foundation in reality, inevitably contradicts itself, whereas the truth remains singular and silent in the person of the accused.

**Verse 57**
**Greek Text**
και τινεϲ αναϲτ εψευδομαρτυ κατ αυτου λε ·

**English Translation**
And certain ones rising up bore false witness against him, saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act of "rising up" suggests a deliberate, formal presentation of the lie. These witnesses do not merely speak; they stand to deliver a calculated assault. The text categorizes their speech as "false witness" immediately, warning the hearer that the words which follow are a fabrication designed to condemn.

**Verse 58**
**Greek Text**
οτι ειπεν οτι εγω καταλυ> τον ναον του τον χειροποι · και δια τρι ημερων αλλον α οι ·

**English Translation**
That he said, "I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days another [not made with hands] I will build."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusers distort a spiritual mystery into a threat against the physical institution. By specifying "made with hands," they anchor the charge in the destruction of the material sanctuary. They acknowledge the promise of "three days" and "another" structure, yet they fail to comprehend that the temple to be raised is the body of the One standing before them.

**Verse 59**
**Greek Text**
και ου ουτωϲ ϊϲη ην η μαρτυρια αυτ ·

**English Translation**
And not even so was their testimony equal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even when focusing on a specific charge regarding the temple, the witnesses cannot maintain a coherent narrative. The lie fractures under scrutiny. The phrase "not even so" reveals that despite the specific nature of the allegation, the inherent contradiction of false witness prevents them from establishing a valid legal claim.

**Verse 60**
**Greek Text**
και αναϲταϲ ο αρχι ειϲ μεϲον · επηρωτηϲεν τ λεγων · ουκ απο ουδεν τι ου ϲου καταμαρ

**English Translation**
And the high priest, rising up into the midst, asked him, saying: "Answerest thou nothing? What [do] these witness against thee?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Frustrated by the failure of the witnesses, the high priest abandons the judicial bench to stand in the "midst," confronting the accused directly. His question demands a break in the silence. He attempts to use the prisoner's own voice to supply the condemnation that the contradictory witnesses failed to provide.

**Verse 61**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εϲιωπα και ουκʼ απεκρινατο ουδ · παλιν ο αρχϊερευϲ επηρωτα αυτον κ(αι) λεγει αυτω ϲυ ει ο ο του ευλογητου ευλογητου

**English Translation**
But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and says to him: "Are you the [one] of the Blessed Blessed?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The silence of the accused stands against the interrogation of the high priest. The questioner repeats the title "Blessed" twice, emphasizing the supreme holiness of the origin he investigates. He demands to know if the one standing before him shares the very nature of the Blessed One, yet the accused offers no defense, maintaining a silence that speaks of authority rather than guilt.

**Verse 62**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν εγω ειμι · και οψεϲθε τον > υϊον του ανθρωπου εκ δεξιων καθη τηϲ δυναμε και ερχομενον μετα των νεφε του ουρανου ·

**English Translation**
But he said: "I am; and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right [hand] of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The declaration "I am" breaks the silence with absolute affirmation. The speaker identifies himself as the Son of Man who will occupy the position of highest authority, seated at the right of the Power. This vision joins the present moment of judgment with a future revelation, where the one now judged will come with the clouds of heaven to judge the earth.

**Verse 63**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αρχϊερευϲ διαρ τουϲ χιτω> αυτου λεγει ˙ τι ετι χρειαν εχομ μαρτυρων ·

**English Translation**
But the high priest, tearing his tunics, says: "What need do we still have of witnesses?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tearing of the tunics is a physical manifestation of the high priest's rejection of the testimony. By rending his garments, he signals that the words spoken are sufficient for condemnation without further proof. The legal requirement for witnesses is abandoned because the confession itself is perceived as the ultimate offense.

**Verse 64**
**Greek Text**
ϊδε ν ηκουϲατε τηϲ βλα · τι ϋμιν φαινεται οι δε παντεϲ κατε> αυτον ενο ειναι θανατου ·

**English Translation**
See, you heard the blasphemy; what appears to you? And they all condemned him to be liable of death.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The charge is identified explicitly as blasphemy, based solely on the hearing of the council. The question "what appears to you" invites a collective sentence. The judgment is unanimous; "all" participate in the condemnation, declaring the accused not merely guilty, but specifically liable to the penalty of death.

**Verse 65**
**Greek Text**
και ηρξαντο τινεϲ εμπτυειν αυτω · και περικαλυπτε αυτου το προϲωπ · και κολαφιζειν αυ και λεγειν αυ> προφητευϲ · και οι ϋπηρεται ρα αυτον > ελαβον ˙

**English Translation**
And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him: "Prophesy!" And the attendants took him with blows.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The condemnation turns immediately to physical degradation. They cover his face to mock his vision, demanding he "prophesy" while blinded to their strikes. The attendants receive him not with custody but with violence, as the spitting and buffeting demonstrate the total rejection of his dignity.

**Verse 66**
**Greek Text**
και οντοϲ του πε> κατω εν τη αυ · ερχεται μια παι του αρχϊερεωϲ

**English Translation**
And Peter being below in the courtyard, there comes one maidservant of the high priest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The narrative descends to where Peter remains "below" in the courtyard. This spatial separation mirrors his spiritual distance. The approach of a single maidservant of the high priest marks the beginning of a new examination, not of the master, but of the follower.

**Verse 67**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδουϲα τον πε θερμαινομε εμβλεψαϲα > αυτω λεγει · και ϲυ μετα του ηϲθα του ναζαρηνου ·

**English Translation**
And seeing Peter warming himself, looking at him, she says: "You also were with the Nazarene."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter seeks physical warmth, but his face is recognized. The maidservant looks closely and identifies his association with the "Nazarene." By using this title, she links Peter to the specific earthly origin of the one now being condemned above.

**Verse 68**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ηρνηϲατο λεγ ουτε οιδα · ουτε επι ϲυ τι λεγειϲ · και εξηλθεν εξω ειϲ το προαυλιον

**English Translation**
But he denied, saying: "Neither do I know, nor do I understand what you say." And he went out into the forecourt.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The denial is two-fold: a claim of ignorance regarding the person and a lack of understanding regarding the accusation. He attempts to remove himself from the light of the fire and the gaze of the accuser by retreating outward into the forecourt, seeking safety in distance.

**Verse 69**
**Greek Text**
και η παιδιϲκη ϊδου αυτον ηρξατο > παλιν λεγειν τοιϲ παρεϲτωϲιν · οτι > ουτοϲ εξ αυτων εϲτιν

**English Translation**
And the maidservant, seeing him, began again to say to those standing by: "This one is of them."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The escape fails as the maidservant sees him again. She broadens the accusation, speaking now to "those standing by." The charge shifts from personal proximity to group membership, identifying him as being "of them," one of the distinct group surrounding the condemned.

**Verse 70**
**Greek Text**
ο δε παλιν ηρνειτο κ(αι) μετα μεικρον > παλιν οι παρεϲτω ελεγον τω πε αληθωϲ εξ αυ ει · και γαρ γαλει ει ·

**English Translation**
But he again was denying. And after a little, again those standing by were saying to Peter: "Truly you are of them, for you are also a Galilean."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of denial is met with the persistence of the crowd. Those standing by use his identity as a "Galilean" as irrefutable proof of his connection to the group. His very nature and origin betray him, even as his words attempt to conceal the truth.

**Verse 71**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ηρξατο αναθε και ομνυ · οτι ουκ οιδα τ ανθρωπον ·

**English Translation**
But he began to curse and to swear: "I do not know the man."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciple escalates his rejection to the point of anathema. By cursing and swearing, he attempts to create an absolute barrier between himself and "the man." He refuses to even name the one he denies, reducing him to an anonymous figure.

**Verse 72**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ αλεκτωρ εφωνηϲεν και α ο πετροϲ το ρημα ωϲ ειπεν αυτω ο οτι πριν αλεκτορα φωνηϲαι τριϲ με απαρνηϲη και επιβαλων εκλαυ εκλεεν

**English Translation**
And immediately a rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word as he said to him: "That before a rooster crows, three times you will deny me." And casting [his mind] thereon, he was weeping weeping.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sound of the rooster serves as the divine signal, instantly bringing memory to Peter. The prophecy regarding the "three times" is fulfilled in the very act of denial. The text describes his reaction with intense repetition, "weeping weeping," signifying a grief that is both immediate and overwhelming as he realizes the truth of the word spoken to him.
