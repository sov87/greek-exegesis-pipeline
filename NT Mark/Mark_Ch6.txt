**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εξηλθεν εκιθ και ερχεται ειϲ τ πατριδα αυτου κ(αι) ακολουθουϲιν αυ οι μαθηται αυ

**English Translation**
And he went out from there and comes into his fatherland and his disciples follow him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The movement is distinct: he departs from one place to enter the territory of his origin. He does not go alone; the disciples follow, establishing the order of the Master leading and the learners pursuing. The return to the fatherland serves not as a retreat but as a deliberate bringing of the new authority into the sphere of old familiarity.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και γενομενου ϲαββατου ηρξατο διδαϲκειν εν τη ϲυναγωγη και πολ ακουοντεϲ εξε λεγον ποθεν τουτω ταυτα παντα και τιϲ η ϲοφια η δοθιϲα τουτω και αι δυνα τοιαυται αι τοιαυται αι δια τ χειρων αυτου γι

**English Translation**
And the Sabbath having come, he began to teach in the synagogue; and many hearing were astonished, saying: Whence to this [man] all these things? And what is the wisdom given to this [man], and such powers—such ones—which come about through his hands?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The astonishment of the multitude arises from a perceived disconnect between the man they observe and the wisdom he possesses. They confess the reality of the wisdom given and the powers wrought by his hands, emphasized by the repetition of "such ones." Yet, their interrogation "whence" reveals that while they see the work, they fail to discern the source, stumbling over the vessel rather than receiving the gift.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ουχ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο τεκτων ο τηϲ μαριαϲ και ο αδελ ϊακωβου και ϊωϲηφ και ϊουδα και ϲιμωνοϲ και ουκ ειϲιν αι αδελ αυτου ωδε προϲ ημαϲ και ε εν αυτω

**English Translation**
Is this not the carpenter, the [son] of Mary, and the brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were stumbled in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They define him by his trade and his earthly kinship, listing James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon to reduce him to the level of commonality. The presence of his sisters "with us" reinforces this proximity. Their stumble—the scandal—arises precisely because they know his human lineage but cannot reconcile it with divine authority; familiarity becomes the block over which their faith falls.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ ο οτι ουκ εϲτιν προφητηϲ ατιμοϲ ει μη εν τη πατρι εαυτου ϊδια πατριδι αυτου και εν τοιϲ ϲυνγενεϲιν κ(αι) τη οικια αυτου

**English Translation**
And Jesus said to them that a prophet is not without honor except in his fatherland—his own fatherland—and among the kinsmen and in his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text asserts a rule of rejection: the prophet finds honor everywhere but in the place of his origin. The emphatic repetition of "fatherland" alongside "kinsmen" and "house" narrows the circle of dishonor to the most intimate spheres. Those nearest in flesh are furthest in spirit, blindness being the penalty of presumed knowledge.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ ηδυνατο εκει ποιηϲαι ου δυναμ ει μη ολιγοιϲ αρ επιθειϲ ταϲ χιραϲ εθεραπευ

**English Translation**
And he was not able to do any power there, except that he healed a few infirm [people] by laying on [his] hands.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The lack of power is not a defect in the Lord but a consequence of the people's reception. The text states he was not able, linking the operation of miracles to the presence of faith. Yet mercy persists even in rejection, as he lays hands on the few infirm who present themselves, distinguishing the receptive few from the unbelieving many.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και εθαυμαϲ δια την απιϲτι αυτων και περι ο ταϲ κω κυκλω διδα

**English Translation**
And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went about the villages in a circuit teaching.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord marvels at the hardness of their hearts, marking their unbelief as something contrary to nature and reason. This rejection does not cease his work but displaces it; he moves into the surrounding circuit of villages. The teaching continues, flowing around the obstacle of the fatherland to water the adjacent lands.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλειται τουϲ · · και ηρξα αυτουϲ αποϲτελ δυο δυο ˙ και ε εδιδου αυτοιϲ εξουϲιαν των πνευματων των ακαθαρτων εξουϲιαν των πνευματων τ ακαθαρτων

**English Translation**
And he calls the [Twelve]; and he began to send them two [by] two; and he gave to them authority over the unclean spirits—authority over the unclean spirits.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He initiates the mission by calling and sending them in pairs, ensuring that every testimony is established by two witnesses. The repetition of the grant of authority over unclean spirits underscores the absolute nature of this power. The disciple is transformed into an apostle through this delegation, carrying the master's power against the forces of impurity.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) παρηγγειλεν αυτοιϲ κ(αι) παρηγʼγειλεν αυτοιϲ ϊνα μηδεν αρωϲιν ειϲ οδον ει μη ραβδον μονον μη αρτον μη πηραν μη ειϲ την ζωνην χαλκ χαλκ

**English Translation**
And he charged them—and he charged them—that they should take nothing for the way except a staff only; no bread, no wallet, no copper—copper—in the belt.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double charge emphasizes the severity of the command. The apostle must rely wholly on the sender, taking only a staff for support. The prohibition against bread, wallet, and the repeated "copper" strips away all material security. They are to walk in dependence, possessing nothing so that they may offer everything.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
αλλα ϋποδεδεμε ϲανδαλια και μη ενδυϲηϲ δυο χιτωναϲ

**English Translation**
But being shod with sandals; and do not put on two tunics.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Preparation for the journey requires sandals for the feet, enabling movement. However, the prohibition against a second tunic forbids excess and comfort. The messenger is equipped for travel but stripped of luxury, presenting a singular appearance that matches the singular focus of their mission.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ οπου εαν ειϲελ ειϲ οικιαν εκει μινατε εωϲ αν εξελθητε εκι

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Wherever you enter into a house, remain there until you go out from there.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He commands stability within the mission. By remaining in the first house entered, the messenger avoids the appearance of seeking better provision or status. They must abide where they are received, making the house a temporary station of the kingdom until their departure from that locale.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και οϲʼ αν τοποϲ μη δεξηται ϋμαϲ μηδε ακουϲωϲιν ϋμων εκπορευο εκειθεν εκτιναξατε τον χουν τον ϋποκα των ποδων ϋμων ειϲ μαρτυ αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And whatever place does not receive you nor hear you, going out from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Rejection triggers a prophetic sign. If a place refuses the messengers, they must leave, taking nothing with them, not even the dust. This act separates the holy laborers from the rebellious soil, standing as a visible testimony against the inhabitants that the kingdom drew near and was repelled.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθοντεϲ εκηρυξαν αυτοιϲ ϊνα μετανοηϲωϲ

**English Translation**
And having gone out, they preached to them that they should repent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The execution of the command is immediate: they go out. The substance of their preaching is repentance, calling for a fundamental change of mind. The authority over spirits and the stripping of wealth serve this singular end: to compel the hearers to turn from their ways.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και δαιμονια πολ εξεβαλλον κ(αι) ηλειφον ελαιω πολλουϲ αρρωϲτουϲ και εθεραπευον

**English Translation**
And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many sick people and healed them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The expulsion of demons precedes the restoration of the flesh, for the spirit must be cleansed before the body finds true rest. The apostles employ oil not as mere medicine, but as a seal of divine mercy, touching the sick to convey power. This act of healing confirms the authority granted to them, manifesting the kingdom through visible signs upon the suffering many.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και ηκουϲεν ο βαϲιλευϲ ηρωδηϲ φανερον γαρ εγενε το ονομα αυτου και ελεγεν οτι ϊω ο βαπτιζ εγηγερται εκ νεκρ και δια τουτο ενερ αι δυναμιϲ εν αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And King Herod heard, for his name became manifest, and he said that John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this the powers operate in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The name of the Lord becomes manifest, penetrating even the courts of power and forcing recognition from the unrighteous. King Herod, struck by the miraculous works, confesses a resurrection, though he mistakes the person. He acknowledges that power operates through one raised from the dead, admitting that the grave cannot bind the source of such mighty acts.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
αλλοι δε ελεγον οτι ηλιαϲ εϲτιν αλλοι δε οτι προ ωϲ ειϲ τ προφητων

**English Translation**
But others said that it is Elias; but others that he is a prophet as one of the prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowds struggle to categorize the divine presence, grasping at ancient figures like Elias to explain the new authority. They perceive the continuity of the spirit, identifying him as a prophet equal to those of old. This confusion reveals that while they see the prophetic office, they have not yet discerned the unique Sonship.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ο ηρω ελεγεν ον ε απεκεφαλιϲα ουτοϲ ϊωαννηϲ ουτοϲ ϊωαννηϲ αυτοϲ ϊωαννην ουτοϲ ηγερθη

**English Translation**
But Herod having heard said, "The one I beheaded, this John, this John, he John, this one was raised."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herod claims ownership of the violence, admitting he beheaded John. His stammering repetition of the name John betrays a haunted mind, fixated on the man he destroyed. He concludes with certainty that this very one has been raised, his guilt testifying to the reality of life after death.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ γαρ ο ο γαρ αυτοϲ γαρ ο ηρωδηϲ αποϲτι εκρατηϲε τον ϊωαννην και εδη αυτον εν φυ δια ηρωδι την γυναικα φιλιππου του αδελ αυτου οτι αυτ εγαμηϲεν

**English Translation**
For he, for the, for he Herod, having sent, seized John and bound him in prison because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he married her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The narrative turns to the cause of the imprisonment, rooting it in the unlawful desire for Herodias. Herod binds the messenger of truth to silence the conviction of his own sin. The seizure of John is the direct result of the king marrying the wife of his brother Philip, showing how lust leads to persecution.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ελεγεν γαρ ὁ ϊω τω ηρωδη ο ουκ εξεϲτιν ϲοι εχ εχ την γυναικα του αδελφου ϲου

**English Translation**
For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have, to have the wife of your brother."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John speaks the divine prohibition directly to power, declaring the union unlawful. He defends the sanctity of the brother's house against the king's encroachment. The repetition of "to have" underscores the persistence of the sin and the prophet's unyielding demand for righteousness.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
η δε ηρωδιαϲ ενει αυτω και ηθε αυτον αποκτι και ουκ ηδυνα

**English Translation**
But Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him, and was not able.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herodias harbors the grudge, her internal malice seeking the death of the accuser. Her desire for murder is checked only by lack of opportunity, showing that the intent to destroy truth exists even when power is momentarily restrained. She stands as the adversary to the prophet, consuming herself with a hatred she cannot yet satisfy.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ο γαρ ηρωδηϲ ε τον ϊω ειδωϲ αυ ανδρα δικαι και αγιον και ϲυνε αυτον · και α αυτου πολ ηπορει · και η αυτου ηκου

**English Translation**
For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a man righteous and holy, and he kept him safe; and having heard him he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herod is torn between his vice and his recognition of holiness. He fears the prisoner, acknowledging John as righteous and holy, and paradoxically acts as his protector. The king is much perplexed by the words he hears, yet finds a strange sweetness in listening, revealing a soul disturbed by truth yet unwilling to submit to it.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και γενομενηϲ η ευκαιρου οτε ηρωδηϲ τοιϲ γενεϲιοιϲ αυτου διπνον εποιηϲ τοιϲ μεγιϲταϲιν αυτου και τοιϲ χι και τοιϲ πρωτοιϲ τηϲ γαλι

**English Translation**
And a festive day having come, when Herod on his birthday made a supper for his great men and the chiliarchs and the first men of Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The opportune day arrives not for grace, but for indulgence. Herod gathers the powers of the world—his great men, military commanders, and the chiefs of Galilee—to celebrate his own birth. This assembly of earthly authority sets the stage where the voice of God will be silenced to please the pride of men.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ελθουϲηϲ ειϲελθουϲηϲ τηϲ θυγατροϲ αυτου η και ορ ηρε τω ηρωδη κ(αι) τοιϲ ϲυνανακειμε ὁ δε βαϲιλευϲ ειπ τω κοραϲιω αιτη με ο εαν θεληϲ και δωϲω ϲοι

**English Translation**
And his daughter H... having come in and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. And the king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text identifies the dancer as his own daughter, who enters to entertain the feast. Her dancing pleases both the king and his guests, binding them in a shared moment of sensory delight. In his rapture, the king abdicates his prudence, offering the girl power over his kingdom's resources based on a fleeting pleasure.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και ωμοϲεν αυτη ο ο εαν αιτηϲηϲ δωϲω ϲοι εωϲ η τηϲ βαϲι μου

**English Translation**
And he swore to her, "Whatever you ask, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He binds himself with an oath, staking his sovereignty on the whim of a child. By offering up to half his kingdom, he shows that he values the applause of the banquet more than the stability of his rule. This reckless vow creates the trap from which he cannot escape without losing face before men.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθουϲα ειπ ειπ τη μητρι αυτηϲ τι αιτηϲωμαι η δε ει την κεφαλ ϊωαννου του βα

**English Translation**
And having gone out she said to her mother, "What should I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the Baptizer."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The girl seeks counsel from her mother, lacking her own malice but willing to adopt another's. The mother wastes no time in demanding the head of John the Baptizer, prioritizing vengeance over any material wealth. Thus, the prophet's life is traded for a dance, as the mother directs the sword of the state against the voice of God.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και ελθουϲα ειϲελθουϲα ευθυϲ μετα ϲπουδηϲ προϲ τον βαϲιλεα ητη λεγουϲα θελω ϊνα εξαυτηϲ δωϲ μοι επι πινακι τ κεφαλην ϊωαννου του βαπτιϲτου

**English Translation**
And coming in, entering immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying, "I will that instantly you give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrifying speed of wickedness; the damsel enters not with hesitation but with haste and immediate resolve. She does not merely request but asserts her will, demanding that the head of the prophet be served as a course in the banquet. The hunger of iniquity is such that it desires to consume the righteous instantly, placing the holy relic upon a platter intended for common meat, thereby desecrating the sacred vessel of the Baptist's life.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και περιλυποϲ γενο ο βαϲιλευϲ δια τουϲ ορκουϲ κ(αι) τουϲ ϲυνανακειμε ουκ ηθελη αθετηϲαι αυ

**English Translation**
And becoming very grieved, the king, on account of the oaths and those reclining with him, did not wish to set her aside.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The king is ensnared by his own foolish tongue and the fear of men; he grieves not for the sin itself but for the trap in which he finds himself. He honors the oaths made before those reclining at the table more than the law of God, preferring to violate justice rather than lose face before his guests. Thus, human respect becomes the chain that drags the soul into the commission of murder, proving that a weak will is easily mastered by the presence of the crowd.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ αποϲτι ο βαϲιλευϲ ϲπε ϲπεκλατορα ϲπεκουλατορα επετα ενεγκε την κεφαλην αυτου

**English Translation**
And immediately the king, sending a guardsman—a speculator—commanded to bring his head.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no delay between the wicked resolve and the bloody act; the king sends the executioner immediately, silencing the voice that called him to repentance. The guard is dispatched not to defend the kingdom but to assault holiness, bringing the head of the just man as if it were a tribute. Power, when divorced from wisdom, becomes a swift instrument of death, treating the life of a prophet as a mere object to be fetched at a command.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
επι πινακι και ε αυτην τω κοραϲιω και το κοραϲιον εδω αυτην τη μη αυτηϲ :

**English Translation**
on a platter, and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the hierarchy of sin: the king gives the grisly prize to the damsel, and the damsel passes it to her mother, completing the circle of malice. The platter, meant for sustenance, now bears the weight of martyrdom, passed from hand to hand as a gift. In this grim exchange, we see how the instruction of the wicked parent bears fruit in the child, who becomes the carrier of death to satisfy the mother's grudge.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και ϲ̣κουϲαντεϲ ακουϲαντεϲ οι μαθηται αυτου ηλθον και ηραν το πτωμα αυτου και εθηκαν αυτ εν μνημιω

**English Translation**
And hearing, his disciples came and took up his corpse and placed it in a tomb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the palace revels in blood, the faithful disciples perform the duties of piety and sorrow. They do not fight the king but honor the remains of their teacher, removing the corpse from the scene of mockery to the silence of the tomb. Even in death, the prophet gathers followers who serve him with reverence, contrasting the noise of the banquet with the solemnity of the burial, where the body that preached repentance is laid to rest.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυναγονται οι α προϲ τον και απηγ αυτω παν οϲα εποιηϲαν και κ(αι) οϲα εδιδαξαν

**English Translation**
And the apostles gather together unto the [One], and reported to him all things, as many as they did and as many as they taught.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scattered laborers return to the source of their authority to give an account of their stewardship. They report both deeds and doctrine—what they did and what they taught—showing that action and instruction must remain united in the apostolic ministry. They gather unto Him, for the worker is not independent but must constantly return to the Master to calibrate his work and offer the fruits of his labor.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ δευ ϋμιϲ αυτοι κα ϊδιαν ειϲ επ ερημ τοπον και αναπαυ ολιγον ηϲαν γαρ οι ερχο και οι ϋπα πολλοι και ουδε φαγειν ευκαιρουν

**English Translation**
And he says to them, "Come you yourselves privately into a desert place and rest a little." For those coming and those going were many, and they had no opportunity even to eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord recognizes the frailty of the flesh and the necessity of withdrawal from the tumult of the world. The constant coming and going of the many deprives the soul of peace and the body of nourishment, so He commands a retreat to the desert place. Rest is not a cessation of holiness but a preparation for it, granted by the Master who knows that his servants require a respite from the pressing crowds to sustain their ministry.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και απηλθον εν πλοιω ειϲ ερημ τοπον κατ ϊδιαν

**English Translation**
And they went away in the boat to a desert place privately.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Obedience is immediate as they utilize the boat to separate themselves from the land-bound multitude. They seek the desert place not for barrenness but for the presence of God in solitude, distinct from the noise of the cities. The boat serves as the vessel of transition, carrying the weary from the place of labor to the place of refreshment, guided by the will of Him who called them aside.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδον αυτουϲ ϋπαγονταϲ και ε αυτουϲ πολλοι και πεζη απο πα των πολε ϲυνεδραμ εκει και προηλθ αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And they saw them going, and many knew them, and on foot from all the cities they ran together there and preceded them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The thirst of the people for the Word cannot be quenched by distance; recognizing the departure, they run on foot to outpace the vessel. The zeal of the multitude from all the cities overcomes the physical obstacle of the journey, demonstrating that when the soul truly perceives the source of life, it will endure any exertion to be near it. They arrive before the boat, turning the intended solitude into a new congregation.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθων ειδ οχλον πολυν κ(αι) εϲπλαγχνιϲθη επ αυτουϲ οτι ηϲ ωϲ προβατα μη εχοντα ποι και ηρξατο διδαϲκιν αυτουϲ πολλα

**English Translation**
And coming out he saw a great crowd and was moved with compassion upon them, because they were as sheep having no shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord does not resent the intrusion upon his rest but responds with divine compassion, seeing the spiritual destitution of the crowd. He identifies them as sheep without a shepherd, wandering and defenseless, and his remedy for their chaotic state is doctrine. He begins to teach them many things, for the primary food of the shepherdless soul is the truth of God, which gathers the scattered and guides the lost.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και ηδη ωραϲ πολ γινομενηϲ προϲελθοντεϲ αυτω οι μαθηται αυτου αυτου ελε οτι ερημοϲ ε ο τοποϲ και ηδη ωρα πολλη

**English Translation**
And already a late hour coming to be, his disciples coming to him said that "The place is desert, and already the hour is late;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples look with eyes of flesh, seeing only the barrenness of the desert and the passing of time. They are anxious about the late hour and the lack of resources, measuring the situation by earthly constraints rather than divine provision. They interrupt the teaching to point out the obvious difficulty, failing to understand that the presence of the Word transforms the desert into a place of plenty.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
απολυϲον αυτουϲ ϊνα απελθοντεϲ ειϲ τουϲ κυκλω α και κωμαϲ αγοραϲωϲιν εαυ βρωματα τι φαγωϲιν

**English Translation**
dismiss them, that going away into the surrounding fields and villages they might buy for themselves foods, something to eat."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The counsel of the disciples is to scatter the flock back into the world to fend for themselves. They suggest dismissal and commerce—"buy for themselves"—as the solution to hunger, trusting in the surrounding villages more than in the Shepherd who stands before them. It is the instinct of man to solve problems by sending the needy away, whereas the instinct of God is to draw them near and feed them from his own hand.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει αυτοιϲ δοτε αυ ϋμειϲ φαγιν · και λεγουϲιν αυτω απελθοντεϲ αγο δηνα διακοϲιων αρτουϲ και δωϲω αυτοιϲ φαγε ·

**English Translation**
But he answering said to them, Give them you yourselves to eat. And they say to him, Having gone away, shall we buy loaves of two hundred denarii, and shall we give them to eat?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "Give them you yourselves to eat" places the burden of charity upon the disciples, exposing the insufficiency of their own resources. By calculating the cost at "two hundred denarii," the disciples retreat to the logic of the market and the limits of human economy. They see only the impossibility of the purchase, failing to perceive the Creator who stands before them, who requires not coin but obedience to feed the multitude.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
ο δε λεγει αυτοιϲ ποϲουϲ αρτουϲ ε ϋπαγετε ϊδετε και ελθοντεϲ γνοντεϲ λεγου πεντε · και δυο

**English Translation**
But he says to them, How many loaves have you? Go, see. And having come, knowing, they say, Five, and two.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord compels them to inspect their own poverty with the command "Go, see." Before the miracle can occur, the precise extent of the lack—"five and two"—must be confessed. This knowledge creates the vessel for divine filling; we must first measure our scarcity and admit we possess only a few earthly elements before they can be transfigured into spiritual abundance.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και επεταξεν αυ ανακλιθη πανταϲ ϲυμ ϲυμποϲια επι τω χλωρω χορ

**English Translation**
And he commanded them that all should recline, symposia by symposia, upon the green grass.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Order is imposed upon the chaos of the crowd through the arrangement of "symposia by symposia." The setting upon "green grass" evokes the Shepherd's provision, recalling the psalmist's testimony of being made to lie down in green pastures. The act of reclining signifies that this is not a hurried ration for survival, but a structured feast of peace amidst the wilderness.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και ανεπεϲ πραϲιαι κατα εκατ και κατα

**English Translation**
And they fell back in garden plots, by hundreds and by...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The faithful differ from a mob by their structure; here they are arranged like "garden plots," cultivated and distinct. The grouping by "hundreds" reflects a hierarchy and a discipline within the body, ensuring that the distribution of grace is orderly and that no soul is overlooked in the confusion of the mass.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και λαβων τουϲ π αρτουϲ και τουϲ δυο ϊχθυαϲ ανα ειϲ τον ου ευλογηϲ και κλαϲαϲ τουϲ αρτουϲ κ(αι) εδιδου τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ ϊνα πα παραθωϲιν αυτοιϲ και τουϲ · · ϊχθυαϲ ε παϲιν

**English Translation**
And having taken the five loaves and the two fish, looking up to the heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves and gave to the disciples that they might set before them; and the two fish he divided among all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He looks "up to the heaven" to demonstrate the unity of operation between the Son and the Father, acknowledging the source of all gifts. The action follows a divine liturgy: taking, looking, blessing, breaking, and giving. The food is not given directly to the crowd but through the hands of the disciples, establishing the priestly office of mediation where the ministers distribute what they have received from the Lord.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) εφαγον παντεϲ και εχορταϲθηϲ

**English Translation**
And they all ate and were satisfied.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The result of divine feeding is total satisfaction; they "all ate" and were "satisfied." The bread of the earth merely sustains, but the bread blessed by the Word fulfills the appetite completely. There is no partiality in this feast, for the sufficiency of God covers the entire multitude without exception.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και ηραν κλαϲμα · · κοφινων πληρωματα και απο των δυο ϊχθυ

**English Translation**
And they took up of fragments full measures of baskets, and from the two fish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "full measures" of fragments gathered exceed the original supply, proving that the gift increases in the spending. That which is broken for God does not diminish but multiplies. The gathering of the remnants teaches that no grace is to be wasted, and the surplus remains as a testimony to the inexhaustible nature of the divine power.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
και ηϲαν οι φαγοντεϲ το ωϲ πεν ανδρεϲ :

**English Translation**
And those having eaten [the loaves] were about five [thousand] men.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The specific numbering of the men serves to anchor the miracle in history, preventing it from being dismissed as a parable or illusion. The count testifies to the magnitude of the authority exercised, showing that the power of the Word is capable of sustaining a legion as easily as a single household.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ ηναγκα τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου εμβηναι ειϲ πλοιον και προα ειϲ το περ προϲ βηθϲαϊδαν . εωϲ αυτοϲ απολυ τον οχλον

**English Translation**
And immediately he compelled his disciples to step into a boat and to go before to the other side toward Bethsaida, while he dismisses the crowd.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He "compelled" the disciples, severing them from the crowd to prevent them from being swept up in earthly acclaim. By sending them "to the other side" while he remains, he trains them in obedience and prepares them to navigate the waters without his visible presence. His dismissal of the crowd shows his personal care, ensuring the flock is dispersed in peace before he attends to the Father.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
και αποταξαμενοϲ αυτοιϲ απηλθεν ειϲ το οροϲ προϲευ

**English Translation**
And having taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
After the public work of ministry, he seeks the solitude of the "mountain." This ascent signifies the elevation of the mind required for pure prayer. The Lord demonstrates that action must be sustained by contemplation; he withdraws from men to commune with the Father, teaching us that the source of power lies not in the applause of the multitude but in the silence of the heights.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
και οψιαϲ γενομε ην το πλοιον εν μεϲω τηϲ θα και αυτοϲ μονοϲ επι τηϲ γηϲ ·

**English Translation**
And evening having come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A stark contrast is drawn between the "midst of the sea," a place of turmoil and instability for the church-vessel, and the firm "land" where the Lord stands. His being "alone" underscores his divine otherness and sovereignty. He is separated from them in body, yet his gaze encompasses their struggle, watching the vessel from the shore of eternity.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδων αυτουϲ βαϲανιζομενουϲ εν τω ελαυνιν γαρ εναντιοϲ ο α αυτοιϲ περι τεταρτην φυ τηϲ νυκτοϲ ερχεται προϲ αυτουϲ περιπατων επι τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ και ηθελεν παρελθε αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And seeing them tormented in the driving [rowing], for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking upon the sea, and he wished to pass by them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He waits until the "fourth watch," allowing the disciples to struggle against the "contrary" wind to test their endurance and expose their need. His "walking upon the sea" reveals his dominion over the chaotic abyss. That he "wished to pass by them" is not indifference, but a manifestation of divine glory, mirroring God passing before the prophets, inciting them to cry out for his saving presence.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ϊδοντεϲ αυ επι τηϲ θαλαϲ περιπατουν εδοξαν οτι φ εϲτιν · και ανεκραξαν

**English Translation**
But they, seeing him walking on the sea, thought that it is a ghost; and they cried out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples perceive the form but fail to discern the substance. Seeing him walking upon the unstable waters, their minds suggest a phantom (*phantasma*) rather than the Master of creation. The cry which bursts forth is one of terror, for the carnal eye, when confronted with divine dominion over the elements, retreats into superstition. They mistake the Lord of life for an apparition of death.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
παν γαρ αυτον ειδαν και εταραχθηϲαν . ο δε ευθυϲ ελαληϲ μετ αυτων και λεγει αυτοιϲ θαρϲειτε ε ειμι μη φοβει

**English Translation**
For all saw him and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them and says to them, Be of good courage, it is I, do not fear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vision was common to all, ensuring that this was no solitary hallucination, yet the trouble was also universal. The remedy for this collective disturbance is the voice of the Word. He commands courage and reveals his identity with the divine pronouncement, "It is I." The prohibition against fear is grounded solely in his presence; where He is, terror cannot remain.

**Verse 51**
**Greek Text**
και ανεβη προϲ αυ ειϲ το πλοιον και εκοπαϲεν ο ανεμοϲ και λιαν εν εαυτοιϲ εξιϲτ εξιϲτ

**English Translation**
And he went up to them into the boat, and the wind ceased; and they were exceedingly amazed in themselves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He ascends into the vessel, and the creation acknowledges its Creator by sinking into silence. The cessation of the wind is immediate, yet it produces a turbulence within the souls of the men. Their amazement is excessive, revealing that they have not yet grasped the fullness of his power. The calm of the sea stands in contrast to the storm of astonishment within the human heart.

**Verse 52**
**Greek Text**
ου γαρ ϲυνηκαν επι τοιϲ αρτοιϲ αλ ην αυτων η καρ πεπωρωμενη

**English Translation**
For they understood not concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the root of their astonishment: a failure of memory and understanding. The miracle of the bread should have prepared them for the miracle of the sea, demonstrating that nature bends to his will. Because they did not spiritually digest the breaking of the loaves, their hearts remained callous (*peporomenē*). A hardened heart sees the sign but misses the significance, leaving the soul unprepared for the next revelation of glory.

**Verse 53**
**Greek Text**
και διαπεραϲαν επι την γην ηλ ειϲ γεννηϲα και προϲωρμη προϲωρμιϲθηϲαν

**English Translation**
And having crossed over to the land, they came to Gennesaret and moored.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The journey across the water finds its completion at Gennesaret. They moor the boat, signifying the end of the trial by sea and the beginning of the labor on land. The text records the specific harbor to ground the divine acts in earthly reality; the Lord does not hover above the world but anchors himself within it to minister to its inhabitants.

**Verse 54**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθ αυτων εκ του πλοιου ευθυϲ επι αυτον

**English Translation**
And as they came out of the boat, immediately upon him...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The narrative moves with haste. There is no interval between the exit from the ship and the engagement with the Lord. The text places the focus "immediately upon him," suggesting that his presence instantly draws the attention and recognition of the people. The world waits for him, and as soon as he is revealed, the multitude presses in.

**Verse 55**
**Greek Text**
περιεδραμον ολ την χωραν εκειν και ηρξαντο εν τοιϲ τοιϲ επι τοιϲ κραβακτοιϲ τουϲ κακωϲ εχον περιφερειν ο ηκουϲθη οτι εϲτιν

**English Translation**
They ran around that whole region and began to carry around on pallets those who were sick, where it was heard that he is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stillness of the moored boat gives way to the frantic running of the people. The pallet, a bed of suffering, becomes a mobile testimony of faith as they carry the sick to and fro. Their movement is dictated not by their own will but by the report of his location. The immense need of the region seeks the only source of relief, following the rumor of his presence ("that he is") with desperate hope.

**Verse 56**
**Greek Text**
και οπου εαν ειϲε ειϲ κω η ειϲ πολιϲ η ειϲ αγρουϲ η εν ταιϲ αγοραιϲ ετιθεϲαν τουϲ αϲθενουνταϲ και παρεκαλουν αυτον ϊνα καν του κραϲπεδου του ϊ αυτου αψ και οϲοι ηψαν αυτου εϲωζον

**English Translation**
And wherever he entered into villages or into cities or into fields, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and besought him that they might touch if only the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The grace of the Lord permeates every quarter—village, city, and field. The marketplaces, usually devoted to trade, are sanctified by the laying down of the weak. The faith of the people has become so tangible that they seek only the fringe of his garment, believing that contact with the hem of the Holy One suffices for wholeness. Salvation (*esozonto*) is granted to all who touch him, for power flows from his very vestments to restore the broken.
