**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και διαγενομε του ϲαββατου η δε μαρια η μαγδα και μαρια η του ϊακωβου · και ϲαλω ηγοραϲαν αρω ϊνα ελθου> αλιψωϲιν αυ :

**English Translation**
And the Sabbath having passed, but Mary the Magdalene and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought spices so that coming they might anoint him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the fidelity of these women. The scribe abbreviates their holy task—`αρω` for *aromata* (spices)—yet their intent is full. The text reads `η δε μαρια` ("but Mary"), suggesting a contrast; while the men remained hidden in fear, *but* Mary and her companions acted. They waited for the Law to be fulfilled (`διαγενομε του ϲαββατου`), for grace does not destroy the Law but supersedes it. They come to anoint a corpse (`αλιψωϲιν αυ`), not expecting the Living God; their devotion is true, though their faith is yet asleep.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και λιαν πρωϊ · τη μια των ϲαββατ ερχονται επι το > μνημα μνημιον ανατιλ του ηλιου ˙

**English Translation**
And very early, on the first of the sabbaths, they come to the tomb tomb, the sun having risen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the hand of the scribe trembles before the mystery, writing `μνημα μνημιον`—"tomb tomb"—a stutter in the ink, perhaps correcting the form, or perhaps emphasizing the finality of the grave which is about to be shattered. It is the "first of the sabbaths" (the Lord’s Day), and the text notes `ανατιλ του ηλιου` (the sun having risen). Do not miss the typology: the physical sun rises only because the Sun of Righteousness has already risen from the earth. The light of the world greets the Light of the World.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγον προϲ > εαυταϲ τιϲ αποκυ ημιν τον > λιθον εκ τηϲ θυ> του μνημει ˙

**English Translation**
And they were saying to themselves: Who will roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The women are consumed by the practical impossibility of their task. `τιϲ αποκυ` (Who will roll away?): this is the question of all humanity before the weight of mortality. The stone (`λιθον`) seals the `θυ>` (door) of the tomb, representing the hardness of the heart and the finality of death which no human hand can move. They seek a man to move the stone, unaware that the Son of Man has already moved the earth itself.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και αναβλεψα θεωρουϲιν α τον λιθον · ην γαρ μεγαϲ ϲφοδρα

**English Translation**
And having looked up, they behold [that] the stone [is rolled back]; for it was very great.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is rugged, `θεωρουϲιν α` (they behold [that]...), with the participle for "rolled away" merely implied or lost in the scribe's haste. Yet the theological point stands: `αναβλεψα` (having looked up). Faith requires looking up from the dust of the earth. The reason for their wonder is given: `ην γαρ μεγαϲ ϲφοδρα` (for it was very great). The magnitude of the obstacle serves only to magnify the power of the Resurrection. Where human strength fails, divine power prevails.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲελθουϲαι ειϲ το μνημειον · ει> νεανιϲκον καθημενον εν τοιϲ δεξιοιϲ περι ϲτο λευκην · και εξεθαμβηθη>> ˙

**English Translation**
And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe; and they were amazed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They enter the place of death and find life. They see not a corpse, but a `νεανιϲκον` (young man)—angelic youthfulness which does not age. He sits `εν τοιϲ δεξιοιϲ` (on the right), the side of favor and authority. His garment is a `ϲτο λευκην` (white robe), the livery of heaven, unspotted by the decay of the grave. Their reaction is `εξεθαμβηθη`, a deep, shocking amazement. The holiness of God, when encountered in the land of the dead, produces terror in the flesh.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ο δε λεγει αυταιϲ μη εκθαμβειϲθε · ϊηϲουν ζητει> τον ναζαρηνον τον εϲταυ> ηγερ ουκ εϲτιν > ωδε ιδε ο τοποϲ οπου εθηκαν > αυτον

**English Translation**
But he says to them: Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus the Nazarene, the Crucified One. He was raised! He is not here; see the place where they laid him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the Kerygma in its purest form. The messenger names Him by His humiliation: `τον ναζαρηνον` (the Nazarene) and `τον εϲταυ>` (the Crucified). He does not hide the Cross; He glories in it. But the proclamation shifts instantly: `ηγερ` (He was raised). It is a divine passive—God the Father has vindicated the Son. The proof is empirical: `ιδε ο τοποϲ` (see the place). The emptiness of the tomb is the fullness of our hope. He is not here (`ουκ εϲτιν ωδε`), for He is everywhere.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
αλλα υπαγετε ει τοιϲ μα αυτου και τω πετρω · οτι προαγει ϋ> ειϲ την γα · εκει > αυτον οψεϲθε καθωϲ ειπεν > ϋμιν ·

**English Translation**
But go, say to his disciples and to Peter, that he goes before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, just as he said to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is to `υπαγετε` (go). The Gospel cannot remain in the tomb; it must be spoken. Note the specific mercy in the text: `και τω πετρω` (and to Peter). The one who denied Him is specifically invited back into the fold. They are sent to `γα` (Galilee), the place of humble beginnings, away from the religious pride of Jerusalem. The promise is sight: `οψεϲθε` (you shall see). The word of the Lord (`καθωϲ ειπεν`) is the guarantor of this reality.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθουϲαι εφυγον απο > > του μνημειου · ειχεν γαρ αυταϲ τρομοϲ και εκ> · και ου> ουδεν ει> εφοβουν γαρʼ ⌇﹏

**English Translation**
And going out, they fled from the tomb; for trembling and ecstasy held them; and to no one did they say anything; for they were afraid.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here, the Codex falls silent. The women flee in `τρομοϲ` (trembling) and `εκ>` (ecstasy/displacement of mind). The text ends with `εφοβουν γαρ` (for they were afraid). There is no appearance to the Eleven, no Great Commission, only the raw, trembling awe of the creature before the empty tomb. The scribe marks the end with the coronis (`⌇﹏`), confirming that in this ancient tradition, the Gospel closes in silence. It leaves us, the readers, standing at the door of the tomb. The fear of the women is the beginning of wisdom; the silence invites us to speak the news that they, in this moment, could not. The text ends, but the Faith begins.
