**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εκπορευομε αυτου εκ του ϊε λεγει αυτω ειϲ των μαθητων αυ διδαϲκαλε διδαϲκαλε ϊδε πο λιθοι και πο οικοδομαι

**English Translation**
And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him: Teacher, Teacher, see what manner of stones and what manner of buildings.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciple calls out with a doubled invocation, "Teacher, Teacher," betraying an urgent fascination with the material grandeur of the temple. By repeating the title, the text exposes the disciple's struggle to reconcile the visible permanence of the stones with the spiritual authority of the Master. The question concerns "what manner" of construction stands before them, yet the repetition implies that the disciple seeks a teaching deeper than mere architectural admiration, looking to the Teacher to define the true nature of these stones.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ο ειπεν αυτω βλεπιϲ ταυταϲ ταϲ μεγαλαϲ οικοδομαϲ ου μη αφεθη ωδε λιθοϲ επι λιθον · οϲ ου καταλυθηϲετε μη καταλυθη

**English Translation**
And he said to him: You see these great buildings? There shall not be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down, not be thrown down.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prophecy of destruction is sealed with a solemn reiteration at the close: "not be thrown down, not be thrown down." This doubling of the negation regarding the standing stones serves as a divine guarantee of the total dismantling of the old order. He does not merely predict ruin but emphasizes the impossibility of any stone remaining in its place. The greatness of the buildings, which the disciple admired, is swallowed by the certainty of the judgment that declares they shall utterly fall.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και καθημενου αυτου ειϲ το οροϲ τ ελαιων κατεναν του ϊερου επηρω αυτον κατ ϊδιαν ο πετροϲ και ϊακωβοϲ και ϊωαννηϲ ϊωανηϲ ϊωαννηϲ και αν

**English Translation**
And as he was sitting on the mount of the olives opposite the temple, Peter and Jacob and John, John, John, and Andrew asked him in private:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text distinguishes John with a threefold repetition of his name, signaling a profound emphasis on his presence or his specific witness among the four. While Peter, Jacob, and Andrew are named once, the tripling of "John, John, John" marks him out in the company of the inquirers, drawing attention to his role in receiving these mysteries. They sit opposite the temple, the judgment seat facing the condemned sanctuary, asking privately about the end.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
ειπον ημ ημ · ποτε ταυτα εϲται · και τι το ϲημιον οταν μελλη ταυτα ϲυντελιϲθαι παν

**English Translation**
Tell us, us, when these things will be? And what the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples' plea is intensified by the repetition "Tell us, us," revealing their deep personal anxiety and desire for inclusion in this secret knowledge. They ask not only for the time but for the sign of the consummation of "all" things. The doubling of the pronoun suggests a desperate need for the community of the faithful to be reassured and instructed directly by the Lord concerning the final accomplishment of history.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ηρξατο λεγιν αυτοιϲ βλεπε μη τιϲ πλα ·

**English Translation**
And he began to say to them: See lest any decei[ve]:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord begins his discourse with a command to vigilance, but the warning against deception is cut short in the text, leaving the word "decei[ve]" suspended. This abruptness functions as a sharp alert; the danger of deception is so immediate that the warning breaks off, commanding the hearer to fill in the silence with watchfulness. The priority is not merely to know the future, but to "See" ensuring that the eyes of the faithful remain open against the seduction of error.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
πολλοι ελευ επι τω ονο μου λεγοντεϲ οτι εγω ειμι και πολλουϲ πλανηϲου

**English Translation**
Many will come in my name saying that I am; and many they will deceive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The usurpation of the divine name is the tool of the many who come. By claiming "I am," these false ones attempt to seize the prerogative of the Lord. The text confirms the success of this malice, stating that they will indeed deceive many. The brevity of the phrasing "in my name" juxtaposed with the stark claim "I am" exposes the blasphemy at the heart of the final tribulation, where the identity of the Christ is stolen to lead the many into error.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ὁταν δε ακουϲη πολεμουϲ και α πολεμων ο ορατε μη θροειϲθε θροειϲθαι · δει γαρ γενεϲθαι · αλλ ου το τελοϲ ·

**English Translation**
But when you hear of wars and r[umors] of wars, see, do not be troubled, be troubled; for it must happen, but the end is not yet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command regarding fear is delivered with a paradoxical repetition: "do not be troubled, be troubled." This mirrors the internal conflict of the believer who hears the tumult of wars—the spirit is commanded to peace, yet the flesh trembles. The Lord acknowledges the necessity of these events; they "must happen." The repetition serves to steady the shaking soul, enforcing the command to remain firm even as the natural reaction to such news is disturbance.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
εγερ εγερθηϲεται γαρ εθνοϲ επ εθνοϲ και βαϲι βαϲιλια επι βαϲιλειαν εϲονται ϲιϲμοι κατα τοπουϲ εϲονται λιμοι αρχη ωδινων ταυ :

**English Translation**
For nation shall rise, rise against nation, and kingdom, kingdom against kingdom; there shall be earthquakes in places, there shall be famines; these are the beginning of birth-pains.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The violence of the nations is inscribed in the text through the stuttering repetition "rise, rise" and "kingdom, kingdom." This emphasizes the relentless, surging nature of the conflict where power clashes against power. The earthquakes and famines are not finalities but merely the "beginning of birth-pains," signifying that this suffering is generative, leading toward a new creation rather than meaningless destruction. The repetition underscores the intensity of the upheaval that initiates the end.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
βλεπετε δε ϋμειϲ εαυτουϲ παραδωϲουϲιν γαρ ϋμαϲ ειϲ ϲυνεδρια και ειϲ ϲυναγωγαϲ δαρηϲεϲθε και επι ηγεμονων και βα ϲταθηϲε ϲταθηϲεϲθαι ενεκεν εμου ειϲ μαρτυριον αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
But look to yourselves; for they will deliver you up to councils and to synagogues; you shall be beaten and before governors and ki[ngs] you shall stand, you shall stand, for my sake, for a testimony to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The exhortation to "look to yourselves" turns the disciples' gaze inward to their own endurance. The trial involves standing before authorities, emphasized by the double proclamation "you shall stand, you shall stand." This repetition acts as a promise of divine sustenance; though they are beaten and delivered up, their stance is firm and reiterated. It is solely "for my sake" that they endure this double standing, transforming their trial into a testimony directed at their persecutors.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲ παντα τα εθνη πρωτον προϲ τον πρωτον λαον δει κηρυχθηναι το ευ

**English Translation**
And to all the nations first, to the first people, must be preached the go[spel].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reveals a specific order in the divine economy: the proclamation goes "to all the nations," yet it is directed "first to the first people." This emphasizes the covenantal priority within the universal mission. The necessity is absolute—it "must be preached." The word for gospel is curtailed to "go[spel]," suggesting the urgency of the message which rushes forth to both the nations and the ancient people before the end comes.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και οταν αγωϲιν ϋ παραδιδοντεϲ μη προμεριμνα τι λαληϲητε · αλ ο εαν δοθη ϋμιν εν εκεινη τη ωρα τουτο λαλιτε ου γαρ εϲτε ϋμιϲ οι λαλο αλλα το το α ·

**English Translation**
And when they lead you, delivering you up, do not be anxious beforehand what you should speak; but whatever is given to you in that hour, this speak; for you are not the ones speaking, but the Holy Spirit.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the displacement of human anxiety by divine possession. The command `μη προμεριμνα` (do not be anxious beforehand) silences the fretful mind, for the crisis belongs not to the accused but to the Advocate. It is not the intellect of the man that defends the truth, but `το πνευμα το αγιον` (the Holy Spirit) utilizing the tongue of flesh; thus, the believer becomes a vessel, and the speech given (`δοθη`) in that precise hour is the voice of God resonating through human frailty.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και παραδω αδελφοϲ αδελ ειϲ θανατον · και πατηρʼ τεκν και επαναϲτηϲ τεκνα επι γονιϲ και θανατωϲουϲ αυτουϲ ·

**English Translation**
And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father child, and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The order of nature is dissolved by the severity of the days. The bond of blood, once the surest sanctuary, becomes a mechanism of betrayal; `αδελφοϲ` (brother) hands over `αδελφον` (brother) not to safety, but to `θανατον` (death). We observe a terrifying inversion where those generated (`τεκνα`) rise up (`επαναϲτηϲονται`) to destroy their generators (`γονιϲ`), proving that the division caused by the Truth cuts deeper than the womb.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και εϲεϲθε μιϲουμενοι π δια το ονομα μου ο δε ϋπομιναϲ ειϲ τελοϲ ουτοϲ ϲω

**English Translation**
And you will be hated by [all] on account of my name; but the one having endured to the end, this one will be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Universal hatred (`μιϲουμενοι`) strikes the faithful not for their crimes, but solely `δια το ονομα μου` (on account of my name). Yet, this hostility is the crucible of salvation. The promise is not given to the one who begins, but strictly to the one `ϋπομιναϲ` (having endured) until the absolute completion (`τελοϲ`); only in the finality of endurance is the certainty of being saved (`ϲωθηϲεται`) secured.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
οταν δε ϊδητε το βδελυγμα τηϲ ερη εϲτηκο οπου ου δι · ο ανα νοει : τοτε οι εν τη ϊουδαι φευγετωϲαν ειϲ τα ορη ·

**English Translation**
But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it must not—let the reader understand—then let those in Judea flee to the mountains.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The visible sign is a violation of sanctity: the `βδελυγμα` (abomination) occupies a place forbidden to it (`οπου ου δει`). This sight demands spiritual intelligence (`νοει`) from the reader to recognize the profanation. The response is not resistance but rapid separation; the command is to abandon the province (`ϊουδαια`) and ascend to the `ορη` (mountains), seeking refuge in the heights away from the polluted holy place.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ο δε επι του δωματοϲ μη κα μηδε ειϲελ αραι τι εκ τηϲ οικιαϲ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And the one on the housetop, let him not come down nor enter to take anything out of his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Survival requires the total abandonment of earthly goods. The one positioned above on the `δωματοϲ` (housetop) must not make the fatal error of descending (`καταβατω`) into the `οικιαϲ` (house) to retrieve possessions. The attachment to things (`τι`) becomes a snare; life is preserved only by looking outward to escape, never inward to gather what must be left behind.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και ο ειϲ τον αγρον μη ε οπιϲω αραι το ϊματιον αυτου

**English Translation**
And the one into the field, let him not turn back to take his garment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the necessary covering of the body is of less worth than the soul's safety. The laborer in the `αγρον` (field) is forbidden the backward glance or the return motion (`μη επιϲτρεψατω οπιϲω`). To seek the `ϊματιον` (garment) is to delay, and in this tribulation, delay is death; one must flee exposed rather than perish clothed.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ουαι δε ταιϲ εν γαϲτρι εχουϲαιϲ και ταιϲ θηλαζουϲαιϲ εν ε ταιϲ ημεραιϲ

**English Translation**
But woe to those having in the womb, and to those nursing in those days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The natural blessings of fruitfulness become heavy burdens in the time of wrath. The cry of `ουαι` (woe) is raised for those whose physical state—bearing life (`εν γαϲτρι`) or sustaining it (`θηλαζουϲαιϲ`)—impedes the swiftness required for flight. The severity of `ταιϲ ημεραιϲ` (those days) transforms the tender duties of the mother into distinct vulnerabilities.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
προϲευχεϲθε δε ϊνα μη γενηται η φυγη ϋμων χιμω

**English Translation**
But pray that your flight may not happen in winter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Human supplication (`προϲευχεϲθε`) is brought to bear against the harshness of the elements. We are taught to entreat God that the necessity of `φυγη` (flight) does not coincide with the severity of `χειμωνοϲ` (winter), lest the cold and the impassable roads compound the suffering. Prayer here navigates the timing of the inevitable.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
εϲονται γαρ αι ημε εκειναι θλιψιϲ οια ου γεγονεν τοι απ αρχηϲ κτι ην εκτιϲ ο εωϲ του νυν κ(αι) ου μη γενηται

**English Translation**
For those days will be tribulation, such as has not happened such from the beginning of creation which God created until now, and never will be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The `θλιψιϲ` (tribulation) is marked by a singular intensity unparalleled in history. It spans the entirety of time, compared against everything from the `αρχηϲ κτιϲεωϲ` (beginning of creation) which `ο θεοϲ` (God) framed, up to the present `νυν` and into the future. It stands as a unique peak of suffering that shall never be repeated (`ου μη γενηται`), a solitary and terrible monument in the age.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και ει μη εκολοβω ταϲ ημεραϲ ουκ αν εϲωθη πα ϲαρξ αλλα δια τουϲ εκλεκτουϲ ουϲ ε εκολο ταϲ ημεραϲ

**English Translation**
And unless [he] shortened the days, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the elect whom he chose, he shortened the days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The preservation of humanity relies solely on the divine curtailing of time. Unless the Lord `εκολοβωϲεν` (shortened) the duration of wrath, `παϲα ϲαρξ` (all flesh) would be consumed. Mercy is extended strictly `δια τουϲ εκλεκτουϲ` (on account of the elect); it is for the sake of those He `εξελεξατο` (chose) that the catastrophe is arrested, proving that the cosmos is governed for the sake of the chosen ones.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε εαν τιϲ ϋμ ειπη ειδε ωδε ο ειδε εκει μη πι

**English Translation**
And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here [is] the [One]; look, there!' do not believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "do not believe" stands as a fortress against the chaos of the end. We are warned that voices will clamor, pointing to specific locations—"here" or "there"—claiming the presence of the Lord. But the true presence requires no such pointing by men; to chase after a localized report is to abandon the universal truth of His coming.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
εγερθηϲ δε ψευδοχριϲτοι και ψευδοπροφη και δωϲουϲιν ϲημια και τερατα προϲ το αποπλαν ει δυνατον τουϲ εκ

**English Translation**
But false christs and false prophets will arise, and they will give signs and wonders in order to lead astray, if possible, the elect.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the enemy mimics the divine economy: as there is a true Christ and true prophets, so too do "false christs and false prophets" arise. Their power is real—they "give signs and wonders"—but their purpose is ruin. The severity of this trial is shown in its target: they aim to deceive even "the elect," proving that only the most vigilant adherence to truth will withstand the assault.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
υμειϲ δε βλεπετε προειρηκα ϋμιν παντα

**English Translation**
But you, watch; I have foretold all things to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord grants us the weapon of foreknowledge. By saying "I have foretold all things," He strips the future of its terror, for nothing that occurs is outside His sovereignty. The command to "watch" is not a call to anxiety, but to a settled confidence that the Master has already outlined the path of tribulation.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
αλλα εν εκειναιϲ ταιϲ ημεραιϲ μετα τ θλιψιν εκεινην ο ηλιοϲ ϲκοτιϲθη και η ϲεληνη ου δωϲι το φεγγοϲ αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Creation itself participates in the judgment, withdrawing its light before the Uncreated Light approaches. The "sun" and "moon" fail, marking the end of the natural order we rely upon. This darkness is not random but follows a strict sequence: it comes "after that tribulation," signaling the transition from earthly suffering to divine intervention.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και οι αϲτερεϲ εϲονται εκ του ου πιπτοντεϲ και αι δυναμειϲ αι εν τοιϲ ου ο ϲα ·

**English Translation**
And the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The firmament, which appears immutable to human eyes, proves temporary. When the "powers that are in the heavens" are shaken, the structure of the universe collapses to make way for the Kingdom. The falling "stars" demonstrate that no high thing can stand when the time of the end arrives; all created height is humbled.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε οψονται τον του ανθρωπου ερχομενον εν νε μετα δυνα πολληϲ και δοξηϲ

**English Translation**
And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with much power and glory.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the answer to the false pointers of "here" and "there." The "Son of Man" arrives not in a secret chamber but "in clouds," visible to all. He comes clothed in "much power and glory," a majestic advent that requires no human messenger to announce it, for the sight of Him will be undeniable to the world.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε α τουϲ αγγε αυτου και επι τουϲ εκλε αυτου εκ τ τ τεϲϲαρων ανεμ απ ακρου γηϲ εωϲ ακρου ουρανου ·

**English Translation**
And then He will send His angels and will gather His elect from the four winds, from the end of the earth to the end of heaven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gathering is the prerogative of the Lord, executed by "His angels." The "elect" are not abandoned in the cosmic dissolution but are collected with precision from the "four winds." The scope is absolute, spanning from the "end of the earth to the end of heaven," assuring us that no distance or hiding place can separate the chosen from their Shepherd.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
απο δε τηϲ ϲυκηϲ μαθετε την παρα οταν ηδη ο κλαδοϲ αυτηϲ α γενηται κ(αι) εκφυη τα φυλλα γι οτι εγ το θεροϲ εϲτ ·

**English Translation**
Now from the fig tree learn the parable: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nature is appointed as our instructor. As the "fig tree" softens and produces "leaves" to herald the "summer," so do the events of history herald the Kingdom. We are not to be dull of hearing or sight; we must apply the same discernment to the signs of the times that we apply to the seasons of the harvest.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ και ϋμιϲ ο ϊδητε ταυτα γι γινωϲκε οτι εγγυϲ εϲτιν επι θυραιϲ ·

**English Translation**
So also you, when you see these things happening, know that He is near, at the doors.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observation leads to realization. When "these things" are seen, we are not to doubt, but to "know." The proximity of the Judge is described with terrifying intimacy: He is "at the doors." There is no remaining buffer of time or space; the threshold is about to be crossed.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι ου μη παρελθη η γε αυτη μεχρι ταυτα παντα γενη ·

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things take place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord seals His prophecy with "Amen," the word of absolute truth. "This generation" serves as the vessel for fulfillment; the timeframe is bound and certain. The passing of the world is less certain than the accomplishment of "all these things," for the word of Christ sustains the very generation that witnesses His power.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ο ουρανοϲ και η γη παρελευϲον · οι δε λογοι μου ου μη παρελευϲον

**English Translation**
The heaven and the earth shall pass away; but my words shall by no means pass away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mutability of the created cosmos is absolute; even the firmament of heaven and the foundations of the earth are destined for dissolution. In contrast, the utterance of the Lord possesses an eternal substance superior to the physical elements, for while the visible structure of the world is transient, the divine decree remains fixed and imperishable.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
περι δε τηϲ ημεραϲ εκεινηϲ και τηϲ ω ουδειϲ οιδεν ουδε οι αγγελοι ουρανω ουδε ο ει μη ο πατηρ :

**English Translation**
But concerning that day and the hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the [one], if not the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The knowledge of the final appointed time is sealed within the mystery of the Father, inaccessible to any created intellect or celestial power. The text establishes a hierarchy of exclusion, where even the angels resident in heaven and the [one] designated by the article are set apart from this specific foreknowledge, leaving the Father as the sole possessor of the secret.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
βλεπετε αγρυπνι και προϲευχεϲθε ουκ οιδαται γαρ πο ο καιροϲ εϲτ

**English Translation**
Take heed, be sleepless and pray; for you do not know when the time is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ignorance of the specific moment necessitates a perpetual state of wakefulness, here commanded as a discipline of sleeplessness combined with prayer. Because the precise time remains hidden from human understanding, the soul must maintain a constant vigil, lest the kairos arrive and find the spirit unprepared.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
ωϲ ανθρωποϲ απο αφιϲ την οικιαν αυτου και δουϲ τοιϲ δουλοιϲ αυτου την εξουϲι εκαϲτω το εργ αυτου και τω θυρω ενετιλατο ϊνα γρηγορη ·

**English Translation**
As a man [going] abroad left his house and gave to his slaves the authority, to each his work, and to the doorkeeper he commanded that he should watch.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master's absence defines the present economy of the household, wherein authority is distributed alongside specific labors to his servants. The command emphasizes the role of the doorkeeper, whose primary duty is not merely labor but active vigilance, ensuring the security of the house against the uncertainty of the return.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
γρηγορι ουν ουκ οιδατε γαρ ποτε ο τηϲ οι ερχεται · η ο η μεϲονυκτι · η αλεκτοροφω · η πρωϊ ·

**English Translation**
Watch therefore, for you do not know when the [lord] of the [house] comes; either [at] evening, or midnight, or cockcrow, or morning.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The span of the night is divided into four watches, symbolizing the totality of the dark age in which the faithful must remain alert. Whether the return occurs at the onset of darkness or the breaking of the dawn, the uncertainty of the hour compels the church to sustain attention throughout every phase of the world's slumber.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
μη ελ εξεφνηϲ ευ ϋμαϲ καθευδ ·

**English Translation**
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The suddenness of the arrival serves as a test of the soul's condition, threatening to expose those who have succumbed to spiritual lethargy. To be found sleeping is to be caught in a state of negligence, having abandoned the duty of the watch for the comfort of the flesh.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ϋμιν λεγω παϲιν λεγω γρηγο

**English Translation**
And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The instruction given to the immediate hearers is universalized, extending the mandate of vigilance to every member of the body without exception. The final imperative to watch binds all generations to the same expectation, dissolving any distinction between the disciples and the multitude in the face of the coming judgment.
