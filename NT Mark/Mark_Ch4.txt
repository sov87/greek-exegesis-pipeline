**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και παλιν ηρξατο διδαϲκιν παρα τ τ θαλαϲϲαν και ϲυ ϲ προϲ αυ οχλοϲ πλιϲτοϲ ωϲτε αυτον ειϲ πλοι εμβαντα κα εν τη θα και παϲ ο οχλοϲ προϲ την θαλαϲϲαν επι τηϲ γηϲ ηϲαν

**English Translation**
And again he began to teach by the the sea; and gathered to him a crowd, very great, so that he, embarking into a boat, sat in the sea; and all the crowd was toward the sea on the land.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Teacher separates himself, sitting "in the sea" within the fragility of the "boat," while the multitude remains firm "on the land." This spatial division establishes the holy distance required for instruction; the Wisdom of God speaks from the unstable waters, commanding attention from the stability of the earth. The repetition of "sea" and "land" emphasizes the boundary between the divine source of doctrine and the earthly nature of those who receive it.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και εδι αυτουϲ πολ εν παραβολαιϲ και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ εν τη διδαχη αυτου

**English Translation**
And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He does not merely speak but delivers "teaching," a structured and authoritative body of truth. The use of "parables" to convey "many things" indicates that the mysteries are veiled in familiar forms, protecting the pearls while offering them. The doctrine is enclosed "in his teaching," suggesting that the understanding of these many things is found only within the specific scope of his authority.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ακουετε ϊδου εξηλθεν ο ϲπι του ϲπειραι

**English Translation**
Hear ye: Behold, the sower went out to sow.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imperative "Hear ye" demands the complete submission of the senses before the revelation begins. The "sower" initiates the action solely by his own will, going "out" from his hidden abode to scatter the seed. There is no mention of the soil’s request or preparation; the act is entirely one of divine gratuity and outward movement.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν τω ϲπι ο μεν επεϲ παρα την οδον και ηλθεν τα πετι και κατεφαγ αυτο

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in the sowing, some indeed fell by the way, and the birds came and devoured it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The seed falls "in the sowing," an act that occurs broadly and without prejudice. That which lands "by the way" is immediately exposed and vulnerable, finding no entry into the heart. The "birds" represent the swift, marauding forces that steal the gift before it can be received, resulting in total loss as the word is "devoured."

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και αλλο επεϲεν επι τα πετρωδη το πετρωδεϲ οπου ουκ ειχεν γην πολλην και ευθυϲ εξανετι δια το μη εχ βαθοϲ γηϲ

**English Translation**
And another fell upon the rocky places, the rocky part, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up because of not having depth of earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text emphasizes the hardness with the repetition of "rocky places, the rocky part." The response is deceptively rapid; it "immediately sprang up" not from vigor, but from the inability to penetrate downward. The lack of "depth of earth" forces a superficial display of life that has no foundation to sustain it.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και ο ανετιλεν ο η εκαυματιϲθη και δια το μη εχιν ριζαν εξηρανθη

**English Translation**
And when rose the sun, it was scorched; and because of not having root, it withered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "sun" acts as the inevitable trial that tests the reality of the growth. The failure is internal—"not having root"—rendering the plant incapable of drawing sustenance when the heat arises. It is not the sun that destroys, but the rootlessness that ensures the plant "withered" under the light.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και αλλοϲ αλλο επεϲ ειϲ ταϲ ακανθαϲ και ανεβηϲαν αι ακανθαι και ϲυ αυτο και καρπον ουκ ε

**English Translation**
And another other fell into the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and fruit it did not give.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the soil possesses vitality, but it is shared with "thorns" which rise up alongside the seed. The tragedy is the cohabitation of the word with worldly cares, where the thorns "choked" the divine life. The ultimate failure is negative and sterile: "fruit it did not give," marking the end of the struggle as barrenness.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και αλλα αλλο αλλα επεϲεν ειϲ την γην την καλην και εδιδου καρπον αναβαι και αυξα και εφε ειϲ · · και ειϲ · · και ειϲ · ·

**English Translation**
And others other others fell into the earth the good, and gave fruit coming up and increasing and brought forth into . . and into . . and into . .

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers with the abundance of "others other others," reflecting the multiplication of life in "the earth the good." The fruit is dynamic, "coming up and increasing," indicating a progressive sanctification. The yields "into . ." serve as placeholders for a fullness of reward that exceeds simple numbering, a tripartite ascent of spiritual fruitfulness.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγ οϲ εχει ο εχων ωτα ακου ακουετω

**English Translation**
And he said: Who has, the one having ears to hear, let him hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A distinction is made between the general possession of ears and the specific capacity of "the one having ears to hear." The command "let him hear" places the burden of spiritual perception upon the individual. It is not enough to be present; one must possess the interior faculty to receive the resonance of the divine voice.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και οτε εγενετο κατα μοναϲ ηρω αυτον οι πε αυτον ϲυν τοιϲ · · ταϲ παραβολαϲ

**English Translation**
And when he became alone, asked him those around him with the . . the parables.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The revelation of the deeper mysteries requires solitude ("alone"). A specific group, "those around him with the . .", separates from the general crowd to inquire. Their question concerns "the parables," seeking the hidden logic of the Kingdom that is not given to the casual listener but reserved for the intimates.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ ϋμιν το μυϲτηρι δεδοται τηϲ βα του εκει δε τοιϲ εξω εν παραβολαιϲ π γεινεται ·

**English Translation**
And he said to them: To you the mystery is given of the Kingdom of the; but to those, the outsiders, in parables all things happen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "mystery" is a gift "given" by grace, not seized by intellect, pertaining to the "Kingdom." For "the outsiders," reality is mediated and obscure, where "all things happen" in parables. This establishes a boundary between the initiates who possess the core truth and those who perceive only the external, riddling forms.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ϊνα βλε βλεπωϲι βλεπωϲ και μη ϊδωϲι ϊδωϲιν και ακουοντεϲ ακου ακουωϲιν και μη ϲυνϊω μηποτε επι και αφεθη αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
That seeing they may see seeing, and not see see; and hearing hear hear, and not understand; lest at any time they turn, and it be forgiven them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The intense repetition—"see seeing," "see see," "hear hear"—emphasizes a fullness of sensory experience that is paradoxically void of perception ("not see," "not understand"). The purpose is judicial: they are permitted the physical sensation but denied the spiritual comprehension. This blinding prevents them from the ability to "turn" and receive the remission that comes when "it be forgiven," preserving the mystery for the elect.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ ουκ οιδατε την πα ταυτην και πωϲ παϲαϲ ταϲ παραβολαϲ γνω

**English Translation**
And he says to them, Do you not know this parable? And how will you know all the parables?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master establishes a hierarchy of understanding. Ignorance of "this parable" is not merely a singular failure but a systemic blindness that prevents the comprehension of "all the parables." The specific instruction serves as the key to the universal teaching; without the former, the latter remains inaccessible.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
ο ϲπιρων τον λογ ϲπερει ·

**English Translation**
The sower sows the word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The identity of the sower is entirely subsumed by his action and his instrument. He does not sow grain or earthly seed, but exclusively "the word." The act of sowing is the fundamental distribution of this divine logos, defining the sower’s sole purpose in this text.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ουτοι δε ειϲιν οι παρα τ οδον οπου ϲπιρε ο λογοϲ και ο ακουϲωϲιν ευθυϲ ερχεται ο ϲαταναϲ και αρπα τον λογον τ εϲπαρμενον εν αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And these are the ones by the road where the word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word sown in them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The location "by the road" signifies a place of exposure and transit rather than cultivation. There is a terrifying synchronization between the hearing and the theft; "immediately" upon the auditory act, Satan acts to remove the deposit. The word was truly "in them," yet the enemy removes it before it can claim the soil.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και ουτοι ομοιωϲ ειϲιν οι επι τα πε ϲπιρομε · οι οταν ακου τον λογον ευθυϲ μετα χαραϲ λαμβανουϲιν αυ

**English Translation**
And these likewise are the ones being sown upon the rocky places; who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the immediacy is not of theft, but of emotional reception ("with joy"). The rocky places produce a response that is swift but superficial. The text identifies these individuals as "ones being sown," uniting the recipient and the ground into a single reality under the seed.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ εχου εχουϲιν ριζαν εν εαυτοιϲ αλλα προϲκαιροι ειϲιν · ειτα γενο θλιψεωϲ η διωγμου δια τον λογον ευθυϲ ϲκανδαλιζονται ·

**English Translation**
And they do not have root in themselves but are temporary; then, affliction or persecution arising because of the word, immediately they are stumbled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The absence of an internal root renders the believer "temporary." Paradoxically, the very "word" which brought joy becomes the cause of the "affliction or persecution." Because the root is lacking, the pressure applied on account of the word leads "immediately" to stumbling rather than endurance.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και αλλοι ειϲιν οι επι ταϲ ακανθαϲ ϲπιρομενοι ︴ ου ειϲιν οι ακουϲ τον λογον

**English Translation**
And others are the ones being sown among the thorns; these are the ones having heard the word,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A distinction is made for "others" who are defined by their environment: "among the thorns." They possess the capacity to hear the word, yet they exist in a crowded soil where the word is not the sole inhabitant.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και αι μεριμναι του αι και η απατη του πλουτου ϲυν τον λογον και αι παρα περι τα λοι επιθυμιαι ειϲ ϲυνπνιγουϲιν τον λογον και ακαρποϲ γεινεται

**English Translation**
and the cares of the age and the deceit of wealth... and the desires concerning the rest entering choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Three forces—cares, wealth, and desires—conspire to "choke" the single word. The word is not removed as it was by the road, nor abandoned as on the rocks, but it is strangled by competition. The tragedy is the state of being "unfruitful," where the seed exists but produces nothing.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και εκεινοι ειϲιν οι επι την γην τ καλην ϲπαρεντεϲ · οιτινεϲ ακουουϲι τον λογον και πα και καρποφορουϲιν εν · · και εν · · και εν · ·

**English Translation**
And those are the ones sown upon the good earth; such as hear the word and receive [it] and bear fruit, in [thirty?] and in [sixty?] and in [hundred?].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "good earth" is characterized by a progression: hearing, receiving, and fruit-bearing. While the yield varies in measure, the essential nature of the soil is uniform in its productivity. The fruit validates the reception of the word.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ μητι ερχεται ο λυ υπο τον μο τεθηναι ϊνα υπο τον μοδιον τεθη η ϋπο την κλινην ουχ ϊνα ϋπο την λυχνιαν τεθη

**English Translation**
And he was saying to them, Does the lamp come to be placed under the bushel or under the bed? [Is it] not that it be placed under the lampstand?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The purpose of the lamp is inherent in its arrival; it does not come to be hidden. The text presents a rigid spatial query: the bushel and bed are sites of concealment. The lamp's destiny is relation to the lampstand, structured here uniquely, emphasizing the necessity of correct placement for function.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ου γαρ εϲτιν τι κρυπτ εαν μη ϊνα φανε ουδε εγενε αποκρυφον αλ ϊνα ελθη ειϲ φα

**English Translation**
For there is nothing hidden except that it be manifested; nor did it become secret but that it might come into light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Concealment is not an end but a means to future revelation. Things are "hidden" and "secret" with the specific intent ("that") of eventual manifestation. The trajectory of all hidden things is inexorably toward the light.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ει τιϲ εχει ωτα ακουειν ακου

**English Translation**
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Possession of the faculty ("ears") mandates the exercise of the function ("hear"). The imperative is conditional; only those equipped with spiritual perception are commanded to utilize it.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ βλεπετε τι ακουε εν ω μετρω με μετρηθηϲε ϋμιν και προϲ ϋμιν

**English Translation**
And he was saying to them, See what you hear. In what measure you measure, it will be measured to you and added to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Hearing is an act requiring visual scrutiny ("See what you hear"). There is a divine economy of reciprocity: the measure employed by the hearer determines the return. Furthermore, there is a surplus ("added to you") granted to those who measure, implying that attention to the word generates abundance beyond the initial deposit.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ εχει δοθηϲε αυτω και οϲ ου εχει και ο εχει αρ απ αυτου

**English Translation**
For whoever has, it will be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine economy operates not by earthly equality but by spiritual capacity. To hold the mystery is to invite greater revelation, for grace accumulates upon those who cultivate it; conversely, to neglect the inner deposit is to forfeit even the semblance of possession, leaving the soul destitute of the truth it failed to cherish.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν ουτωϲ εϲτιν η βαϲιλεια του · ωϲ βαλη τον ϲπορ επι τηϲ γηϲ

**English Translation**
And he said: Thus is the kingdom of the [God]: as if [a man] should cast the seed upon the earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Kingdom of God is defined by the act of sowing, a deliberate release of the word. The sower initiates the work by scattering the seed, yet the process immediately passes from his hand into the nature of the earth, signifying that divine truth enters the world to operate by its own inherent power.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και κα και εγειρε νυκτα και ημε και ο ϲποροϲ βλαϲτανη και μη ωϲ ουκ οι αυτοϲ

**English Translation**
And should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and lengthen, how he himself does not know.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The growth of the holy word occurs in the hidden intervals of human existence, spanning both the rest of the night and the activity of the day. The sower's ignorance of the mechanism does not hinder the seed's ascent; the life within the seed operates independently of human vigilance or understanding.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
αυτο η γη καρπο πρωτον χορ ειτα ϲταχυν ειτεν ειτʼ εν πληρη ϲιτον εν τω ϲτα

**English Translation**
Of itself the earth bears fruit: first grass, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The earth possesses a divinely implanted capacity to bring forth life without external coercion, mirroring the receptive heart. Spiritual maturity follows a necessary and unhurried order: first the tender blade of initial faith, then the structural formation of the ear, and finally the substantial grain of doctrine.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
οταν δε παραδοι παραδω ο καρποϲ ευθυϲ α το δρε οτι παρε ο θεριϲμοϲ

**English Translation**
But when the fruit permits, immediately he sends the sickle, because the harvest is present.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The consummation of the age awaits the ripeness of the fruit, for judgment is not premature but responds to the completion of the growth cycle. The sickle is sent forth only when the crop has reached its intended fullness, marking the end of the time of growth and the beginning of the gathering.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ πωϲ ο τ βαϲιλειαν του η εν τινι αυτην παραβολη · θωμ

**English Translation**
And he said to them: How shall we liken the kingdom of the [God], or in what parable shall we place it?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The distinct nature of the Kingdom of God requires a diligent search for appropriate earthly vessels to contain its truth. The Lord invites the hearers to consider the magnitude of the comparison, indicating that no single image suffices to exhaust the mystery, requiring us to place it carefully within the parable.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ωϲ κοκκω ϲινα οϲ οταν ϲπαρη επι τηϲ γηϲ ο μι ον π των ϲπερμα των επι τηϲ γηϲ

**English Translation**
As a grain of mustard, which, when it is sown upon the earth, being smaller than all the seeds upon the earth...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Greatness is hidden within the minute, confounding the expectations of the world. The beginning of faith appears insignificant to the eyes of flesh, smaller than all other claims to power or wisdom, yet it contains within its smallness the total potency of the divine order.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και οταν ϲπα αναβαινι και γεινεται μειζον παντων των λα και ποιει κλαδουϲ μεγαλουϲ ωϲτε δυναϲθαι ϋπο την ϲκιαν αυτου τα πετινα του ο κατα

**English Translation**
And when it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the herbs, and makes large branches, so that the birds of the [heaven] are able to dwell under its shadow.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The expansion of the Kingdom defies its humble origins, surpassing all earthly growths to become a dominant structure. It provides a shelter for the souls seeking refuge, the birds of the heaven, who find rest and protection under the vast, spreading branches of the doctrine that once seemed negligible.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και τοιαυταιϲ πα πολλαιϲ ελαλει αυτοιϲ τ λογον καθωϲ η ακουε

**English Translation**
And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The method of teaching is strictly adapted to the capacity of the receiver. The Lord dispenses the word not in overwhelming fullness but through similitudes that the infirmity of the hearers can grasp, measuring the revelation against their ability to listen.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
χωριϲ δε παραβο ουκ ελαλει αυ κατ ϊδιαν δε τοιϲ ϊ μαθηταιϲ ε παντα

**English Translation**
But without a parable he did not speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained all things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is a sharp distinction between the multitude and the disciples. The outer covering of the parable serves the crowd, veiling the truth while presenting it, but the inner interpretation and the solution of all things are reserved for those who have separated themselves to be with him in private.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ εν εκινη τη ημερα οψιαϲ γενομενηϲ διελθωμεν ειϲ το περαν

**English Translation**
And he says to them on that day, when evening had come: Let us go over to the other side.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The transition to the other side marks a movement from teaching to testing, initiated by the Lord’s command. The arrival of evening signifies the close of the dispensation of instruction and the commencement of the journey through the depths, requiring obedience to traverse the boundary.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και αφεν τον οχλον πα αυτον ωϲ ην εν τω πλοιω και αλ πλοια ηϲαν με αυτου

**English Translation**
And leaving the crowd, they take him as he was in the ship; and other ships were with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples separate themselves from the confusion of the crowd to remain with the Lord in the specific vessel where he is present. The presence of other ships indicates that while the Lord is the singular focus, the journey of faith draws others to follow in his wake, partaking in the same voyage.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και γεινε λαιλαψ μεγαϲ μεγαλη ανεμου και τα κυ επεβαλεν ειϲ το πλοιον ωϲτε ηδη γεμιζεϲθαι το πλοιον

**English Translation**
And there arises a storm, great, large, of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that the ship was already being filled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text presents a redundant terror, describing the storm as both *megas* and *megale*—great and large—piling attribute upon attribute to signify the overwhelming nature of the trial. The waves do not merely wash against the vessel but beat into it with violence. The ship is not described as merely in danger but as already being filled; human agency has failed, and the vessel is saturated with the chaotic waters before the Divine intervention begins.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ ην εν τη πρυμνη επι το προϲκεφαλαιον καθευδων : και εγιρουϲιν αυ και λεγουϲιν αυτω διδαϲκαλε ου μελι ϲοι οτι α

**English Translation**
And he himself was in the stern, sleeping upon the cushion; and they wake him and say to him: Teacher, is it no care to you that...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He rests in the stern, the seat of the helmsman, yet he sleeps upon the cushion, revealing the tranquility of the Word amidst the turbulence of the world. The plea of the disciples is abrupt and fractured, ending at the letter *alpha*; their sentence is cut short by the wind or their own terror. They do not finish the word of their destruction, but in their panic, they question the care of the Teacher, mistaking his repose for indifference.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και διεγερθειϲ επε τω ανε και ειπεν τη θαλαϲϲη ϲιωπα · πεφιμωϲο · και ε ο ανεμοϲ και εγενετο γαλη μεγαλη

**English Translation**
And having woken, he rebuked the wind and said to the sea: Silence! Be muzzled! And the wind ceased, and there became a great calm.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority of the Creator is immediate; he does not pray for relief but issues a command to the elements as if to unruly beasts, ordering the sea to be muzzled. The text abbreviates the cessation of the wind, swift as the action itself. The result mirrors the trial: just as the storm was great and large, now the calm is described as great, proving that the peace of God is equal in magnitude to any chaos the world presents.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ελεγεν ειπεν αυτοιϲ τι δειλοι εϲτε ου εχετε πιϲτ

**English Translation**
And he said, was saying, said to them: Why are you cowardly? Do you not have faith?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred record stammers the act of speaking—*eipen, elegen, eipen*—emphasizing the gravity and persistence of his rebuke. He does not accuse them of mere fear, but of cowardice, a moral failing linked directly to their lack of faith. To possess faith is to withstand the storm; to lack it is to succumb to the cowardice that trembles even when the Teacher is present in the vessel.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και εφοβηθηϲ φοβον μεγαν και ελεγον προϲ αλλη τιϲ αρα ουτοϲ εϲτιν οτι και ο α οι ανεμοι ο ανεμοϲ και η θαλαϲ αυτω υπακουει υπακουει αυτω

**English Translation**
And they feared a great fear and were saying to one another: Who then is this, that even the... the winds, the wind and the sea obey him, obey him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples' fear shifts from the elements to the Master, a "great fear" born of witnessing divine power. The text reflects the stammering astonishment of the moment, repeating "the winds, the wind" and doubling the verb "obeys, obeys." This duplication testifies that the obedience of nature is total and repeated; the creation recognizes the voice of its Author, leaving the men to question the identity of the One who commands with such absolute sovereignty.
