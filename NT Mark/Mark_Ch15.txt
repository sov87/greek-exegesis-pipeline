**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ πρω ϲυμβουλιον ετοι οι αρχϊ μετα των πρε και τ γραμματεων και ολον το ϲυνεδρι δηϲαντεϲ τον απηνεγκαν και παρεδωκαν πειλατω

**English Translation**
And immediately [in the] morning, a council having prepared, the High Priests with the Elders and the Scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, having bound Him, carried [Him] away and delivered [Him] to Pilate.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the haste of malice; "immediately" and "morning" reveal that while the righteous slept, the wicked plotted. The text reads *etoi* (prepared/made ready), suggesting a premeditated design by the *archiereis* (High Priests) and the *presbyteroi* (Elders). Behold the great mystery: He who binds the cosmos with laws is Himself "bound" (*desantes*) by the hands of men. They deliver the Lawgiver to the lawless, handing the Holy One to Pilate, a Gentile, signifying that the grace of God is passing from the exclusive custody of the Synagogue to the judgment of the nations.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και επηρωτηϲεν > αυτον ο πειλατοϲ ϲυ ει ο βαϲιλευϲ τ ϊουδαιων ˙ ο δε αποκριθειϲ αυ λεγει ˙ ϲυ λεγειϲ

**English Translation**
And Pilate asked Him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" But answering him, He says, "You say [so]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate asks from a place of earthly power, yet unwittingly confesses the truth. The title "King of the Jews" is spoken by the Gentile governor. The Lord’s reply, "You say," is the perfection of wisdom; He does not deny His sovereignty, nor does He accept the political definition Pilate implies. It is a mirror held up to the judge: the truth is on Pilate's lips, though his heart is far from understanding the Kingdom not of this world.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και κατηγορουν > αυτου οι αρχϊερειϲ πολλα ·

**English Translation**
And the High Priests were accusing Him of many things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *archiereis* heap up accusations ("many things"), thinking that the weight of numbers will crush the Truth. But the text does not dignify these lies by listing them. The silence of the Evangelist regarding the content of these charges reflects the emptiness of the accusations. They accuse the Source of Innocence, exposing their own guilt in the very act of prosecution.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πειλατοϲ πα> επηρωτηϲ αυτον λεγων ουκ απο> ουδεν · ϊδε ποϲα ϲου κατηγο :

**English Translation**
But Pilate again asked Him, saying, "Do you answer nothing? See how many things they accuse you of."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate is bewildered by the lack of defense. The world understands power only as self-assertion; it cannot comprehend the power of *kenosis*, or self-emptying. The abbreviated Greek *kateno* (accuse) in the manuscript rushes to the end of the sentence, just as the accusers rush to judgment. Pilate points to the noise ("how many things"), but Christ dwells in the silence of the Father's will.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ουκετι ουδ απεκριθη · ωϲτε > θαυμαζειν τον πειλατον ˙

**English Translation**
But He no longer answered anything, so that Pilate marveled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the fulfillment of the Prophet Isaiah: "As a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth." The silence of the Word is louder than the clamor of the priests. This silence produces *thaumazein* (wonder/marveling) in the Gentile heart. Pilate stands on the precipice of faith, struck by a dignity that needs no defense, yet he remains paralyzed by his worldly position.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
κατα δε εορτην απε αυτοιϲ ενα δεϲμιον ον παρη ονπερ ητουντο ·

**English Translation**
Now at [the] feast he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The custom of the feast is a shadow of the true liberation. Pilate releases a prisoner of flesh; God is about to release the prisoners of Hades. Yet, observe the tragedy of human will: the "request" (*etounto*) of the people is the mechanism of their own condemnation. They are given a choice, a test of their spiritual sight.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ο λε βαραββαϲ μετα των ϲταϲια δεδεμενοϲ · οιτινεϲ εν τη ϲταϲι φονον τινα πεποι ·

**English Translation**
Now there was the [one] called Barabbas, bound with the insurrectionists, who in the insurrection had committed murder.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The name *Barabbas* signifies "Son of the Father." Here stands the false son, a man of violence and murder, bound in chains. Beside him stands the True Son of the Father, the Prince of Peace, also bound. The world is presented with two "sons": one who takes life (murder) and One who gives Life. The insurrection (*stasis*) of Barabbas is earthly chaos; the revolution of Christ is the overturning of death itself.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και ανα> αναβοηϲαϲ ο οχλοϲ ηρξατο αιτειϲθαι καθωϲ εποιει αυτοιϲ :

**English Translation**
And having shouted out, the crowd began to ask [him to do] just as he used to do for them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript shows a stutter in *ana- anaboesas* (shouted up/cried out), reflecting the surging, chaotic noise of the mob. They do not ask for justice; they ask for custom ("as he used to do"). They are slaves to habit and ritual, blind to the Kairos—the moment of divine visitation standing before them. They clamor for a favor from Rome while rejecting the Grace of God.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πειλατοϲ απεκρι αυτοιϲ λεγων θε απολυϲω ϋμ τον βαϲιλεα των ϊου

**English Translation**
But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you wish [that] I release to you the King of the Jews?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate presses the title again: *Basilea ton Ioudaion* (King of the Jews). He offers them their King, perhaps in mockery, perhaps in a desperate attempt to bypass the priests by appealing to the crowd's national pride. But in doing so, he places the fate of the King in the hands of a people who have already rejected His Kingdom.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
εγνωκει εγινωϲκε γαρ οτι δια φθονον πα αυ οι αρχϊερειϲ ·

**English Translation**
For he knew [was knowing] that because of envy the High Priests had handed Him over.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe's correction from *egnokei* (had known) to *aginoske* (was knowing) emphasizes Pilate's dawning realization. He sees the root of the sin: *phthonos* (envy). The High Priests did not hand Him over for blasphemy, but for envy of His authority and His light which exposed their darkness. Pilate, a man of the world, discerns the worldly motive of the religious leaders.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
οι δε αρχϊερειϲ ανε τον οχλον ϊνα μαλλον τον βα απολυϲη αυ ˙

**English Translation**
But the High Priests stirred up the crowd so that rather Barabbas he might release to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful inversion of the priestly office. The priest is ordained to intercede for the people to God; here, they incite (*aneseisan*) the people against God. They prefer the murderer Barabbas—a man of blood—over the Blood of the Covenant. By choosing the violent revolutionary, they seal the fate of their city, which will eventually fall to the very violence they embrace here.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πειλατοϲ παλιν αποκριθειϲ ελεγεν αυτοιϲ · τι ο ποιηϲω ον λεγετε τον βαϲιλεα των ϊου ·

**English Translation**
But Pilate again answering was saying to them, "What therefore shall I do [to Him] whom you call the King of the Jews?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate attempts to wash his hands by transferring the sentence to the mob. "Whom *you* call" (*on legete*)—he distances himself, yet forces them to confront their own terminology. If they call Him King, how can they destroy Him? It is the question that echoes through the ages to every soul: "What will you do with the One called King?"

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
οι δε παλιν εκραξαν · ϲταυρωϲ αυτον ˙

**English Translation**
But they cried out again: "Crucify him!"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the madness of the multitude, captured here by the evangelist. The word *παλιν* (again) indicates a reiteration of malice; having rejected the Just One for the bandit, they now demand the specific mode of death. The scribe records *ϲταυρωϲ* (stauros) abruptly, an imperative demand echoing the brutality of the cross itself. It is not enough that he dies; he must be accursed. The voice of the people, often fickle, here becomes the voice of the adversary, demanding the destruction of the Life-giver.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πειλατοϲ ελεγεν αυτοιϲ · τι γαρ κακ εποιηϲεν ˙ οι δε περιϲ εκραξαν · λεγον ϲταυρωϲον αυτ ·

**English Translation**
But Pilate said to them: "For what evil did he do?" But they cried out exceedingly, saying: "Crucify him!"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate’s inquiry, *τι γαρ κακ* (for what evil), stands as a judicial testimony to the Lord’s innocence. The governor seeks a cause for death but finds none. Yet, reason is met with volume, not argument. The text notes they cried out *περιϲ* (exceedingly/more abundantly). Sin, having no defense, resorts to noise. The abbreviation *αυτ* (him) at the end shortens the object of their hate, as if they wish to dispense with him quickly. They do not answer the question of "what evil," for his only "evil" was exposing their darkness.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πειλατοϲ βουλομε ποιηϲαι το ϊκα τω οχλω απελυ αυτοιϲ τον βαραβ · και παρεδωκ τον φραγελλωϲαϲ ϊνα

**English Translation**
And Pilate, wishing to do the sufficient [thing] for the crowd, released to them Barabbas; and he handed over [Jesus], having scourged [him], that [he might be crucified].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the collapse of justice. Pilate acts *βουλομε* (wishing) not for truth, but to do *το ϊκα* (the sufficient/satisfying thing) for the mob. He trades the Son of God for a revolutionary. The scribe uses the Latinism *φραγελλωϲαϲ* (having scourged), marking the intrusion of Roman brutality upon the sacred body. The verse trails off with *ϊνα* (that/in order to), leaving the terrible purpose hanging in the air: the scourging is but the preparation for the unspoken horror of the cross.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ϲτρατιωται απη αυτον εϲω τηϲ αυληϲ · ο εϲτιν πραιτωριον και ϲ ολην > > ︴ την ϲπειραν

**English Translation**
And the soldiers led him away inside the courtyard, which is [the] Praetorium, and [call together] the whole cohort.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scene shifts from the public tribunal to the private quarters of violence, *εϲω τηϲ αυληϲ* (inside the courtyard). The text explicates this as the *πραιτωριον*. The gathering of the *ολην την ϲπειραν* (whole cohort) suggests a spectacle; the Lord is surrounded by a multitude of Gentiles, foreshadowing that while the Jews handed him over, the nations (represented by the cohort) are the ones who enact the suffering. He stands alone amidst the armed might of the world.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και αυτ αυτ πορφυραν και περι αυτω πλε ακανθιν ϲτεφανον

**English Translation**
And [they clothe] him [in] purple, and [place] around him, [having] plaited [it], a thorny crown.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates the action *αυτ αυτ* (likely *enduousin auton* - they dress him), rushing to the image. *Πορφυραν* (purple) mocks his Kingship, yet ironically confesses it. The *ακανθιν ϲτεφανον* (thorny crown) is the most profound symbol: the earth produced thorns because of Adam's sin (Genesis 3:18), and now the Second Adam bears that very curse upon His brow. He is crowned with the sins of the world, transforming the instrument of mockery into the diadem of redemption.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
και ηρ αϲπαζεϲθαι αυτον και λεγειν · χαιρε βαϲιλευ των ϊουδαιων

**English Translation**
And [they] began to salute him and to say: "Hail, King of the Jews."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They offer a salutation, *χαιρε* (Hail/Rejoice), which is customary for emperors, yet here dripping with venom. The title *βαϲιλευ των ϊουδαιων* is spoken in jest by the soldiers, yet it is the eternal truth. Even in their ignorance, the enemies of Christ are compelled to speak the truth of His identity. They think they are mocking a prisoner, but they are heralding the Sovereign of the cosmos.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και ετυπτον αυ> την κεφαλην καλαμω και ενε> αυτω · και > τιθεντεϲ τα γονα προϲεκυνουν αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And they were striking his head with a reed and [spitting] on him; and placing the knees, they were bowing down to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imperfect tense *ετυπτον* indicates repeated blows. The *καλαμω* (reed) is a fragile, mock scepter used to abuse the King. The text shows a lacuna where *eneptuon* (spitting) would be, yet the intent is clear. The physical posture *τιθεντεϲ τα γονα* (placing the knees) mimics the liturgy of adoration, but the heart is full of murder. It is a satanic inversion of worship: the creature mocks the Creator, bowing the knee in scorn rather than trembling.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και οτε ενεπαιξαν αυτω εξεδυϲαν αυ την πορφυ και ενεδυϲαν αυτον τα ϊδια ϊμα αυτου · και εξα αυτον ϊ> ϲταυρωϲωϲιν ·

**English Translation**
And when they [had] mocked him, they stripped him [of] the purple and clothed him [in] his own garments; and [they lead] him out that they might crucify [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mockery concludes, *οτε ενεπαιξαν*. They return *τα ϊδια ϊμα* (his own garments) to him. This is significant: he goes to the cross not in the costume of a stage-king, but in his own humble attire, recognizable to all as Jesus of Nazareth. The verb *εξα* (lead out) marks the beginning of the Via Dolorosa. The purpose is explicit and final: *ϊ ϲταυρωϲωϲιν* (that they might crucify). The theater of the Praetorium ends; the sacrifice of Golgotha begins.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και εγγαρευουϲιν αγγαρευουϲιν παραγοντα τινα ϲιμωνα κυρηναι ερχομενον > απ αγρου τον πα αλεξανδρου και ρουφου · ϊνα α τον ϲταυρον · αυτου

**English Translation**
And they compel—compel—a certain passerby, Simon [the] Cyrenian, coming from [the] field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that [he might take up] his cross.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript repeats *αγγαρευουϲιν* (they compel), a scribal error that inadvertently emphasizes the force used. Simon is a stranger, *κυρηναι* (Cyrenian), coming *απ αγρου* (from the field/country), unsuspecting of the divine appointment. The mention of his sons, Alexander and Rufus, suggests they became known believers. Here, the cross is shared; the Lord permits a man to carry the wood, showing that we must participate in His suffering. *Ινα α* (that he might take/lift) links the disciple's burden to the Master's instrument.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και φερουϲιν αυ επι τον γολ τοπον οπερ εϲτ εϲτ μεθερμηνευο κρανιου τοποϲ

**English Translation**
And they bring him to the Gol[gotha] place, which is—is—being interpreted, Place of a Skull.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They *φερουϲιν* (bear/bring) him, perhaps implying his physical exhaustion. The scribe abbreviates the Hebrew *γολ* (for Golgotha) and stammers with *εϲτ εϲτ* (is is). The interpretation *κρανιου τοποϲ* (Place of a Skull) sets the grim stage. Tradition holds this as the resting place of Adam’s skull; thus, the blood of the New Man flows down upon the dust of the Old Man, washing away the ancient death in the very place of death's dominion.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και εδιδουν αυτω εϲμυρνιϲμεν οινον · οϲ δε ουκ ε

**English Translation**
And they were giving him myrrhed wine; but he did not [take it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They offer a narcotic, *εϲμυρνιϲμεν οινον* (wine mingled with myrrh), intended to dull pain. The text is truncated at *ουκ ε* (did not [take]), but the refusal is absolute. The High Priest must offer the sacrifice with a clear mind. He drinks the cup of the Father’s wrath (Mark 14:36) to the dregs, and therefore refuses the cup of human alleviation. He embraces the full weight of the agony for our sake.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και ϲταυρωϲαντεϲ αυτον διαμεριζ τα ϊματια εαυ αυτου βαλλοντεϲ > κληρον επ αυτα ˙ τιϲ τι αρη

**English Translation**
And having crucified him, [they] divide his garments, casting a lot for them, who [should] take what.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act *ϲταυρωϲαντεϲ* (having crucified) is stated as a completed fact, almost incidentally, as the focus shifts to the soldiers' greed. They *διαμεριζ* (divide) his earthly coverings. This fulfills the Psalm: "They parted my garments among them." While the Lord offers his body for the life of the world, the world is concerned only with possessing his tunic. They gamble (*βαλλοντεϲ κληρον*) at the foot of the cross, blind to the treasure of salvation hanging above their heads.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ωρα τριτη · κ(αι) εϲταυρωϲαν αυ ˙

**English Translation**
And it was the third hour; and they crucified hi[m].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the brevity of the chronicler. There is no adornment in the horror, only the liturgical marking of time—the *third hour*—and the act itself. The scribe abbreviates the victim to *au* [him], as if the very name is too heavy to write in full amidst the wood and nails. The conjunction *kai* binds the time of day irrevocably to the deed; the sun climbs while the Son is fixed.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και ην η επιγραφη τηϲ αιτιαϲ αυτου επιγεγραμμενη · ο βαϲιλευϲ των ϊ ˙

**English Translation**
And the inscription of his accusation was inscribed: The King of the J[ews].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great irony written by pagan hands. The *aitia*—the cause, the legal charge—is truth itself. The text abbreviates the subjects, the *Ioudaion* [Jews], to a single iota (*ϊ*), perhaps diminishing those who rejected Him, or perhaps indicating that the title 'King' stands larger than the people who refused it. The inscription is passive (*epigegrammenē*), testifying silently above the silent Word.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και ϲυν αυτω ϲταυ δυο ληϲταϲ ενα εκ δεξιων κ(αι) ενα εξ ευωνυμ αυτου

**English Translation**
And with him they cruc[ify] two robbers, one on the right and one on his lef[t].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how He is numbered among the transgressors. The scribe shortens *staurousin* [they crucify] to *stau*, and *euōnymōn* [left] to *euōnym*, hastening through the arrangement of the condemned. There is a hierarchy of suffering here: one on the right, one on the left, but the Central Point defines their position. He is the axis upon which judgment—right and left—shall turn.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και οι παραπορευ εβλαϲφη αυτον κει ταϲ κε αυτων κ(αι) λεγοντεϲ · ουα ουα · ο καταλυων τον ναον και εν τρι ημεραιϲ οικο

**English Translation**
And those passing by were blasphe[ming] him, sha[king] their hea[ds] and saying: Wah! Wah! The one destroying the temple and in three days buil[ding] it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text captures the visceral scorn of the mob. The scribe abbreviates their motion (*kei* for *kinountes*) and their anatomy (*ke* for *kephalas*), mirroring the chaotic, disjointed nature of their mockery. The interjection *oua* is a raw sound of derision. They mock the prophecy of the Temple (*oiko* for *oikodomōn*), blind to the fact that the true Temple is being destroyed before their eyes to be raised in truth.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ϲωϲον > ϲεαυτον · κατα> απο του ϲταυ

**English Translation**
Save yourself, com[ing down] from the cros[s].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The temptation of the desert returns at the end. The text shows signs of struggle or correction (*kata>*), as if the command to "come down" (*katabas*) is an interruption of the divine plan. They demand he leave the *stau* [cross] to prove his power, not knowing that his power is proven by remaining upon it.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ομοιωϲ και οι αρ> εμπαιζ προϲ αλληλουϲ μετα των γραμ ελεγον · αλλουϲ εϲωϲεν εαυτον ου δυνα ϲωϲαι ·

**English Translation**
Likewise also the ch[ief priests] mocking to one another with the scri[bes] said: Others he saved; himself he cannot save.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The leaders of the people, the *archiereis* (abbreviated *ar*), speak a profound theological truth in their jest. They acknowledge his past works—"Others he saved"—yet their logic is earthbound. They believe inability (*ou dynamai*) binds him, whereas it is the bond of love that holds him. He *cannot* save himself, precisely because he wills to save the "others."

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ο ο βαϲιλευϲ ϊϲραηλ · καταβατω νυν απο του ϲταυρου · ϊνα ϊδωμεν και πιϲτευϲωμεν · και οι ϲυνεϲταυ ϲυν αυ ωνειδιζον αυ ·

**English Translation**
The [Christ] the King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And those crucif[ied] with him were reviling him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double article *o o* suggests a missing title, likely the *Christos* (Christ), emphasizing "The [Christ], The King." They demand sight to produce faith ("see and believe"), reversing the spiritual order where faith grants true sight. Even the fellow sufferers (*synestau* - those crucified with) join the chorus of reproach (*ōneidizon*), leaving Him in absolute, singular isolation.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και γενομενηϲ ω εκτηϲ ϲκοτοϲ εγενετο εφ ολην > την γην εωϲ ωραϲ ενατηϲ

**English Translation**
And when the sixth h[our] had come, darkness came over the whole earth until the ninth hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Creation responds where humanity fails. At the *sixth hour* (noon), the light of the world is extinguished, and *skotos* (darkness) reclaims the earth. The scribe notes the duration strictly: from sixth to ninth. This is not a momentary shadow but a sustained cosmic mourning, a suspension of the natural order while the Author of nature suffers.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
και τη ενατη ωρα > εβοηϲεν ο φω μεγαλη · ελωϊ ελωϊ λεμα ϲαβακτα ϲαβαχθανει · ο εϲτιν μεθερ · ο μου ο μου · ειϲ τι εκατελιπεϲ εγκατελιπεϲ με

**English Translation**
And at the ninth hour he cried out with a great voi[ce]: Eloi Eloi lema sabachthanei? Which is transla[ted]: My [God], my [God], for what have you forsaken me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text preserves the very breath of the Lord in Aramaic, then offers the Greek interpretation. Notice the scribal peculiarity: *o mou o mou* ("The of-me, The of-me")—the Nomina Sacra for God (*ΘΣ*) is seemingly elided or understood, leaving only the possessive cry. The correction from *ekatelipes* to *egkatelipes* intensifies the verb: not just "left," but "utterly abandoned in the deep." It is the cry of the Son tasting the ultimate distance of sin.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και τινεϲ των πα ακου ελεγον ˙ ϊδε ηλειαν φωνει ·

**English Translation**
And some of those stan[ding by], hea[ring], said: See, he calls Elijah.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tragedy of the deaf ear. Those *parestēkotōn* (standing by, abbreviated *pa*) hear the sound but miss the meaning. They mistake *Eloi* for *Elias* (Elijah). They look for the eschatological prophet to rescue the flesh, failing to see the Messiah offering the Spirit.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
δραμων δε τιϲ και γεμιϲαϲ ϲπογγον οξουϲ περιθειϲ κα εποτιζεν αυτον λεγων · α> ϊδωμεν · ει ερ> ηλειαϲ καθε αυτον ˙

**English Translation**
And someone running, and filling a sponge with vinegar, putting it around a re[ed], gave him a drink, saying: Le[t be], let us see if Elijah co[mes] to take him do[wn].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A confused act of mercy and malice. The sour wine (*oxous*) is offered on a *kalamos* (reed, abbreviated *ka*). The speaker says *aphes* (abbreviated *a>*), meaning "Let it be" or "Wait," suspending the moment to test a hypothesis: will Elijah come? They treat the dying Lord as a spectacle, a test case for their superstitions regarding the prophets.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
ο δε αφειϲ φων φων μεγαλην εξεπνευ ·

**English Translation**
But he, letting out a great voi[ce] voi[ce], expired.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text contains a stutter, a repetition: *phōn phōn* [voice voice]. Whether a scribal error or an unintended emphasis, it marks the magnitude of the final cry. He does not fade away; He *exepneusen*—He breathed out. The spirit is released by an act of will, a loud cry of victory amidst the defeat of death. The abbreviation *exepneu* cuts the verse short, just as His earthly life was cut short.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και το καταπεταϲμα του ναου εϲχιϲθη ειϲ δυο απο ανω> εωϲ κατω ·

**English Translation**
And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the end of the shadow and the beginning of the truth. The *katapetasma*, that heavy curtain guarding the Holy of Holies, is rent not by human hands, but by the divine force of the Son’s expiration. It is torn *apo anō* (from above), signifying that this judgment descends from Heaven. The separation between God and man is abolished; the mysteries of the old law are laid bare, for the true High Priest has offered the final sacrifice. The Temple of stone begins its dissolution, while the Temple of His Body prepares for glory.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ο κεντυρι ο παρεϲτηκωϲ εξ εναντιαϲ αυτου · οτι ουτωϲ εξεπνευ · ειπεν αληθωϲ ουτοϲ ο ανθρωποϲ · ϋϊοϲ ην

**English Translation**
But the centurion seeing, the one standing opposite him, that thus he expired, said: Truly this man was [the] Son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe how the Gentile sees what the Jew denies. The centurion stands *ex enantias*—face to face with the Cross. He does not merely see death; he sees the *manner* of it (*houtōs exepneu*). He witnesses a man who has power over His own spirit, laying it down of His own accord. The text here records his confession simply: *Huios ēn* (He was Son). Even without the full title, the soldier acknowledges a nature beyond the human. The Cross, meant for shame, becomes the pulpit of conversion for the nations.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε και γυναι> απο μακροθ θεωρουϲαι εν αιϲ και μαρια η μαγδα · και μαρια η ϊακωβου του μι> · και ϊωϲη ϊωϲητοϲ μη · και ϲαλωμη ·

**English Translation**
And there were also women looking on from afar, among whom [were] both Maria the Magdalene, and Maria the [mother] of Jacob the less, and of Joses Josetos [mother], and Salome.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Where are the disciples? They have fled. Yet the weaker sex is made strong by love. These women stand *apo makrothen* (from afar), kept back by the soldiers or by reverence, yet they do not abandon Him. The manuscript here preserves a peculiar naming—*Iōsē Iōsētos*—emphasizing the specific identity of the family. These names are recorded not for vanity, but as a legal chain of evidence; these are the eyewitnesses who will bridge the death to the resurrection.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
αι οτε ην εν τη γα> ηκολουθο αυτω · και διηκο> αυτω και αλλαι πολλαι αι ϲ αυτω ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα ·

**English Translation**
Who when he was in Galilee followed him and ministered to him, and many others who [came up] with him to Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True discipleship is defined here by two verbs: *ēkolouthoun* (they followed) and *diēkonoun* (they ministered). They gave of their substance to sustain the Creator of all things who became poor for our sake. The text notes "many others" (*allai pollai*), showing that the company of the Lord was vast, yet in this hour of darkness, it is the faithful service of these women that the Holy Spirit chooses to memorialize in the sacred page.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και ηδη οψειαϲ γε επει ην παραϲκευη ο ε> προϲαββατ ·

**English Translation**
And already evening having come, since it was Preparation, that is, Pre-Sabbath.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sun sets upon the Sabbath of the old creation. The Evangelist is careful to explain *Paraskeuē* as *Prosabbaton* (Pre-Sabbath), lest we miss the urgency. The Lord must rest in the tomb just as God rested on the seventh day. The law of the Sabbath, which He fulfilled, now dictates the haste of His burial. The shadows lengthen, and the true Sabbath rest is about to begin in the silence of the grave.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
ελθων ϊωϲηφ ο απο αρειμαθαιαϲ αρειμαθιαϲ αρειμαθαιαϲ ευϲχημων βου οϲ και αυτοϲ ην προϲδεχομε την βαϲιλει του τολμη · ειϲηλθεν προϲ τον πειλατον και ητηϲατο το ϲωμα του

**English Translation**
Joseph having come, the one from Arimathaea [Arimathias Arimathaias], prominent councillor, who also himself was awaiting the Kingdom of [God], having dared, entered into Pilate and asked for the body of [Jesus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the repetition in the text of *Arimathaias*—as if the scribe stammers over the sudden appearance of this secret disciple. Joseph is *euschēmōn* (prominent/noble), yet he risks his station. The text says *tolmēsas*—he "dared." To ask for the body of a condemned traitor was to invite accusation. Yet, he who "awaited the Kingdom" realized that the King was now a corpse upon a tree. His piety overcomes his fear; he claims the Body that the world rejected.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πειλατοϲ εθαυ · ει ηδη τε και προϲ τ κεντυριωνα επη αυτον · ει παλαι απεθαν

**English Translation**
But Pilate wondered if already he [was dead]; and having called the centurion asked him if he died long ago.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heathen judge marvels (*ethaumasen*). Crucifixion is a slow agony, yet the Lord laid down His life quickly, for He is the Master of life and death. He did not wait for the breaking of legs. Pilate seeks verification from the centurion; the state must confirm the death so that the Church may proclaim the Resurrection. The question *ei palai apethanen* (if he died long ago) underscores the unusual swiftness of the Lord's departure.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
και γνουϲ απο του κεντυριωνοϲ ε το πτω τω ϊωϲηφ

**English Translation**
And having known from the centurion, he [granted] the corpse to Joseph.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text uses a stark word here: *ptōma*—the fallen thing, the corpse. It is not merely *sōma* (body) but the wreckage of death. This refutes the Docetists who claim He only appeared to die. It was a true corpse, verified by the centurion, granted by the governor. Pilate gives it freely (*edōrēsato*, implied by the epsilon), perhaps out of pity or contempt, unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy that He would be with the rich in His death.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
και αγοραϲαϲ ϲινδο καθελων αυ ενειληϲεν τη ϲινδονι · και εθη> αυτον εν μνη ο ην λελατο εκ πε · και προϲεκυ λιθον μεγ επι την θυραν > του μνημειου

**English Translation**
And having bought a linen cloth, having taken him down, he wrapped [him] in the linen cloth; and placed him in a tomb which was hewn out of rock; and rolled a [great] stone against the door of the tomb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Every detail speaks of reverence. The *sindona* is bought fresh; the tomb is *lelatomēmenon ek petras* (hewn from rock), solid and new. He is wrapped and laid to rest. The rolling of the stone (*prosekylisen*) seals the narrative of the Passion. The "great" stone (indicated by *meg*) shuts the mouth of the grave, intended to keep the dead in and the living out. But rock cannot contain the Rock of Ages. He enters the earth to sanctify it, sleeping that He might awaken Adam.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
η δε μαρια η μαγδαληνη και μαρια η ϊωϲη εθεωρουν που τεθιται

**English Translation**
But Maria the Magdalene and Maria the [mother] of Joses were observing where he is laid.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The watch continues. The women do not depart until they see exactly *pou tetheitai* (where He is laid). Their gaze (*etheōroun*) is fixed and scrutinizing. Providence ordains this so that when the tomb is found empty, none may say they went to the wrong place. These silent sentinels of the Sabbath eve are the guarantors of the Easter morning. The chapter closes in the silence of the tomb, under the watchful eyes of the faithful.
