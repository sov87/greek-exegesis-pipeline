**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
εν εκειναιϲ ταιϲ η παλιν πολ οχλου οντοϲ και μη εχοντ τι φαγωϲιν προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ λε αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
In those days, again a great crowd being [present] and not having what they might eat, [calling] the disciples he says to them:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The recurrence of the "great crowd" testifies to the insatiable hunger of the world for the Word, a hunger that earthly sustenance cannot quell. The Lord does not act in isolation but calls the disciples, thereby teaching the Church that the care of the multitude is a communal burden, entrusted by the Head to His members.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ϲπλαγ επι τον οχλον οτι ηδη η τριϲ προϲμε μοι και ουκ ε τι φαγωϲ φαγωϲ ·

**English Translation**
I have compassion upon the crowd, because already three days they remain with me and have not what they might eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The compassion of the Savior is not merely an emotion but a response to perseverance; the "three days" signify a complete duration of testing and waiting. By remaining with Him despite their lack, the crowd demonstrates that the presence of God is preferred above bread, yet God in His mercy provides the bread also.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και εαν απολυϲω αυτουϲ νηϲτιϲ ει οικον αυτων εκ εν τη οδω και τινεϲ αυ απο μακροθ ηκαϲιν

**English Translation**
And if I release them fasting to their house, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from afar.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To return to one's "house"—the old manner of living—without the sustenance of grace is to risk spiritual collapse "on the way" of life. The Lord notes those who come "from afar," acknowledging the Gentiles and those distant from the covenant who have drawn near by faith, requiring strength for their return journey.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και απεκριθηϲαν οι μαθηται αυτου και ειπαν ποθ τουτουϲ δυνηϲετε τιϲ ωδε χορταϲαι αρτων επ ερημιαϲ ·

**English Translation**
And his disciples answered and said: From where will anyone be able to satisfy these here with loaves in a wilderness?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples see only the "wilderness," a place of desolation and scarcity, failing to recognize the Creator of sustenance standing before them. Their question "from where" betrays the limit of human reason, which measures abundance by earthly resources rather than divine power.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και ηρωτα αυτουϲ ποϲουϲ αρτουϲ τουϲ ε · οι δε ειπαν

**English Translation**
And he asked them: How many loaves [have ye]? But they said: [Seven].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He asks not for information, but to draw out a confession of their limited stock. By stating the number, they define the boundary of human provision, upon which the divine act will supervene; the silence of the text following "said" invites the faithful to supply the answer known to the church.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και παραγγελλι τω οχλω αναπεϲειν επι τηϲ γηϲ και λα τουϲ ε · · αρτουϲ ευχαριϲτηϲαϲ εκλα και εδιδου τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου ϊ παρατιθωϲιν και παρεθηκαν τω οχλω

**English Translation**
And he commands the crowd to recline upon the earth; and taking the [seven] loaves, having given thanks, he broke and gave to his disciples that they might set [them] before; and they set [them] before the crowd.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Order is established before the miracle; the crowd must "recline," ceasing their own labor to receive the gift. The bread passes from the Master to the disciples, and from disciples to the multitude, establishing the hierarchical flow of sacramental grace within the Church, where the priest distributes what he has first received from Christ.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και ειχ ειχ ϊχθυδια ολιγα και ευλογηϲαϲ αυτα πα ειπεν κ(αι) ταυτα παρατιθεναι

**English Translation**
And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he spoke [commanding] to set these also before.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the "few small" things are not despised but are brought under the blessing. The separate blessing of the fish emphasizes that every distinct gift of creation requires the sanctifying word of the Word-made-flesh to become spiritual food for the people.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και εφα παντεϲ και ε και ηραν τα περιϲϲευ κλαϲματων επτα ϲφυριδαϲ ·

**English Translation**
And they all ate and [were satisfied]; and they took up the abundance of fragments, seven baskets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The satisfaction is universal ("all ate"), yet the remnants exceed the original supply. The "seven baskets" symbolize the perfection of the Spirit's gifts remaining in the Church, ensuring that the grace of Christ is never exhausted by consumption but increases through distribution.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ηϲ ηϲ δε τετρακιϲχιλιοι · και απελυϲεν αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
Now they were four thousand; and he released them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The number "four thousand" encompasses the four corners of the earth, signifying the universality of the Gospel's nourishment. Having been fed, they are "released," not into abandonment, but sent forth into the world equipped with the strength derived from the heavenly meal.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ εμβαϲ ειϲ το πλοιον μετα τ μαθητων αυτου ηλθεν ο ειϲ τα μερη δαλμανουθα

**English Translation**
And immediately entering into the boat with his disciples, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord does not linger in the triumph of the miracle but moves "immediately" to new territories. Entering the boat with the disciples signifies the Church's journey through the tossing waves of the world, seeking out even the obscure places like Dalmanutha for potential harvest.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και εξηλθον οι φα και ηρξαν ϲυνζητειν αυτω ζητουντεϲ παρ αυ ϲημιον ϊδιν απο του ουρανου πιραζ αυτον

**English Translation**
And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with him, seeking from him a sign to see from heaven, tempting him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Those blinded by legalism seek a spectacle "from heaven" while ignoring the bread given on earth. Their "tempting" lies in dictating the terms of divine revelation, demanding a vision for the eyes rather than submitting to the sustenance already provided for the soul.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και αναϲτεναξαϲ τω αυτου λεγει · τι η γενεα αυτη ζητι ϲη αμην λεγω ει δοθηϲεται τη γενεα ταυτη ϲημι

**English Translation**
And groaning in his [spirit] he says: Why does this generation seek a sign? Amen I say, if a sign shall be given to this generation...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The groan arises from the depth of His spirit, mourning the hardness of heart that demands proof instead of offering faith. The abrupt cut "if a sign shall be given" serves as a divine oath of refusal; no sign is granted to skepticism save the sign of the prophet Jonah—the mystery of death and resurrection—which they cannot yet see.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και αφιϲ αυτουϲ πα εμβαϲ απηλθ ειϲ το περαν

**English Translation**
And leaving them, again having embarked, he departed to the other side.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He severs communion with the demanders of signs. By embarking again and departing to the other side, the Lord establishes a necessary distance between the skepticism of the faithless and the mysteries of the kingdom. This physical withdrawal signifies a spiritual judgment: where there is no soil for faith, the Sower withdraws His presence to the further shore.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και επελαθοντο λα αρτουϲ · και ει μη ενα αρτον ου ειχον μεθ εαυτ εν τω πλοιω

**English Translation**
And they forgot to take loaves; and except one loaf they did not have with themselves in the boat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The negligence of the disciples regarding material provision stands in stark contrast to the sufficiency present in their midst. They possess the one loaf, which is Christ Himself, the bread of life, yet their anxiety is fixed upon the plurality of absent bread. The text exposes the frailty of the human mind, which feels destitute even when the Creator of sustenance sits within the vessel.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και διετελλετο διεϲτελλετο αυ λεγων ορατε βλεπετε απο τηϲ ζυμηϲ των φαρι και τηϲ ζυ ηρωδου ˙

**English Translation**
And he was charging, charging them, saying: Watch, look out for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the command is marked by the repetition of His charge. He commands a dual vigilance: to watch and to look out. The leaven of the Pharisees is the corruption of religion through hypocrisy, while the leaven of Herod is the corruption of the state through secular power and vice. Both forces, though distinct, ferment the soul with the same malice, expanding silently until the whole lump of conscience is soured.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και διελογιζοντο προϲ αλληλουϲ ο αρτουϲ ουκ εχο ·

**English Translation**
And they were reasoning with one another [that] they have no loaves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Their discourse falls immediately from the spiritual to the carnal. While the Lord speaks of the dangerous doctrine and influence of the Pharisees and Herod, the disciples can only reason about the emptiness of their stomachs. This internal reasoning reveals a deafness to the allegorical nature of divine speech; they measure reality only by what they do not hold in their hands.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και γνουϲ ο λεγει αυτοιϲ τι διαλογι οτι αρτουϲ ου εχετε ουπω νο ουδε ϲυνϊετε πεπωρωμενην εχετε την καρδι καρδι υμων

**English Translation**
And knowing, he says to them: Why do you reason that you have no loaves? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Have you your heart, [your] heart hardened?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He rebukes the dullness of their inner faculties. The repetition of "heart" emphasizes that the seat of their understanding is calloused. It is not a failure of logic but a failure of the will and spirit. The hardening of the heart prevents the perception of divine power, trapping the soul in a cycle of anxiety over material lack despite constant exposure to the miraculous.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
οφθαλμουϲ εχον ου βλεπεται κ(αι) ωτα εχοντεϲ ου ακουετε και ου μνημονευετε

**English Translation**
Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Possessing the organs of sense does not guarantee the operation of sense. One may have eyes yet remain spiritually blind, and ears yet remain deaf to the Word. The Lord links this sensory failure directly to a failure of memory. To forget the past works of God is to blind oneself to His present capacity; memory is the treasury from which faith draws its sight.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ο τουϲ πεντε αρτουϲ εκλαϲα ειϲ τουϲ π και ποϲουϲ κοφινουϲ κλαϲματων πλη ηρατε · λεγουϲιν αυτω · ·

**English Translation**
When I broke the five loaves for the five [thousand], and how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? They say to him...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He interrogates them to force a confession of abundance. By recalling the breaking of the five loaves, He compels them to articulate the surplus that remained. The text here hangs in silence at their response, for the answer is known yet the act of speaking it is the necessary remedy for their unbelief. They must testify against their own anxiety by admitting the history of excess.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
οτε και τουϲ επτα αρ ειϲ τουϲ τετρακι ποϲων ϲπυ πληρωματα κλαϲματων ηρατε · και λεγουϲιν επτα

**English Translation**
When also the seven loaves for the four [thousand], the fillings of how many baskets of fragments did you take up? And they say: Seven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The specificity of the numbers serves as a catechism of providence. He distinguishes the second miracle, ensuring they do not conflate the works of God. Their response, "seven," is a self-condemnation; acknowledging the seven baskets of leftovers proves that they know the Lord can provide, yet they still reasoned about having no bread. Knowledge without application leaves the heart hardened.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ ου ϲυνϊετε

**English Translation**
And he was saying to them: Do you not understand?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question stands as a final indictment of their spiritual lethargy. It is not merely a query but a lament over the gap between revelation and comprehension. The evidence of the eyes and the memory of the baskets should have culminated in understanding, yet the disciples remain on the threshold, unable to grasp that He is the Bread of which there is no lack.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ερ ερχονται ειϲ βηθϲαϊδ βηθϲαϊδ και φερουϲιν αυτω τυφλον και παρα αυτον ϊ αυτου αψηται

**English Translation**
And they com— come into Bethsaida, Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and beseech him that he might touch him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters, repeating the arrival and the name of the place, reflecting the arduous nature of the journey. In Bethsaida, the house of fishing, they bring a man caught in darkness. The intercession of the community is paramount; the blind man cannot find the Light of the World on his own, but must be carried by the faith of those who beseech the Lord for a mere touch, knowing that contact with Holiness is the cure.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και επιλαβομενοϲ τηϲ χειροϲ του τυ εξηνεγκεν αυτον εξω τηϲ κω · και πτυϲαϲ ειϲ τα ομματα αυ επιθειϲ ταϲ χι αυτω επηρωτα αυτον ει τι βλεπει

**English Translation**
And taking hold of the hand of the blind man, he brought him outside the village; and having spit into his eyes, having laid [his] hands on him, he asked him if he sees anything.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Separation precedes salvation. He leads the man by the hand, establishing a personal covenant of trust, and removes him from the village to escape the tumult of the crowd. The use of spittle and the laying on of hands sanctifies the material world; the Creator uses the dust and moisture of the body to repair the body, showing that matter is an instrument of divine grace, not an obstacle to it.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και αναβλεψαϲ ειπ ελεγ βλεπω τουϲ ανουϲ οτι ωϲ δενδρα ορω περιπατουνταϲ ·

**English Translation**
And looking up he said, was saying: I see the men, for I see [them] as trees walking.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The restoration of sight arrives in stages. The man perceives motion and stature but lacks definition, confusing the form of men with trees. This signifies the gradual illumination of the catechumen; one first perceives the magnitude of spiritual realities before grasping their distinct nature. The Lord permits this imperfect vision to demonstrate that enlightenment is often a process of increasing clarity rather than an instant of total perfection.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ειτα παλιν επεθη ταϲ χιραϲ επι τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ αυτου και διεβλεψεν και απεκατεϲτη και ε ενεβλεπεν δηλαυγωϲ τηλαυγωϲ απαντα

**English Translation**
Then again he laid the hands upon his eyes, and he saw clearly, and was restored, and he looked upon clearly and far-shiningly all things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cure is enacted in stages to teach us that spiritual vision often clears gradually. The Lord lays hands a second time, restoring the man not merely to sight but to a "far-shining" gaze, enabling him to perceive the depth and distance of creation with distinctness, no longer confusing men with trees.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και απεϲτιλεν ειϲ οικον αυτον αυτον ειϲ τ οικον αυτου λεγων μη μηδε ειϲ την κωμην ειϲελθηϲ

**English Translation**
And he sent him into his house, saying: Do not, not even into the village, enter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He sends the healed man to his own home, forbidding entry into the village, for the grace of God is best guarded in the quiet of the domestic hearth rather than the tumult of the marketplace. Silence and withdrawal preserve the miracle from the idle curiosity of the crowds.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και εξηλθεν ὁ και οι μαθηται αυ ειϲ ταϲ κωμαϲ καιϲαριαϲ τηϲ φι και εν τη οδω επηρωτα τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου λε αυτουϲ αυτοιϲ αυτοιϲ · τινα με λεγουϲιν οι αν ειναι

**English Translation**
And he went out, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea of Philip; and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them: Whom do men say me to be?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He leads them out to the borders of the nations, near Caesarea, to question them on the road. He asks not for information, but to distinguish the confused rumors of "men"—who see only the human form—from the divine truth which his disciples are called to confess.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπαν αυτω λε οτι ϊωανν ϊωανν τον βαπτιϲτην κ(αι) αλλοι ηλειαν · αλλοι δε οτι ειϲ των προ

**English Translation**
And they said to him, saying that: John the Baptist, and others Elijah, but others that one of the prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world looks backward, unable to recognize the New; they see only the ghosts of the old covenant—John or Elijah. The crowd perceives the prophetic dignity in him but fails to grasp the singular authority that supersedes all who came before.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και αυτοϲ επηρωτα αυτουϲ · ϋμειϲ δε τι με λεγεται εινε ειναι αποκριθειϲ δε ο πε λεγει αυτω ϲυ ει ο ο του ·

**English Translation**
And he asked them: But you, whom do you say me to be? Answering, Peter says to him: You are the... the... of the...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter stands forth to speak the truth, yet the text here stammers with him—"You are the... the... of the..."—as if the magnitude of the title overwhelms the scribe's pen. He identifies the Lord as the One who belongs uniquely to the Divine, a confession that human language struggles to contain.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και επετιμηϲεν αυτοιϲ ϊνα μηδε λεγωϲιν περι αυτου

**English Translation**
And he rebuked them, that they should speak to no one concerning him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This truth is a sealed treasure, not to be scattered before the time of the Passion is complete. He commands strict silence, lest the proclamation of his glory precede the necessary reality of his suffering, leading the people to seek an earthly king rather than a crucified Savior.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και ηρξατο διδαϲκ αυτουϲ οτι δει τον του πολ παθειν και απο αποδοκιμαϲθηναι ϋπο των πρεϲβυτερ και των αρχϊερε και των γραμ και απο και με τρειϲ ημεραϲ α

**English Translation**
And he began to teach them that it is necessary for the... of the... to suffer much, and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to... and after three days to...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He unveils the hard necessity of the cross: the rejection by the very guardians of the law—the elders, priests, and scribes. The text abbreviates the rising, focusing our eyes on the suffering and rejection which must first occur, overturning all human expectation of messianic triumph.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και παρ τον λογον ε και προϲλαβομε αυτον ο πετροϲ ηρξατο επιτιμαν αυτω

**English Translation**
And openly the word he spoke. And taking him, Peter began to rebuke him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
When the word of suffering is spoken "openly," the carnal mind rebels. Peter, who just confessed him, now presumes to correct him, showing how quickly human presumption rises to oppose the divine plan of humiliation and death.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
ο δε επιϲτραφιϲ και ϊδων τουϲ μαθη αυτου επετιμη πετρω και λε ϋπαγε οπιϲω μου ϲατανα οτι ου φρονιϲ τα του αλ τα των

**English Translation**
But he, turning and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and says: Go behind me, Satan, because you do not mind the things of the... but the things of the...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord turns his back on the tempter, identifying the voice of Satan in the solicitude of his friend. Peter is ordered "behind"—to the place of a follower—because his mind is set on the things of men, shrinking from the things of God which demand the cross.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲα τον οχλ ϲυν τοιϲ μαθητεϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου ειπεν αυτοιϲ · ει τιϲ θελει οπιϲω μου ελθειν απαρ εαυτ και αρατω τον ϲταυ εαυτου και ακο μοι

**English Translation**
And calling the crowd with his disciples, he said to them: If any wills to come behind me, let him deny himself, and let him take his cross, and follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The summons is universal: both the crowd and the disciples must accept the same rule. To follow him is to carry the instrument of one's own execution; we must "deny" our very selves, treating our own will as a stranger, to walk the path of the Crucified.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ εαν θελη τ ψυχην αυτου ϲω απολεϲει αυτ οϲ δ αν απολεϲει την ψυχην αυτου ενεκεν εμου και του ευαγγελιου ϲω αυτην

**English Translation**
For whoever wills to save his soul will lose it; but whoever will lose his soul on account of me and the gospel will save it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the divine economy: to hoard one's life is to ensure its destruction, but to spend it freely for the Lord and the Gospel is to secure it eternally. Safety is found only in the surrender of all that the world calls secure.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
τι γαρ ωφελι α α κερδηϲαι τον κο ολον και ζη την ψυχην αυτου

**English Translation**
For what does it profit a... to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord weighs the entire cosmos against a single soul and declares the world light in the balance. To possess every created thing is absolute bankruptcy if the possessor is lost; the soul is the one treasure that, once forfeited, cannot be bought back.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
τι γαρ δοι δωι αν τηϲ ψυ αυτου

**English Translation**
For what might he give give for his soul?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see here the redundancy of the act, the stuttering of the heart before the magnitude of the loss. The text speaks of "give give," a double offering, yet even a repeated price is insufficient. For if a man possesses the whole world, he holds only dust; but the soul is breath of the Divine. To seek an exchange for the soul is to attempt to buy the infinite with the finite. There is no commodity in the marketplace of earth that weighs against the spirit; the question hangs unanswered because the answer is nothing.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ εαν επαιϲ με και τουϲ εμουϲ λογουϲ εν τη γενεα ταυτη τη μοιχαλιδι και α και ο του επαιϲχ αυτον ο ελθη εν τη δο του αυτου μετα των αγγελ των αγιων

**English Translation**
For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this generation the adulterous and sinful, also the [Son] of the [Man] is ashamed of him, he who comes in the glory of him with the holy angels.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrible reciprocity of shame. He who shrinks from the Word in the presence of an "adulterous and sinful" generation chooses the approval of the fleeting over the eternal. This generation is called adulterous because it has broken faith with its Creator, seeking pleasure in the creature. The penalty is exact: as the man turns his face from the Truth in the dust of this age, so the [Son] of the [Man]—the Judge—shall turn His face from that man when He arrives. The "glory of him" and the "holy angels" form a tribunal of light where no shadow of this sinful age can hide; there, the shame chosen on earth becomes the judgment endured in heaven.
