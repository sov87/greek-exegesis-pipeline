**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και ηλθον ηλθεν ειϲ το περαν τηϲ θαλαϲ ειϲ την χω των γεραϲην γεργεϲην

**English Translation**
And they came he came to the other side of the sea into the country of the Gerasenes Gergesenes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text preserves a movement from the plural company of the disciples to the singular action of the Lord, who arrives at this specific boundary. By naming the country of the Gerasenes and Gergesenes, the scripture identifies a distinct territory separated by the waters, a place where the authority of the Son of Man asserts itself over the lands of the Gentiles.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθοντοϲ αυ εκ του πλοιου ευθυϲ ϋπηντηϲ αυτω εκ των μνη α εν ακαθαρτω

**English Translation**
And him coming out of the boat immediately [there] met him out of the tombs a man in an unclean [spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no delay between the arrival of the Lord and the confrontation with darkness. As He steps forth from the vessel, the man comes out from the tombs, showing that the presence of life provokes the immediate reaction of that which dwells in death. The man is encompassed by the unclean spirit, defined not by his own nature but by the captivity in which he is held.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
οϲ τ τ κατοικηϲιν ειχ εν τοιϲ μνημαϲ και ουδε αλυϲεϲ ουκετι ουδειϲ ε αυτον δη

**English Translation**
Who had [his] dwelling in the tombs; and not even with chains no longer was anyone able to bind him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The wretchedness of his condition is total, for his home is among the dead rather than the living. The text emphasizes the failure of human restraint; neither iron nor force can contain the spiritual malice inhabiting him. It is a state beyond the help of men, where no one possesses the power to bind the evil except the One who has now arrived.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
δι δια το αυτον πολλα πεδαιϲ και α δεδεϲθαι και διεϲπαϲθαι ϋπ αυτου ταϲ αλυϲιϲ και ταϲ παιδαϲ ϲ ϲ και ου ϊϲχυϲεν αυτ δαμαϲαι

**English Translation**
Because of his often having been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains having been torn apart by him and the shackles smashed, and no one was strong enough to tame him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of binding and breaking reveals the futility of physical bonds against spiritual powers. The shackles are smashed and the chains torn asunder, demonstrating a strength that is unnatural. He remains untamed, much like a wild beast, waiting for the only authority that can command the spirit within to submit.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και δια παντοϲ νυ και ημεραϲ τοιϲ μνημαϲιν κ(αι) εν τοιϲ ορεϲιν κραζων και κατα εαυτον λιθοιϲ

**English Translation**
And continually night and day in the tombs and in the mountains crying out and [striking] against himself with stones.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The torment is unceasing, occupying both the darkness of night and the light of day. He wanders in desolate places, the mountains and the tombs, and turns his violence inward upon his own flesh with stones. This self-destruction manifests the ultimate desire of the enemy: the ruin of the image of God in man.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδων τον α μακροθεν ε και προϲ αυτω

**English Translation**
And seeing the [One] from afar he ran and [bowed] to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even from a distance, the spirit perceives the approach of the Lord. The act of running and bowing down is not one of voluntary piety but of compelled submission. In the presence of the Master, the chaos of the mountains gives way to a recognition of superior power.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και κραξαϲ φωνη μεγαλη λεγει τι ε και ϲοι υιε του του ϋψιϲτου ορ ϲε τον μη με βαϲανιϲηϲ

**English Translation**
And crying out with a loud voice he says: What have I to do with thee, Son of the God the Highest? I adjure thee by God, do not torment me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The unclean spirit confesses the theology that men often doubt, proclaiming Him the Son of the Highest. It interprets the proximity of holiness as torment. By adjuring the Lord by God, the demon attempts to use a formula of power, yet it only exposes its own terror of the judgment that stands before it.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτω εξελθε το το ακαθαρτον εκ του

**English Translation**
And he was saying to him: Come out, the spirit the unclean, out of the [man].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord does not negotiate but commands. The order to come out separates the usurper from the victim. By identifying it as the unclean spirit, He exposes its nature and mandates its departure from the human vessel it has defiled.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και επηρωτα αυτ τι ονομα ϲοι και λεγι αυτω λεγι λεγαι ονομα μοι οτι πολλοι εϲμεν

**English Translation**
And he asked him: What is thy name? And he says to him: Legion is my name, because we are many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question forces the hidden evil to manifest its identity. The reply 'Legion' indicates that the man is besieged not by a solitary force but by a multitude of enemies acting as one. The confession 'we are many' reveals the severity of the oppression which the Lord is about to conquer.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) παρεκαλει αυτον πολλα ϊνα μη αυ αποϲτιλη εξω τηϲ χωραϲ :

**English Translation**
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The spirits exhibit a fear of displacement, clinging to the specific region they have occupied. Their pleading acknowledges the Lord's absolute dominion over their location; they cannot remain nor depart without His permission, demonstrating that even the forces of hell are subject to His decree.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ην δε εκει προϲ τω ορι αγελη χοιρων με βοϲκομενη βοϲκομενων

**English Translation**
Now there was there near the mountain a great herd of swine feeding.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of the great herd of swine near the mountain marks the land as Gentile, outside the purity of the Law. These animals, unclean in themselves, stand ready to receive the unclean spirits, serving as a fitting receptacle for that which is being cast out of the man.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και παρεκαλεϲαν αυτον λεγοντεϲ πεμψον ημαϲ ειϲ τουϲ χοιρουϲ ϊνα ειϲ αυτουϲ ειϲελθω

**English Translation**
And they besought him saying: Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demons prefer the habitation of beasts to the abyss. Their petition to enter the swine confirms their need for a dwelling place, however base. They seek to flee from the man into the animals, showing that their power over the man is broken and they must now beg for a refuge among the swine.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και επετρε αυτοιϲ και εξελθοντα τα τα ακαθαρ ειϲηλθον ειϲ τουϲ χοιρουϲ και ωρμηϲεν η αγελη κατα του κρημνου ειϲ την θαλαϲϲ ωϲ διϲχιλιοι και ε εν τη θαλαϲϲη

**English Translation**
And he permitted them; and having come out, the unclean entered into the pigs; and the herd rushed down the steep place into the sea, about two thousand, and [were] in the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the authority which permits the movement of spirits, for the unclean cannot act without the license of the greater power. The herd, numbering two thousand, becomes the vessel for that which defiles, rushing violently down the steep place. Their end in the sea signifies the chaotic destruction that accompanies the presence of the unclean when unleashed upon creation.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και οι βο αυτουϲ · εφυγον και απηγ ειϲ την πο και ειϲ τουϲ α και εξηλθ ηλθ ιδειν τι εϲτιν το γεγονοϲ

**English Translation**
And those feeding them fled and reported to the city and to the fields; and they came out to see what is the thing that has happened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear drives the witnesses from their labor, scattering them to the city and the fields to bear tidings of the unnatural event. The flight of those feeding the herd results in the gathering of a greater witness, for human curiosity compels them to come out and behold the reality of the wonder. The report serves not to explain, but to summon the community to the site of divine intervention.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και ηρχοντο ερχονται ερχονται προϲ τον και θεωρου τον δαιμονιζο καθημε ϊματιϲμεν και ϲωφρονουν τον εϲχηκοτα τον λεγιωνα λεγαιωνα και ε

**English Translation**
And they come to the [one], and behold the demonized [one] sitting, clothed and being of sound mind, the [one] having had the legion, and [they were afraid].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The transformation of the man is absolute: where once was chaos, now there is the order of sitting, clothing, and a sound mind. He who harbored the multitude of the legion now rests in singular peace before the one who healed him. Yet, this restoration provokes fear in the onlookers, for the presence of such power is more terrifying to the worldly heart than the familiar violence of the demonized.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και διηγηϲαντο αυτοιϲ οι ϊδοντεϲ πωϲ εγενετο τω δαιμονιζομενω και περι των χοι ·

**English Translation**
And those having seen related to them how it happened to the demonized [one], and concerning the pigs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The narrative is twofold, binding the salvation of the man to the destruction of the herd. The eyewitnesses do not separate the healing of the demonized from the loss of the property, for the cost of this deliverance was visible and material. The testimony establishes the link between the spiritual liberation and the physical consequence observed in the swine.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και ηρξαντο παρακαλιν αυτ απελθιν απο τ οριων αυτων

**English Translation**
And they began to beg him to depart from their borders.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Confronted with the power that restores the soul but disrupts the temporal order, the people choose their borders over the presence of the healer. They do not respond with gratitude for the man's sanity but with a plea for separation. It is a rejection born of the desire to maintain the security of their territory rather than endure the unpredictable majesty of divine operation.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και εμβαινοντοϲ αυτου ειϲ το πλοι παρεκαλει αυτ ο δαιμονιϲθειϲ ϊ μετ αυτου η ῆ :

**English Translation**
And as he was embarking into the boat, the [one] having been demonized begged him that he might be with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The one formerly bound by torment now seeks to be bound by discipleship, desiring only to remain in the presence of his deliverer. His petition to enter the boat signifies a willingness to leave behind his native land which had rejected the healer. It is the natural response of the redeemed soul to cling to the source of its redemption.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ αφηκεν αυτον αλλα λεγει αυτω ϋπαγε ειϲ τ οικον ϲου προϲ τουϲ ϲουϲ και απαγγει αυτοιϲ οϲα ο πεποιηκεν ϲοι κ(αι) ηλεηϲεν ϲε

**English Translation**
And he did not permit him, but says to him: Go into your house to your own [people], and report to them as much as he has done for you and had mercy on you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Permission to follow is denied so that a mission to testify may be established; the man is sent back to his own house as a living monument of mercy. He is commanded to report not merely a cure, but the active doing of the benefactor and the pity shown. Thus, the domestic sphere becomes the first territory for the proclamation of the divine work.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και απηλθεν και ηρξατο κηρυϲϲε εν τη δεκαπολι ο εποιηϲεν αυ ο και παντεϲ εθαυμαζον

**English Translation**
And he departed and began to proclaim in the Decapolis [what] he did for him; and all were marveling.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Obedience expands the testimony beyond the house to the region of the Decapolis, turning a private command into a public proclamation. The man preaches the deed performed for him, and the fruit of this preaching is universal marvel. The one who was a terror to the region now becomes the herald of a wonder that captures the attention of all.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και διαπεραϲαν του εν τω πλοιω ειϲ το περ παλιν παλιν ειϲ το περ ϲυνηχθη ο πολυϲ επ αυτ και ην παρα την θαλαϲϲαν

**English Translation**
And he having crossed over in the boat to the other side again, again to the other side, a great [crowd] was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crossing returns him to the waiting multitude, for the hunger of the crowd draws them to the place of his arrival. Gathered by the sea, the people congregate around the center of authority. The repetition of movement underscores the tireless nature of his ministry, passing from rejection on one shore to reception on the other.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ερχεται ειϲ τ αρχϊϲυναγωγων ονοματι ϊαϊροϲ κ(αι) ϊδων αυτον πιπτι προϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ αυ

**English Translation**
And comes one of the synagogue rulers, by name Jairus; and seeing him, he falls at his feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Dignity bows before power as Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, adopts the posture of a servant. Seeing the one who heals, he abandons the standing of his office to fall at the feet of the master. This physical humiliation signals the depth of his need and his recognition of where true authority resides.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και παρακαλει αυτον πολλα λεγ οτι το θυγατριον μου εϲχατωϲ εχει ϊνα ελθων επιθηϲ ταϲ χιραϲ αυτη ϊνα ϲωθη και ζηϲη

**English Translation**
And he begs him much, saying that my little daughter is at the point of death, that having come you might lay hands on her, that she may be saved and live.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The father's plea is urgent and tender, speaking of his "little daughter" who stands at the very end of life. He connects the laying on of hands directly with salvation and life, showing a faith that the touch of the healer is the remedy for death itself. The request is specific: come, touch, that she may be saved.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και απηλθεν μετ αυ και ηκολουθι αυτω οχλοϲ πολυϲ και ϲυνεθλιβον αυτον

**English Translation**
And he departed with him; and a great crowd was following him, and they were pressing upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He responds immediately to the intercession, departing with the father into the throng. The great crowd not only follows but presses in, creating a scene of compression and urgency. In this crush of bodies, the singular mission to the dying girl proceeds amidst the heavy burden of the multitude.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και γυνη ουϲα εν ρυϲει αιματοϲ δω ετη

**English Translation**
And a woman being in a flow of blood twelve years.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text defines her existence by two bounds: the impurity of the "flow of blood" and the duration of "twelve years." She is not named, but identified solely by her suffering and her persistence in a state of living death, separated from the holy community by the law of Leviticus.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και πολ παθουϲα ϋπο πολλων ϊατρων και δαπανηϲαϲα τα παρ εαυτηϲ π και μηδεν ω αλλα μαλ ειϲ το χειρ ελθουϲα

**English Translation**
And having suffered many things under many physicians, and having spent all she had, and benefited nothing, but rather came to the worse.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the threefold failure of the world: the "many physicians" inflict suffering rather than cure; the wealth ("all she had") is exhausted without profit; and the condition itself moves "to the worse." Where human skill and resources end in futility, the necessity of divine intervention begins.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲα τα περι του ελ εν τω οχλω οπιθεν οπιϲθεν ηψατο του ϊματιου αυτου

**English Translation**
Having heard the things concerning the [One], in the crowd behind, behind, she touched his garment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition "behind, behind" emphasizes her extreme humility and desire to remain hidden. She approaches not face-to-face, but through the anonymous press of the "crowd," believing that contact with the mere exterior vestment ("his garment") of the Holy One suffices for power.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ελε γαρ οτι εαν α καν του ϊ αυτου ϲω

**English Translation**
For she said: That if I touch even his [garment], I shall be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Her faith is spoken internally ("for she said") before it is acted externally. The condition is minimal—"if I touch even"—but the expectation of salvation ("I shall be saved") is absolute. She seeks not merely healing, but salvation, recognizing the life latent in the holy vesture.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και ευ εξηρανθη η πηγη του αιματοϲ αυτηϲ και εγνω τω ϲωματι οτι ϊα απο τηϲ μαϲτι

**English Translation**
And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in the body that she was healed from the scourge.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The response of heaven is "immediately." The source of the defilement ("fountain") is not merely stopped but "dried up." This knowledge is not intellectual but somatic ("knew in the body"), a tangible liberation from the "scourge" that had tormented her.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ ο επι εν εαυτω την εξ αυτου δυ εξελθου επιϲτραφειϲ εν τω οχλω ελεγ τιϲ μου ηψατο τ ϊματιων ˙

**English Translation**
And immediately the [One], perceiving in himself the power having gone out of him, having turned in the crowd, said: Who touched my garments?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He is not a passive vessel; he "perceives in himself" the transaction of grace. The "power" is substantial, going out to the one who draws upon it by faith. He questions the "crowd" not for information, but to call the hidden beneficiary into the light.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγον αυτω οι μαθηται αυτου βλεπειϲ τον οχλ ϲυνθλιβοντα ϲε και λεγιϲ τιϲ μου ηψατο

**English Translation**
And his disciples said to him: You see the crowd pressing you, and you say: Who touched me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples judge by the senses ("you see the crowd"), unable to distinguish between the accidental pressure of the multitude and the deliberate touch of faith. They rebuke the Lord, failing to understand that spiritual contact is distinct from physical proximity.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και περιεβλε ϊδειν την του ποιηϲαϲαν

**English Translation**
And he looked around to see the [woman] having done this.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
His gaze ("looked around") is singular and searching. He does not look for the crowd, but specifically for "the [woman] having done this." Faith distinguishes the individual from the mass, and the Lord seeks the specific soul that has claimed his power.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
η δε γυνη φοβηθιϲα και τρεμουϲα και ϊδυϊα ο γεγονεν αυτη ηλθεν και προϲεπεϲεν αυ και ειπεν αυτω παϲαν την αληθι

**English Translation**
But the woman, having feared and trembling and knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and said to him all the truth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of the Divine elicits "fear and trembling," even in the healed. Her confession is total; she holds nothing back ("all the truth"). Healing leads to prostration ("fell down") and the public testimony of what "had happened to her."

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτη θυ η πιϲτιϲ ϲου ϲεϲωκεν ϲε ϋπα ειϲ ϊρηνην και ϊϲθι ϋγιηϲ απο τηϲ μαϲτιγοϲ ϲου

**English Translation**
And he said to her: Daughter, your faith has saved you; go into peace and be whole from your scourge.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He confers dignity with the title "Daughter," restoring her to the family of God. He identifies the instrument of the miracle as "your faith." The command grants a permanent state of "peace" and confirms the durability of the cure ("be whole") from the "scourge."

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ετι αυτου λαλουν ερχονται απο του αρχϊϲυναγωγου λεγοντεϲ οτι η θυ ϲου απεθαν απεθαν τι ετι ϲκυλλειϲ τον διδαϲκαλον

**English Translation**
While he was still speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue, saying that: Your daughter died, died; why do you still trouble the Teacher?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The message of death ("died, died") interrupts the word of life. The repetition emphasizes the finality of the event in human eyes. The messengers view the "Teacher" as useful only for the living, believing death places the girl beyond his reach ("why do you still trouble").

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
ο δε παρακαουϲαϲ παρακουϲαϲ ακουϲαϲ παρακουϲαϲ τον λογον λαλου · λεγει τω αρχϊϲυναγωγω μη φοβου μονον πιϲτευε

**English Translation**
But he, having ignored, ignored, heard, ignored the word being spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue: Do not fear, only believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reveals a deliberate act of the Lord to disregard ("ignored... heard... ignored") the report of death. He stands between the father and the despair of the messengers. He commands the "ruler of the synagogue" to reject the fear brought by the news and to hold fast to the single necessity: "only believe."

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ αφηκεν ου μετ αυτου ϲυνακολουθηϲαι ει μη τον πετρον και ϊακωβον και ϊωαννην τον αδελφον ϊα

**English Translation**
And he did not permit [anyone] to follow with him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He enforces a separation between the multitude and the chosen witnesses, permitting only three to behold the coming mystery. This restriction signifies that not all are sufficiently purified to gaze upon the conquest of death, but only those pillars of faith he has selected. The specific naming of the brother of James underlines the unity of this witness, binding the testimony within a trusted fraternity.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
και ερχονται ειϲ τ τ οικον του αρχϊϲυ και θε θορυβον και κλαιονταϲ και αλα πολλα ·

**English Translation**
And they come into the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and he beholds a tumult and [those] weeping and wailing much.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He enters the dwelling of the ruler of the synagogue, moving from the open crowd to the intimacy of domestic grief. The sight of the tumult and the loud wailing exposes the helplessness of the world in the face of death, where noise replaces hope. He observes this despair not to participate in it, but to confront the chaos that lacks faith.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲελθων λεγει αυτοιϲ τι θορυβειϲθε και κλαιετε το παι ουκ απεθα αλλα καθευδι ·

**English Translation**
And having entered, he says to them, "Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child has not died but sleeps."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He rebukes the disordered noise of the mourners, bringing a new definition to the state of the child. By asserting that she sleeps, he does not deny the reality of the body's condition but proclaims his authority to awaken her as easily as one wakes from slumber. Death is thus stripped of its finality in the presence of the one who commands life.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και κατεγελων αυ αυτοϲ δε εκβαλ εκβαλ πανταϲ παραλαμ τον του παιδιου και την και τουϲ μετ αυ και ειϲπορευ οπου ην το παι

**English Translation**
And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having cast out all, takes the [father] of the child and the [mother] and those with him, and enters where the child was.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mockery of the crowd serves only to disqualify them from witnessing the miracle, necessitating their expulsion. He retains only the parents and his own companions, creating a sanctuary of silence and faith around the child. This entrance into the place where she lay signifies the penetration of divine power into the very chamber of corruption.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και κρατηϲαϲ τηϲ χιροϲ του πε λεγει αυτη τα κουμʼ · ο εϲτ μεθερμηνευομε το κοραϲιον ϲοι λεγω εγειρε

**English Translation**
And having taken hold of the hand of the child, he says to her, "Talitha koum," which is, being interpreted, "Damsel, I say to thee, arise."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He establishes physical contact, grasping the hand to transmit life through his touch. The preservation of the precise words "Talitha koum" anchors the command in his own voice, while the interpretation "I say to thee" clarifies that the authority is inherent in him. He speaks not as a petitioner but as the Lord of the living and the dead.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ ανεϲτη ︴ το κοραϲιον και πε ην γαρ ω ωϲ ετων · · και εξε ευθυϲ εκ μεγαλη

**English Translation**
And immediately the damsel arose and walked; for she was about [twelve] years old. And they were amazed immediately with great amazement.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The response to his voice is instant, with the damsel not only rising but walking, proving the restoration is complete and vigorous. Her age is noted to confirm she had reached a time of life sufficient for walking, removing ambiguity. The great amazement that seizes the witnesses testifies to the undeniable nature of the work, which surpasses all human capability.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και διεϲτιλατο αυτοιϲ πολλα · ϊνα μηδιϲ γνω τουτο · και ειπ ειπ δοθηναι αυτη φα

**English Translation**
And he charged them much that no one should know this; and he said [that something] be given to her to eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He seals the miracle with a command for silence, guarding the holy act from the irreverent curiosity of the multitude he had cast out. The instruction to provide food demonstrates his care for the natural needs of the body he has restored. It stands as a final proof that she is truly alive, flesh and blood, and not a spirit or illusion.
