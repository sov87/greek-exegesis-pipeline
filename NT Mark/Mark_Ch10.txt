**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εκειθεν αναϲταϲ ερχεται ειϲ τα ορι τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ και περαν του ϊορδα και ϲυνπορευ παλιν οχλοι προϲ αυτον και ω ωϲ ειωθει παλιν ε αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And from there rising up he comes into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan; and journey together again crowds to him, and as he was accustomed again he taught them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the tireless motion of the Word, who rising up does not cease from His labor but enters the borders of Judea and crosses beyond the Jordan. The crowds, drawn by a divine hunger, journey together towards Him, proving that the sheep instinctively know the Shepherd. Observe that He teaches them "as he was accustomed," for instruction is the natural habit of the Savior, who feeds the soul before the body.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθοντεϲ οι φαριϲαιοι επη αυτον ει εξεϲτιν ανδρι γυ απολυϲαι πιραζοντεϲ αυτ

**English Translation**
And approaching, the Pharisees asked him if it is lawful for a man to release a wife, testing him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisees approach not with a desire for wisdom, but with the malice of a test, seeking to entrap the Truth in the nets of the law. They inquire about the lawfulness of releasing a wife, turning a matter of holy union into a legalistic dispute. Their question reveals their heart; they look for a loophole to dissolve what binds, whereas the Lord looks to that which unifies.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ειπεν αυτοιϲ τι ϋ ενετειλατο μω

**English Translation**
But answering he said to them, "What did Moses command you?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He does not immediately answer their test but redirects them to the foundation of their own authority, asking what Moses commanded. By invoking the commandment, He forces them to look into the mirror of the law they claim to uphold. He calls them to account for the statutes given to them, preparing to show how the letter has been used to obscure the spirit.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπαν επε μωϋϲηϲ βιβλιον αποϲτα γραψαι και απο

**English Translation**
And they said, "Moses permitted to write a scroll of standing-off and to release."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They seize upon the permission rather than the ideal, citing the "scroll of standing-off" or divorce. Their focus is on the mechanism of separation—the writing and the releasing—treating the dissolution of marriage as a mere administrative act allowed by Moses. They confuse a concession for sin with the will of the Creator.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ προϲ την ϲκληρο ϋμων ε την εντολην ταυτ

**English Translation**
But he said to them, "Toward your hardness of heart he wrote this commandment."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord strikes at the root of the permission, declaring that Moses wrote this commandment only "toward your hardness of heart." The law of divorce is not a gift of grace but a monument to human obstinacy. It exists because the heart has turned to stone, unable to sustain the charity and patience required for the indissoluble bond.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
απο δε αρχηϲ κτιϲε αρϲεν και θηλυ εποιηϲεν αυτουϲ ·

**English Translation**
But from the beginning of creation, male and female he made them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He sweeps away the later concessions of the law by returning to the "beginning of creation," where the divine design is pure and unmarred by hardness. In making them male and female, the Creator established a binary intended for unity, not separation. The nature of humanity itself, formed in the beginning, serves as the supreme law over any subsequent statute.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ενεκεν τουτου καταλιψι ανθρωπ τον αυτου και την αυτου

**English Translation**
On account of this, a man shall leave his [father] and his [mother].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The union of marriage requires a profound departure; "on account of this," a man must leave the closest of kin, the authors of his earthly being. This leaving is the prerequisite for the new cleaving, showing that the bond of the spouse supersedes even the blood of the parent. One cannot forge the new flesh without forsaking the old dependency.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και εϲονται οι δυο ειϲ ϲαρκα μιαν : ωϲτε ουκετι ειϲιν δυο αλλα ϲαρξ μια

**English Translation**
And the two shall be into one flesh; so that no longer are they two, but one flesh.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of divine arithmetic: the two become one flesh. They are no longer two distinct entities capable of simple division, but a single organism. To separate them is not to unlock a latch but to tear living flesh. The reality of this unity destroys the very possibility of "releasing," for one cannot release oneself from one's own body without death.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ο ουν ο ϲυνεζευ ανθρωποϲ μη χωριζετω

**English Translation**
What therefore the [One] yoked together, let man not separate.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The yoke of marriage is placed by a hand higher than human authority; it is the [One]—the Creator—who has yoked them. Therefore, man, who is lower, has no jurisdiction to break what the Higher has joined. To attempt separation is an act of rebellion against the divine action that bound the two into one.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲ την οικιαν παλιν οι μαθηται περι τουτων επη αυτον αυτοι̣ϲ̣

**English Translation**
And in the house again the disciples asked him concerning these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the disciples, removed from the Pharisees and within the privacy of the house, struggle to comprehend this high doctrine. They ask again concerning these things, revealing that the hardness of heart affects not only the legalists but also those who follow the Truth. They seek clarity on the rigor of this teaching, for the mind of man shrinks from the permanence of the divine bond.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ ο οϲ αν απολυϲη τ γυναικα αυτου κ(αι) γαμηϲη αλλην μοι επ αυτην

**English Translation**
And he says to them, "Whoever releases his wife and marries another commits adultery against her."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord closes the door on evasion: to release a wife and marry another is not a new beginning but a continuing sin of adultery against the first. The bond remains in the eyes of God, and thus the new union is a violation of the existing one. The "release" granted by men does not dissolve the reality of the one flesh.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και εαν αυτη απο τον ανδρα αυτηϲ γαμηϲη αλ · μοιχαται

**English Translation**
And if she releases her husband [and] marries another, she commits adultery.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The obligation of fidelity is mutual and absolute; if the woman initiates the release to marry another, she falls under the same judgment. There is no distinction in the spirit: the woman who leaves her husband to join another commits adultery, for the covenant made in the beginning binds both male and female with equal strength.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και προϲεφερον αυτω παιδια ϊνα αυτων αψηται · οι δε μαθηται επε αυτοιϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And they were bringing to him children that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The faithful instinct seeks contact with the Holy One, believing that even a touch conveys grace to the weak. The disciples, however, act as gatekeepers of a dignity they do not understand, assuming the Master is too great for the small. True holiness is not protected by exclusion but is revealed in accessibility.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ο ηγανα και ειπ αυτοιϲ αφετε τα παιδια ερχεϲθε προϲ με και μη κωλυετε αυτα τ τ γαρ τοιουτων ε η βαϲιλια του ·

**English Translation**
But seeing [this], he was indignant and said to them, Allow the children to come to me, and do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Indignation in the One who is usually gentle marks the severity of the error; to block the humble is to oppose the Divine will. The command to "allow" restores the right of access, declaring that the Kingdom belongs not to the mighty, but to those who possess the simplicity and dependence of a child.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋ οϲ αν μη δε την βαϲιλι του ωϲ πεδι παιδι ου μη ειϲελθη ειϲ αυτην

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of [God] as a child shall by no means enter into it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The solemn "Amen" establishes a necessary condition for salvation: reception must precede entrance. The Kingdom is not a prize seized by strength but a gift accepted with empty, open hands. One must descend to the humility of a child to ascend into the glory of the realm.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και εναγκαλιϲαμε αυτα κατευλο τιθειϲ ταϲ χιραϲ επ αυτα

**English Translation**
And having taken them in his arms, he blessed them, placing his hands upon them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He confirms his word with a physical embrace, demonstrating that his love enfolds the weak within his own strength. The laying on of hands acts as a seal of the blessing, transferring grace directly from the Source to the recipient.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και εκπο αυτου ειϲ οδον προϲδρα ειϲ και γονυ αυτον ε αυτον δι αγαθε τι ποιηϲω ϊνα ζω ζω αιωνιον κληρονο ˙

**English Translation**
And as he was going forth into the way, one ran up and kneeling before him asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The man’s haste and kneeling indicate urgency and reverence, yet his question betrays a transactional heart. He seeks eternal life as a wage to be earned by doing, rather than a heritage received by sonship. He recognizes the "Good Teacher" but has not yet perceived the Divine nature that validates the title.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω τι με λεγειϲ αγαθ ουδειϲ αγαθοϲ ει μη ειϲ ο

**English Translation**
But he said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He challenges the man not to deny His own goodness, but to define it correctly. By pointing to God as the sole standard of good, he forces the inquirer to realize that if this Teacher is truly Good, he is more than a mere man. The attribute cannot be separated from the Essence.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ταϲ εντολαϲ οιδαϲ μη φονευϲηϲ μη μοιχευϲηϲ μη κλεψηϲ μη ψευδομαρτυρηϲηϲ μη αποϲτερηϲηϲ τιμα τον π ϲου και την μητερα ϲου

**English Translation**
You know the commandments: Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and your mother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The citation of the Law focuses on duties toward the neighbor, the visible evidence of invisible piety. The inclusion of "do not defraud" speaks directly to the temptations of those with power and means. One cannot claim to love the Creator while exploiting His creation.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε εφη αυτω διδα ταυτα παν εφυλαξαμην εκ νεοτητοϲ μου ·

**English Translation**
But he said to him, Teacher, all these things I have guarded from my youth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The claim to have "guarded" the commandments reveals a life of defensive righteousness, keeping the letter without necessarily surrendering the heart. He presents his obedience as a completed resume, yet the very fact of his continued questioning shows that his soul remains unsatisfied.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εμβλεψαϲ αυ ηγαπηϲεν αυ και ειπεν αυ ετι εν ϲε ϋϲτερι ϋπαγε οϲα εχειϲ πωληϲον και δοϲ τοιϲ πτωχοιϲ και εξειϲ θηϲαυρον εν ουρανω και δευρο ακολουθι μοι

**English Translation**
And looking at him, he loved him and said to him, Still one thing is lacking for you: go, sell as much as you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gaze of love precedes the severity of the command; he demands everything because he offers everything. The "one thing" lacking is the total divestment of earthly reliance to make room for heavenly treasure. Following requires unburdened hands; one cannot hold the world and the Teacher simultaneously.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ϲτυγναϲαϲ επι τω λογω απηλθ λυπουμενοϲ γαρ εχων κτημα πολλα ·

**English Translation**
But he, becoming gloomy at the word, went away grieving, for he was having many possessions.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Grief is the fruit of a will that values the gift above the Giver. His "many possessions" have become his captors, dragging him away from the source of Life. He departs not in anger but in sorrow, for he sees the cost of freedom and chooses the slavery of gold.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και περι ο ελεγεν λεγει τοιϲ μαθη αυτου πωϲ δυ δυϲ οι τα χρη εχοντεϲ ειϲ την βαϲιλιαν του ειϲελευϲοντε

**English Translation**
And looking around, he says to his disciples, How hardly will those having riches enter into the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "looking around" implies a sweeping judgment upon the order of the world. Riches, often seen as a sign of blessing, are here revealed as a formidable obstruction. The abundance of means creates a scarcity of faith, for it is hard to rely on the Unseen when one is comforted by the seen.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
οι δε μαθηται εθαμ επι τοιϲ λο αυτου ο δε παλιν αποκρι λεγει αυτοιϲ τεκνα πωϲ δυϲκο εϲτιν ειϲ τ βαϲιλειαν του ειϲελθειν

**English Translation**
But the disciples were amazed at his words. But answering again he says to them, Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The amazement of the disciples exposes their worldly assumption that wealth equals spiritual status. Addressing them tenderly as "Children," he strips away this illusion, confirming that the path to the Kingdom is narrow and impassable to those swollen with earthly pride. Entrance requires a spiritual stripping that the world finds impossible.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ευκο εϲτιν καμηλον δια τρη τρυμαλιαϲ ραφιδοϲ ει η πλουϲι ειϲ την βαϲιλι του ειϲελθιν

**English Translation**
[It] is easier [for a] camel to enter through [the] hole, [the] hole of [a] needle, than [for a] wealthy [man] to enter into the kingdom of God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text emphasizes the narrowness of the passage by stating "hole" twice (`τρη τρυμαλιαϲ`), magnifying the impossibility for the great beast to pass. The wealthy man, burdened by the magnitude of his possessions, faces a barrier more impenetrable than the eye of a needle. Entrance into the kingdom of God (`βαϲιλι του`) requires a stripping away of bulk, which the rich find most difficult to endure.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
οι δε περιϲϲωϲ εξε λεγον προϲ αυτον κ(αι) τιϲ δυναται ϲωθη

**English Translation**
And those were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, And who is able to be saved?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reaction of the disciples is not merely surprise but excessive astonishment (`περιϲϲωϲ`). They perceive that if the wealthy, who possess the means of the world, are barred, then the standard for salvation is beyond human reach. Their question, "And who is able to be saved," acknowledges that salvation is not a matter of accumulation but of a power they do not yet comprehend.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
εμβλεψαϲ αυ ο ειπεν λεγι πα ανθρωποιϲ α αλλ ου παρα παντα γαρ δυνατα παρα τω

**English Translation**
Having looked at them Jesus said, he says, With men impossible, but not with God; for all things [are] possible with God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord’s gaze (`εμβλεψαϲ`) pierces their confusion before His voice speaks. He places the condition of humanity, where salvation is "impossible" (`α`), against the nature of God, with whom "all things" are possible. The repetition of "with God" (`παρα τω`) anchors hope not in human capacity or merit, but solely in the omnipotence of the Divine.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ηρξατο λεγιν ο πε αυτω ϊδου η αφηκαμεν παντα και ηκολου ϲοι τι α εϲται ημιν :

**English Translation**
Peter began to say to him, Behold, we left all things and followed you; what consequently will be for us?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter speaks as the representative of those who have made the total sacrifice, stating clearly, "we left all things." The query "what consequently will be for us" (`τι α εϲται ημιν`) seeks the logical conclusion of this abandonment. Having divested themselves of the world, they inquire about their status in the economy of grace.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο αμ λεγω ουδιϲ εϲτιν οϲ αφηκεν οικιαν η αδελφουϲ η αδελφαϲ η πατερα η μητερα η τεκνα η αγρουϲ ενεκεν εμου κ(αι) ενεκεν του ευαγ

**English Translation**
Jesus said to him, Amen I say, no one is who left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for the sake of me and for the sake of the gospel,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord validates the sacrifice with a solemn "Amen." He lists the specific attachments of earth—kinship and property—that bind the soul. The abandonment of these is not for its own sake, but strictly "for the sake of me and for the sake of the gospel." The motive sanctifies the loss, turning dispossession into an act of fidelity.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
εαν μη α εκατον νυν εν τω καιρω τουτω οικιαϲ κ(αι) αδελφουϲ κ(αι) αδελφαϲ κ(αι) μητερα κ(αι) τεκνα οικιαϲ κ(αι) αδελφουϲ κ(αι) αδελφαϲ κ(αι) μητερα κ(αι) κ(αι) τεκνα κ(αι) αγρουϲ μετα διωγμων και εν τω αιωνι τω ερχομενω ζω αιωνιον

**English Translation**
if he does not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mother and children—houses and brothers and sisters and mother and and children and fields—with persecutions, and in the age coming life eternal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise of "hundredfold" restoration occurs "now in this time." The text repeats the list of relations ("houses and brothers... houses and brothers"), emphasizing the overwhelming abundance of the spiritual family that replaces the physical one. Yet, this abundance is yoked "with persecutions," ensuring that the reward in this life is never separated from the cross, leading ultimately to "life eternal" in the age to come.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
πολλοι δε εϲονται πρωτοι εϲχατοι · κ(αι) εϲχατοι πρωτοι

**English Translation**
But many first will be last; and last first.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This maxim overturns the visible order. Those who are "first" in the estimation of the world, or even in the order of calling, may find themselves "last." Conversely, the "last"—those who have made themselves least for the sake of the Gospel—are elevated. It serves as a warning against presumption and a comfort to the humble.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε εν τη οδω αναβαινοντεϲ ει ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα και ην προαγων αυτουϲ ο και εθαμβουν οι δε ακολουθο εφοβουντο και παραλαβων πα τουϲ · · ηρξατο αυτοιϲ λεγιν τα μελλοντα αυτω ϲυμ

**English Translation**
And they were on the way going up into into Jerusalem, and Jesus was leading them, and they were amazed, and those following were afraid. And having taken again the [Twelve], he began to say to them the things about to happen to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The journey is marked by the double entry "into into Jerusalem" (`ει ειϲ`), stressing the finality of this ascent. Jesus walks ahead, creating a distance that generates amazement and fear in those following. He separates "the [Twelve]" (`τουϲ`) once more to speak of the suffering that will befall Him (`ϲυμ`), revealing that the path to the Kingdom leads directly through the passion.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
οτι ϊδου α ϊϲ ϊε και ο του α παραδο τοιϲ αρχι κ(αι) τοιϲ γραμματευϲιν και κατακρι αυτον θα και παραδω αυτον τοιϲ εθνεϲιν

**English Translation**
[saying] That behold, we go up into Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and will betray him to the Gentiles;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prediction is specific: the "Son of Man" (`ο του α`) is handed over first to the religious authority for condemnation (`κατακρι`), and then to the Gentiles. This dual betrayal involves both the sacred office (priests and scribes) and the secular power, encompassing all humanity in the rejection of the Son.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και εμ αυτω κ(αι) εμπτυουϲιν εμπτυϲουϲιν αυτω και μαϲτιγωϲου αυτον και απο · και με τριϲ ημεραϲ α

**English Translation**
and they will mock him and spit on—they will spit on him, and they will scourge him and kill [him]; and after three days he will rise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The degradation of the Lord is emphatic; the text stammers with the horror of it, stating twice that they will "spit on" Him (`εμπτυουϲιν εμπτυϲουϲιν`). The sequence moves from mockery to scourging to death (`απο`). Yet, the final word is not death, but the rising (`α`) after three days, indicating that the humiliation is the necessary prelude to the resurrection.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και παραπορευ προϲπορευ αυτω ϊακωβοϲ και ϊωαννηϲ οι υϊοι ζεβεδαιου λεγ αυτω διδαϲκα θελομεν · ϊνα ο εαν αιτηϲομεν ϲε ποιηϲηϲ ημιν

**English Translation**
And come near—approach him James and John the sons of Zebedee saying to him, Teacher, we wish that whatever we ask you, you do for us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sons of Zebedee make a determined advance, described by the text as both passing by and approaching (`παραπορευ προϲπορευ`). Their request is framed as a demand of will ("we wish"), asking for an open commitment from the Teacher before stating their terms. This reveals a desire to bend the Divine will to human ambition.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ τι θελεται με ποι ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ τι θελεται με ποι

**English Translation**
But he said to them, What do you wish me to do? But he said to them, What do you wish me to do?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord's response is recorded twice (`ο δε ειπεν...`), a textual doubling that echoes the intensity of His inquiry. He forces them to articulate their desire clearly. By asking "What do you wish me to do" repeatedly, He confronts the depth of their intent, making them speak their worldly ambition in the face of His impending passion.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπον αυτω δοϲ ημιν ινα ειϲ ϲου εκ δεξιων κ(αι) ειϲ ϲου εξ ευωνυ καθιϲωμ εν τη δοξη ϲου ˙

**English Translation**
And they said to him, Grant to us that one of yours on the right and one of yours on the left we might sit in your glory.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the thirst for dignity consumes them; they seek not merely proximity but possession, asking to be "one of yours" positioned in the high seats of authority. They perceive the glory, which they name, but they fail to discern the nature of the throne, imagining a kingdom of static positioning rather than active suffering. They ask to sit, yet the glory of which they speak is found only in the standing firm under the weight of the cross.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ ουκ οιδαται τι αι δυναϲθαι πιειν το ποτηρι ο εγω πινω · η το βα ο εγω βα βαπτι

**English Translation**
But he said to them, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or the ba[ptism] which I am ba[ptized] with?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord questions their capacity, revealing that their request is born of ignorance concerning the cost of redemption. The text itself seems to tremble at the mention of this immersion, stuttering "ba bapti," as if the very letters hesitate before the overwhelming reality of the passion. The cup is not of wine but of wrath and sorrow; the baptism is not merely of water but of a deluge of agony which He alone is sufficient to endure.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπ αυτω δυναμεθα ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ το ποτηριον ο ε πινω πιεϲθε και το βαπτιϲμα ο εγω βαπτιζομε βαπτιϲθηϲεϲθε

**English Translation**
And they said to him, We are able. And he said to them, The cup which I drink you shall drink; and the baptism with which I am baptized, you shall be baptized.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
With hasty confidence they claim power, saying "we are able," unaware that their ability comes only through the very grace they have yet to comprehend. He does not deny them the suffering, but prophesies their participation in it; for to drink His cup is to enter into the fellowship of His trials. The promise is not of the exemption from pain, but of the communion in the holy baptism of martyrdom and endurance.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
το δε καθιϲαι εκ δεξιων μου η ε ευωνυμων ου εϲτιν εμον δου αλλ οιϲ ητοι ϋπο του πα μου ϋπο του πατροϲ μου

**English Translation**
But to sit on my right or on [the] left is not mine to give, but to those for whom it has been prepared by my Fa[ther], by my Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He directs all authority regarding the eternal seating to the source of all paternity. The repetition "by my Fa[ther], by my Father" stands as a double seal upon the divine will, emphasizing that such honors are not distributed by favor or ambition, but by the preordained counsel of the Father. It serves to humble the aspirants, reminding them that the economy of heaven is fixed by a wisdom older than their desires.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και ακουϲ οι δεκα · ηρξαν αγανακτειν κ(αι) περι ϊακωβου και ϊωαννου

**English Translation**
And hearing [it], the ten began to be indignant concerning Jacob and John.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The fruit of ambition is immediate division; where two seek to rise, ten are moved to anger. The indignation of the ten reveals that they too harbored the same secret lust for preeminence, for we are most angered by the sins of others when they mirror the hidden desires of our own hearts. The unity of the apostolic band is fractured here by the name of Jacob and John, showing how quickly the bond of peace is severed by the pursuit of self-glory.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲαμε αυτουϲ ο λεγει αυτοιϲ οιδατε οτι οι δοκουντεϲ αρ των εθν εθν κατακυριευουϲιν αυτων και οι βαϲι κατεξουϲιαζου αυτων

**English Translation**
And calling them, he says to them, You know that those appearing to rule the nations, nations lord it over them, and the kings exercise authority over them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He summons them from their dispute to instruct them on the nature of true power. By repeating "nations, nations," the Lord emphasizes the ubiquity of this worldly pattern: a dominion that acts "down upon" its subjects. The rulers of this age rely on force and subjugation, a lordship that crushes the subordinate; this He sets as the dark contrast to the light of His own kingdom, where rule is not imposition but elevation of the other.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
ουχ ου δε εϲτιν εν ϋμ ϋμ αλλ οϲ αν θελη με γενεϲθαι εν υ εϲτω ϋμων διακονοϲ

**English Translation**
But it is not so among you, you; but whoever wishes to become great among you, let him be your servant.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The emphatic reduplication "among you, you" isolates the Church from the world, creating a sacred enclosure where the laws of pride are inverted. Within this body, greatness is redefined not as magnitude of status but as magnitude of service. The "diakonos" is the one who kicks up the dust in haste to serve; thus, the measure of a man's stature in God's eyes is the depth to which he is willing to stoop for his brethren.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ αν θελη εν υμιν ειναι πρωτοϲ εϲ παντων δου

**English Translation**
And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He advances the demand from servant to slave, from *diakonos* to *doulos*. To be first is not merely to help, but to belong wholly to the needs of others, forfeiting rights and claiming no ownership of oneself. This absolute surrender of the will is the gateway to primacy in the spiritual order; one commands the heights of heaven only by occupying the lowest place on earth.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
και γαρ ο του αν ουκ ηλθ διακονηθηναι αλλα διακονηϲαι και δουναι την ψυ αυτου λυτρον αντι πολλων ·

**English Translation**
For even the [Son] of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his soul [as] a ransom for many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the archetype of the new law: the Master becomes the minister. He does not merely give service, but gives His very soul, his *psychēn*, as the payment price to liberate the captives. The ransom is set "anti pollōn"—in the place of many—signifying a substitutionary exchange where the Holy One absorbs the debt of the multitude, establishing service as the ultimate expression of divine love.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
και ερχονται ειϲ ϊερι και εκπορευομε αυτου απο ϊε και των μαθητων αυτου και οχλου ϊκανου ο ϋϊοϲ τιμαιου βαρ τυφλοϲ και προϲαιτηϲ · ε παρα τ οδον ·

**English Translation**
And they come into Jericho. And as he was going out from Jericho, and his disciples and a sufficient crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bar, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They pass through Jericho, the city of the curse, now graced by the presence of the Blessing. We find a man defined by his lack—blind and begging—yet identified by his lineage, "son of Timaeus, Bar." He sits by the "hodos," the Way, unable to walk it but positioned to encounter Him who is the Way. His physical blindness signifies the condition of all who sit outside the light of Christ, waiting for the passing of the Merciful One.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
και ακουϲαϲ οτι ο ναζωραιοϲ εϲτιν ηρξατο κρα και λεγειν δ ι ελεηϲον με

**English Translation**
And hearing that it is the Nazarene, he began to cry out and to say, Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Hearing brings faith, and faith erupts in a cry. He identifies the "Nazarene" not by his earthly city merely, but by the royal title "Son of David," abbreviated in the sacred text to the letters of the King (`δ`) and the Savior (`ι`). He asks not for gold, though a beggar, but for mercy, the only currency that can purchase sight for the soul. He recognizes the hidden royalty beneath the humble appearance of the Nazarene.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
και επετιμ επετιμ αυτω πολλοι · ϊνα ϲιωπηϲη · ο δε πολ μαλλον εκρα ϋϊε ελεη με ·

**English Translation**
And many rebuked, rebuked him, that he might be silent; but he cried out much more, Son, have mercy on me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd, acting as the barrier to grace, repeats its rebuke, "epetim, epetim," trying to silence the desperate prayer. Yet the opposition of the world only fuels the fire of true supplication. He drops the title David and cries simply "Son," a piercing appeal to the filiation of the Lord. His persistence teaches us that we must shout over the noise of the multitude and the censures of men to reach the ear of God.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
και ϲταϲ ο ειπεν φωνη αυτον και φωνουϲι τον τυ λεγοντεϲ αυτω · θαρϲει εγει φωνει ϲε

**English Translation**
And standing, the [one] said: Call him. And they call the blind [man], saying to him: Take courage, rise, he calls thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord halts his journey to issue a command of mercy, thereby transforming the bystanders into messengers of hope. The summons "Call him" initiates the restoration, while the ministers of this call urge the sufferer to "take courage" and "rise." These imperatives rest entirely upon the divine invitation; it is because "he calls thee" that the soul finds the strength to stand and the confidence to approach.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποβαλων το ϊματιον αυτου α ηλ προϲ τον

**English Translation**
And he, having cast off his garment, ... came to the [one].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The casting off of the garment signifies the shedding of the old life and the removal of all impediments to grace. He does not delay to gather possessions or arrange his dress, but strips himself to move with urgency. His motion is directed solely "to the one," illustrating that the true destination of the enlightened soul is the person of the Master, approached in simplicity and without encumbrance.

**Verse 51**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ αυ ο ειπεν τι ϲοι θελειϲ ποιηϲω ο δε τυφλοϲ ειπ αυτω · ραββουνι ϊ αναβλεψω

**English Translation**
And answering [him], the [one] said: What to thee willest thou I should do? And the blind [man] said to him: Rabbouni, that I may see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation "What willest thou" dignifies the petitioner, soliciting his specific desire within the economy of salvation. By addressing him as "Rabbouni," the blind man confesses supreme authority. The prayer is not for alms or temporal gain, but strictly "that I may see," acknowledging that the restoration of vision is the primary gift of the Teacher, illuminating the darkness of the faithful.

**Verse 52**
**Greek Text**
ο δε κ(αι) ο ο δε ειπεν αυτω · η πιϲτιϲ ϲου ϲεϲωκεν ϲε · και ευθυϲ ανεβλεψ και ηκολουθει αυτω εν τη οδω

**English Translation**
But the... and the... but the [one] said to him: Thy faith has saved thee. And immediately he saw, and followed him in the way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Salvation is explicitly attributed to faith, which serves as the vessel for the reception of divine power. The healing is instantaneous, validating the internal disposition of the supplicant. The immediate consequence of this "saving" is discipleship: he no longer sits by the roadside but walks "in the way," following the one who is the source of his sight.
