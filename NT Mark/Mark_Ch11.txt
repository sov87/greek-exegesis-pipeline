**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και οτε εγγιζουϲ ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα ειϲ βηθφαγη · και ειϲ βηθανιαν προϲ το οροϲ των ελε αποϲτελλει δυο των μαθητων αυτου

**English Translation**
And when they draw near into Ierosolyma, into Bethphage, and into Bethania, toward the mountain of the olives, he sends two of his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The geographical progression into Ierosolyma through the lesser villages marks a deliberate ascent toward the seat of holiness. By positioning himself at the mountain of the olives, he prepares to confront the city not merely as a traveler, but as one initiating a divine decree from the high ground. The sending of the two signifies that the testimony of his coming is established by the lawful witness of pairs, binding the disciples to his will before the entry begins.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και λεγι αυ ϋπαγετε ειϲ την κωμην την κατεναντι ϋμ και ευθυϲ ειϲπορευ ειϲ αυτ αυτ ευρηϲετε πωλ δεδεμενον εφ ουδιϲ ανθρωπ ουπω εκαθιϲεν εκαθιϲ ˙ λυϲατε αυτον και φερετε

**English Translation**
And he says to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately entering into it [it] you will find a colt tied, on which no man not yet sat [sat]; loose him and bring.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command reveals absolute foreknowledge of hidden things, penetrating the village to locate what is bound. The duplication of "sat" in the text reinforces the absolute purity of this vessel; it is a creature entirely reserved for this specific burden, untouched by common use. To loose the colt is to liberate creation for the service of its Master, breaking the ties of the mundane to serve the sacred.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και εαν τιϲ ϋμιν ει τι ποιειτε του ειπατε οτι ο αυτου χριαν εχει · και ευθυϲ αυτον αποϲτελλει παλ ωδε

**English Translation**
And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? Say that the [Lord] has need of him; and immediately he sends him again here.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority of the "need" silences earthly ownership; the colt belongs ultimately to the one who created it. Yet, divine use does not equate to theft, for the promise is given that the creature is sent "again here." The Lord’s dominion serves a purpose that is both immediate and restorative, asserting rights over property while maintaining order among men.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και απηλθον και ευ τον πωλον δεδεμενον προϲ την θυραν εξω ε του αμφοδου · και λυουϲιν αυτ

**English Translation**
And they went away and found the colt tied at the door outside on the street; and they loose him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The location of the colt—outside on the street, at the door—places the act of unbinding in the public eye, not in secret. This loosening is a visible sign of the new dispensation, where that which was tethered at the threshold is now released to carry the King. Obedience is found in the precise correspondence between the word spoken on the mountain and the reality found in the street.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και τινεϲ των ε εϲτηκοτων ελεγον αυτοιϲ τι ποιειτε λυοντεϲ τον πωλον ·

**English Translation**
And some of those standing there were saying to them, What are you doing loosing the colt?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation by the bystanders represents the natural mind's inability to comprehend spiritual liberation. They see only the violation of custom or property, unaware that a higher law is in operation. The world always questions the loosening of that which it believes it possesses, demanding an account from those who serve the Spirit.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπον αυτοιϲ καθωϲ ειπεν ο και αφη αυτουϲ ·

**English Translation**
But they said to them just as the [one] said; and they permitted them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples offer no argument of their own but repeat verbatim the word given to them. It is this repetition of the Master's command that carries power, subduing the resistance of the crowd. When the church speaks only what she has been told to speak, the opposition of the world is rendered silent, and the way is opened.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και αγουϲιν φερουϲιν τον πω προϲ τον και επιβαλλουϲιν αυτων τα ϊματια αυτω αυτω τα ϊματια εαυτων και εκαθιϲ εκαθιϲ επ αυτον

**English Translation**
And they lead, they bring the colt to the [Jesus], and they cast their garments on him [on him], the garments of themselves, and he sat [he sat] upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The twofold action of leading and bringing, alongside the repeated casting of garments and repeated seating, emphasizes the solemnity and weight of this enthronement. The disciples strip themselves of their own coverings to adorn the beast, offering their dignity to provide a throne for the humble King. The text’s repetition underscores that this seating is the definitive act of assuming his royal trajectory.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και πολ τα ϊματια αυτ εϲτρωϲαν ειϲ την οδον · αλλοι δε ϲτι κοψαντεϲ εκ των αγρων

**English Translation**
And many spread their garments onto the way; and others layers, having cut [them] from the fields.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The earth itself and the possessions of men are laid prostrate before his advance. By spreading garments, the people confess their subjection; by cutting layers from the fields, they acknowledge that the fruit of the land belongs to him. The way is carpeted with the sacrifice of the faithful, preparing a path that separates the holy feet from the dust of the common road.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και οι προαγοντεϲ και οι ακολουθο εκραζον ωϲαν ευλογημενοϲ ο ερχομενοϲ εν ο ·

**English Translation**
And those going before and those following were crying out, Hosanna! Blessed is the coming one in the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chorus of voices from both front and rear signifies that he is the center of the faithful assembly, encompassing those who waited for him in the past and those who follow him now. They bless him who comes not in his own name, but in the name indicated by the sacred abbreviation, anchoring his arrival in the authority of the Divine.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ευλογη η ερχομενη βαϲιλεια του πατροϲ ημων ˙ ωϲ εν τοιϲ ϋψιϲτοιϲ

**English Translation**
Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father; Hosanna in the highest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The acclamation of the "kingdom of our father" bridges the earthly lineage with the heavenly paternity. The omission of a specific name here universalizes the fatherhood, pointing the faithful to the ancestral promise now fulfilled. The cry ascends to the "highest," linking the dust of the road with the throne of heaven, declaring that this kingdom is not merely terrestrial but cosmic in scope.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲηλθεν ϊϲ ϊε ειϲ το ϊ και περιβλε παντα οψε ηδη ουϲηϲ τηϲ ωραϲ εξηλθεν ειϲ βηθανιαν μετα των · ·

**English Translation**
And Jesus entered into Ierosolyma into the temple; and having looked around at all things, the hour already being late, he went out into Bethania with the [ones].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
His entry culminates not in a speech, but in a silent inspection of the temple. The "looking around at all things" suggests a judicial scrutiny, a measuring of the sanctuary against the standard of truth. That he withdraws to Bethania as the hour grows late indicates that the time of judgment is at hand, but the sentence is paused for the night, leaving the city under the weight of his silent gaze.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και τη ε εξελθ αυτων απο βηθανιαϲ επιναϲεν

**English Translation**
And on the next day, they having gone out from Bethania, he hungered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord of the temple, who the previous day inspected the house of God, now experiences the frailty of human need. His hunger is not merely physical but symbolic of his desire for fruit from his people. Coming from the place of rest, he seeks sustenance, demonstrating that the Incarnate One is fully man, subject to the gnawing of an empty stomach even as he holds the power to judge the nations.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και ϊ ϲυκην μι απο μακροθεν εχουϲαν φυλλα ηλθεν ει αρα τι ευ εν αυτη · και ελθων επ αυτ ουδεν ευρεν ει μη φυλλα ο γαρ καιροϲ ουκ ην ϲυκων ·

**English Translation**
And seeing a fig tree from afar having leaves he came if perhaps anything he will find in it; and coming upon it nothing he found except leaves; for the time was not of figs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the barrenness concealed by a flourishing appearance. The tree possesses leaves, signaling vitality and promising sustenance to the hungry, yet upon inspection, it offers nothing but foliage. The Lord approaches not in ignorance of the season, but to expose the deception of appearance without substance. He seeks fruit where there is a profession of life; finding none, the presence of leaves becomes a condemnation rather than an ornament. It is a severe admonition against those who bear the outward marks of sanctity yet lack the inward fruit of righteousness.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ει αυτη μηκε ειϲ τον αιωνα εκ ϲου μηδιϲ καρ φαγοι και ηκουον οι μα αυτου

**English Translation**
And answering he said to it, No longer into the age from thee no one fruit may eat; and his disciples were hearing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Word speaks to creation, and creation is bound by the decree. He does not cut the tree with an axe but strikes it with a sentence, showing that the power of the Creator operates through the utterance of judgment. "No longer into the age" signifies a permanent cessation; the tree that falsely signaled life is stripped of the capacity to produce life forever. The disciples hear this word, serving as witnesses that the authority of the Lord extends over nature, determining the fruitfulness or sterility of all things according to His will.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και ερχονται ϊϲ ειϲ ϊερο και ειϲελ ειϲ το ϊερον ηρξατο εκβαλλε τουϲ πωλουνταϲ και τουϲ αγοραζ εν τω ϊερω κ(αι) ταϲ τραπεζαϲ τ κολλυβιϲτων κα και ταϲ καθεδραϲ των πωλουντων ταϲ περιϲτεραϲ και ταϲ καθεδραϲ των πωλουντων ταϲ περιϲτεραϲ κατεϲτρεψεν

**English Translation**
And they come, Jesus, into the temple; and entering into the temple he began to cast out those selling and those buying in the temple and the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those selling the doves and the seats of those selling the doves he overturned.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Zeal for the house of God consumes Him. He enters the holy place and finds it cluttered with commerce. He casts out both buyer and seller, for the trade of holy things profanes the sanctuary. The text emphatically doubles the overturning of the seats of those selling doves, repeating the action to signify the thoroughness and intensity of His purification. He leaves nothing standing that converts the worship of God into a marketplace; the redundancy of the description mirrors the relentless overturning of every seat that supports this impiety.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και ου ηφιεν ϊνα τιϲ δι ϲκευοϲ δια του ϊερου

**English Translation**
And he did not allow that anyone carry a vessel through the temple.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He restores the reverence due to the sacred precinct by halting the common traffic of the city. The temple is not a thoroughfare for the convenience of men, nor a path for carrying burdens of utility. By forbidding the transport of vessels, He marks the boundaries of the holy space; what is set apart for God must not be trodden down by the mundane business of the world. The silence of activity is enforced so that the voice of prayer may be heard.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και εδιδαϲκεν και ε αυτοιϲ · ου γε οτι ο οικοϲ μου οικοϲ προϲευ κληθηϲεται παϲιν τοιϲ εθνε · ϋμειϲ δε εποι αυτον ϲπη ληϲτων

**English Translation**
And he was teaching and saying to them: Is it not written that my house a house of prayer shall be called for all the nations? But ye made it a cave of robbers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He reclaims the ancient promise: the house is not merely for a tribe but for all the nations, a universal center for supplication. By defining the temple as a house of prayer, He identifies its true function, which is spiritual communion with God. In contrast, He condemns the current occupants for transforming this sanctuary into a "cave of robbers," a hiding place where thieves feel secure in their crimes. They have retreated into the holy place not to repent, but to find cover for their avarice.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και ηκουϲαν οι αρ και οι γραμ και εζητο πωϲ αυτον απο εφοβο γαρ αυτον παϲ γαρ ο οχλοϲ εξε επι τη διδαχη αυτου

**English Translation**
And the chief priests and the scribes heard and were seeking how him they might destroy; for they feared him, for all the crowd was astonished at his teaching.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reaction to truth is division: the crowd is astonished, but the leaders are murderous. The chief priests and scribes do not seek to answer His doctrine but to destroy His person. Their murderous intent arises from fear, for His authority threatens their dominion. They see the multitude captivated by His teaching, and realizing they cannot control the Spirit that speaks through Him, they conspire to silence the Voice that exposes their robbery.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και οταν οψε εγε εξεπορευ εξω τηϲ πο

**English Translation**
And when late it became, they went out outside the city.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He withdraws when the day's work is done. He does not entrust Himself to the city by night, for it is a place of plots and commerce. By going out, He separates the holy fellowship of His disciples from the corruption He has just condemned. It is a rhythm of confrontation and retreat; He purifies the temple by day but refuses to dwell within the walls of a city that rejects the peace of God.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και παρε πρωι και παραπορευομενοι πρωϊ ϊδον την ϲυ εξηραμμε εκ ριζων

**English Translation**
And passing by in the morning and passing by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered from roots.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The morning reveals the efficacy of the evening's curse. The text emphasizes their passing by, noting the movement that brings the judgment into view. The tree is not merely stripped of leaves but withered from the roots; the source of its life has been dried up. This signifies a total judgment upon the hypocritical nature: when God withdraws His favor, the very foundation of existence crumbles, and the destruction is total, leaving no hope of recovery.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και αναμνηϲθιϲ ο πετροϲ λεγει αυ ραββει ειδε η ϲυκη ην κατη εξηρανται

**English Translation**
And Peter remembering says to him: Rabbi, look, the fig tree which thou cursed is withered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter recalls the word spoken and connects it to the visible reality. He addresses Him as Rabbi, acknowledging the authority of the Teacher whose lessons are written in the physical world. The astonishment lies in the speed and totality of the withering. Peter acts as the observer for the church, noting that the word of the Lord does not return void but accomplishes the judgment it was sent to perform.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο λεγει αυτοιϲ ει εχετε πιϲτιν

**English Translation**
And answering he says to them: If ye have faith.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He turns their attention from the spectacle of the withered tree to the internal condition of their souls. The phrase "If ye have faith" stands as a challenge and a prerequisite. He does not explain the mechanics of the miracle but points to the faculty of faith as the instrument of power. It is a conditional opening to the promise that follows, grounding all spiritual authority in the possession of trust in God.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω υμιν οϲ αν ειπη τω ο τουτω αρθητι και βληθητι ειϲ την θαλαϲϲαν και μη διακριθη εν τη καρδια αυτου αλλα πιϲτευη οτι ο λαλει γινεται ε εϲ αυτω

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be cast into the sea, and doubts not in his heart but believes that what he speaks happens, it shall be to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the domination of the spiritual over the material. The mountain, a symbol of immovable solidity, is subject to the command of faith. The requirement is absolute singleness of heart: one must not doubt. The power is not in the mountain to move, but in the believer who speaks with the certainty that his word is effective. Believing that "what he speaks happens" aligns the human utterance with the creative power of God, making the impossible obedient to the servant of the Lord.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
δια τουτο λεγω ϋ παντα οϲα προϲευχεϲθε και αιτιϲθε πιϲτευ οτι ελαβετε και εϲτε υμιν :

**English Translation**
Therefore I say to you, all things as many as ye pray and ask, believe that ye received, and it shall be to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The law of prayer is established: reception depends on the assurance of possession. He instructs them to believe they "received" (past tense) even while they ask, and the result "shall be" (future tense). This collapses the time between petition and provision. Faith is the substance of the thing hoped for; to ask without believing one has received is to doubt the Giver. The certainty of the grant must exist in the heart before the manifestation appears in the world.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και οταν ϲτητε προ αφι ει τι εχεται κατα τινοϲ ϊνα κ(αι) ο πατηρ ϋμων ο εν τοιϲ ουρανοιϲ αφη υμιν τα πα

**English Translation**
And when you stand before forgive if you have anything against anyone, so that also your Father who is in the heavens may forgive you the t[respasses].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The posture of prayer is described as a standing *before*, a confrontation with the divine presence that necessitates an immediate release of debts. The command to "forgive" is wedged directly against this standing, implying that one cannot remain in the presence of the Father while holding "anything against anyone." The text abruptly ends the promise of the Father's action at "the t[respasses]," indicating that the very things we hold onto are the specific burdens the Father intends to loose, provided we first release our brother.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και ερχονται παλ ϊϲ ειϲ ειϲ ιεροϲολυμα κ(αι) εν τω ϊερω περι αυτου ερχονται προϲ αυ οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι γραμματιϲ και οι πρεϲβυτεροι

**English Translation**
And they come again J[esus] into into Jerusalem and in the temple concerning him come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The movement of the Lord is emphatic, marked by a doubled entry "into into Jerusalem," signaling a penetration into the very heart of the city and its sacred precinct. While he is "in the temple," the religious authorities do not merely walk with him but gather "concerning him," encircling the source of their agitation. The confluence of the chief priests, scribes, and elders represents the totality of the old order converging upon the One who has entered their domain with finality.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγον αυτω εν ποια εξουϲια ταυτα ποιειϲ η τιϲ ϲοι εδωκεν την εξουϲιαν ταυτην ϊνα ταυτα ποιηϲ

**English Translation**
And they were saying to him: By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority that you should do these things?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation seeks to bifurcate the divine power into two earthly categories: inherent right or delegated permission. By asking "who gave," they attempt to subordinate his "authority" to a human or institutional source, unable to conceive of an authority that is not derived from their own Sanhedrin. They fixate on "these things"—his cleansing of the temple and teaching—demanding a credential for the power that manifestly disrupts their administration.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ επερωτηϲω ϋ καγω ενα λο και αποκρι μοι και καγω ερω υμιν ϋμιν εν ποια ε ταυτα ποιω

**English Translation**
But he said to them: I will ask you—even I—one w[ord], and answer me, and I also will say to you to you by what a[uthority] I do these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord dismantles their complex trap with a singular demand: "one w[ord]." He binds his answer to their capacity for truth, emphasizing the personal confrontation with the doubled address "to you to you." This repetition pierces their corporate defense, forcing them to stand individually accountable before the Truth. He does not evade but conditions the revelation of his "a[uthority]" upon their willingness to engage with the prophetic reality already presented to them.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
το βαπτιϲμα το ϊ ποθεν ην · εξ ουρανου η εξ ανθρωπων α μοι ·

**English Translation**
The baptism the [of] J[ohn] from where was it? From heaven or from men? A[nswer] me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question cuts to the root of spiritual discernment: the origin of the baptism of J[ohn]. By contrasting "from heaven" with "from men," the Lord forces a decision between divine initiative and human invention. The abrupt command "A[nswer] me" strips away their ability to equivocate, demanding a verdict on the forerunner that will inevitably judge their stance toward the Messiah.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) προϲελογιζοντο προϲ προϲελογιζοντο δι διελογιζοντο προϲ εαυτουϲ λεγ εαν ειπωμ εξ ουρανου ερει δι τι ουν ουκ επι αυτω

**English Translation**
And they were reasoning to... reasoning... reasoning to themselves saying: If we say, From heaven, he will say: Why then did you not be[lieve] him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text exposes the fractured mind of the unbeliever through the stammering repetition of their "reasoning." They do not seek truth but calculate consequences. Their internal dialogue reveals their guilt; they know that acknowledging a work "from heaven" necessitates the obedience of faith. Their fear is not of falsehood, but of the indictment inherent in the question: "Why then did you not be[lieve]?"

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
αλλα ειπωμεν ε · εφοβο τον οχλον π απαντεϲ γαρ ειχον τον ϊωαννην οντωϲ οτι προ ην ·

**English Translation**
But should we say f[rom men]? They feared the crowd; for all held John really that he was a pro[phet].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the paralysis of false shepherds. They cannot declare their true opinion—that the work was "f[rom men]"—because they are enslaved by the fear of the "crowd." The consensus of the faithful, who held John as a "pro[phet]," binds the tongues of the rulers. They are trapped between the truth of God, which they reject, and the opinion of the people, which they dread.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και απο τω λεγουϲιν ουκ οιδα και ο λεγι αυτοιϲ ουδε εγω λεγω ϋμιν εν ποι εξουϲια ταυτα ποι

**English Translation**
And answering the [Jesus] they say: I know not. And the [Jesus] says to them: Neither do I tell you by wh[at] authority I do these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The corporate body of elders speaks with a singular, ignorant voice: "I know not." This feigned ignorance acts as a seal against revelation. The Lord mirrors their refusal; because they have rejected the witness of the servant John, they are incapacitated to receive the witness of the Son. He withholds the knowledge of "wh[at] authority" he possesses, not to hide the light, but because their eyes are willfully shut.
