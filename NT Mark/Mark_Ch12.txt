**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και ηρξατο αυτοιϲ παραβολαιϲ λαλ αμπελωνα ανθρω εφυτευϲεν κ(αι) περιεθηκεν φρα και ωρυξεν ϋποληνιον και ωκοδομηϲεν πυρ και εξεδετο αυ γεωργοιϲ και απεδημηϲεν

**English Translation**
And he began to speak to them in parables: A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a vat and built a tower and gave it out to farmers and went abroad.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The man acts with complete deliberation and provision. He does not merely plant; he establishes a protected and functional order—the fence for defense, the vat for processing, and the tower for vigilance. By giving it out to farmers and going abroad, he demonstrates that stewardship requires freedom; the farmers are entrusted with a fully prepared work, and the absence of the owner is the test of their fidelity to the structure he established.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) απεϲτιλεν προϲ τουϲ γεωργουϲ τω καιρω δουλον ϊνα παρα των γεωργ λαβοι λαβη απο των καρ του αμπελω

**English Translation**
And he sent to the farmers at the season a slave, that from the farmers he might receive from the fruits of the vineyard.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sending of the slave occurs "at the season," indicating that the owner respects the natural order of time and harvest. The demand is not for the vineyard itself, which remains the farmers' charge, but for the "fruits" which are the rightful return on the owner’s investment. The slave serves as the lawful connector between the distant lord and the laboring farmers.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και λαβοντεϲ αυτον εδειραν και απεϲτιλαν καιν

**English Translation**
And taking him they beat him and sent him away empty.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the farmers enact their first refusal. To send the messenger away "empty" is to deny the debt they owe to the one who planted. The violence of beating signifies that they view the claim of authority as an aggression against themselves. They return nothing but injury to the source of their provision.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και παλιν απεϲτι προϲ αυτουϲ αλ αλλον δο αλλον δουλον κακεινον ε και ητιμαϲαν

**English Translation**
And again he sent to them another, another slave; and that one [they wounded] and dishonored.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "another, another" underscores the persistence of the owner’s patience against the escalation of the farmers' insolence. They do not stop at physical violence but proceed to "dishonor," striking at the dignity of the sender through his representative. The text reveals a hardening of will; the more the owner appeals, the more shameful the farmers’ response becomes.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και αλ απεϲτιλεν κα απεκτιν και πολλουϲ ολλουϲ αλλουϲ αλλουϲ ουϲ μεν δεροντεϲ ουϲ δε αποκτενν αποκτινν

**English Translation**
And another he sent, and they killed; and many others, some beating, and others killing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Rebellion matures into death. The chaotic listing of "many others" and the mixture of "beating" and "killing" depicts a tyranny of disorder within the vineyard. The farmers answer the abundance of messengers with an abundance of violence, proving that their rejection is total and systematic, not merely a momentary lapse.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ετι ενα ειχεν αγαπητον απε αυτον εϲχα προϲ αυτουϲ λε · οτι εντραπη τον μου ·

**English Translation**
Still he had one beloved; he sent him last to them, saying: They will reverence my [son].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The shift from "slave" to "one beloved" marks the ultimate risk of the owner. Sending him "last" signifies that there are no further appeals; this is the final measure of the farmers' hearts. The expectation that they will "reverence" him assumes that the presence of the beloved will awaken a dormant conscience, distinguishing the heir from the servants.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
εκινοι δε οι γεωρ προϲ εαυτουϲ ει οτι ουτοϲ εϲτ εϲτ ο κληρονομοϲ δευ αποκτινωμεν αυτον και ημων εϲτε η κληρονομια

**English Translation**
But those farmers said to themselves that: This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and ours shall be the inheritance.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The farmers possess clear knowledge; they identify exactly "who" acts as the heir. Their sin is calculated usurpation. By conspiring "to themselves," they isolate their will from the reality of their status as tenants. They irrationally believe that by murdering the heir, the right of possession—the "inheritance"—transfers to them, confusing theft with legacy.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και λαβοντεϲ απε αυτον και εξεβαλον εξω του αμπελωνοϲ

**English Translation**
And taking him they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act is total rejection: they destroy the life of the heir and expel his body from the territory. By casting him "out of the vineyard," they profane the very ground they sought to possess. They render the vineyard a place of exclusion, removing the presence of the one who embodies the owner's right to the land.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
τι ουν ποιηϲει ο του αμπελωνοϲ ελευϲεται και απο τουϲ γεωργουϲ και δωϲει τον αμ αλλοιϲ

**English Translation**
What then will the [lord] of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question demands a verdict. The destruction of the farmers is the inevitable fruit of their own violence. The vineyard itself is not abandoned but transferred; the continuity of the plantation is preserved by giving it to "others." Authority and trust are removed from the unworthy and placed where fruit may yet be rendered.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ουδε την γραφην ταυτην ανεγνω λιθον ον απε οι οι · ου εγενηθη ειϲ κε γωνιαϲ ·

**English Translation**
Have you not even read this scripture: A stone which the builders rejected, this became the head of the corner?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "stone" parallels the rejected heir, while the "builders" parallel the farmers. The text declares a divine reversal: the very object deemed unfit by the builders becomes the governing strength of the structure, the "head of the corner." Human rejection serves only to establish the stone's preeminence in the final design.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
παρα εγενετο αυτη και εϲτιν θαυ εν οφθαλ ημων

**English Translation**
From [the Lord] this came to be, and it is wonderful in our eyes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The exaltation of the rejected stone is not of human origin but comes "from" the divine source. It is "wonderful" precisely because it contradicts the judgment of the builders. To the eyes of faith, the reversal of rejection into glory is a marvel, revealing a power that operates above the calculations of men.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και εζητουν αυτ κρατηϲαι και εφο τον οχλ οχλ εγνωϲαν γαρ οτι προϲ αυτουϲ την παραβολην ειπ και αφεντεϲ αυτ αυτ απηλθον

**English Translation**
And they sought to seize him, and feared the crowd, the crowd; for they knew that against them he spoke the parable; and leaving him they went away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Understanding the parable does not lead them to repentance but to malice. They seek to "seize him," thereby fulfilling the role of the farmers in the very story they just heard. Restrained only by fear of the "crowd" rather than fear of truth, they "leave him" and depart, physically enacting the separation from the heir that leads to the loss of the inheritance.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και αποϲτελλουϲ προϲ αυτον τιναϲ των φαριϲαιων και των ηρωδια · ϊνα αυτον α λογω ·

**English Translation**
And they send to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they might [catch] him in word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the alliance of malice; those who differ in worldly politics unite in their hatred of the Truth. They send agents not to learn, but to hunt. The text speaks of a desire to ensnare him in "word," seeking to turn the instrument of salvation—speech—into a mechanism of condemnation. They approach the Word himself to trap him in a word.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντεϲ λεγου αυτω διδαϲκα · οιδαμεν οτι αληθηϲ ει · και ου μελι ϲοι περι ου · ου γαρ βλε ειϲ προϲωπ προϲωπ ανθρωπων αλλ ε αληθειαϲ την ο του διδαϲκιϲ · εξεϲτιν δουναι κηνϲον καιϲαρι · η ου · δωμεν · η μη δω ·

**English Translation**
And coming they say to him, Teacher, we know that you are true, and it is not a care to you about no one; for you do not look into the face [face] of men, but in truth you teach the way of [God]; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? Should we give, or should we not give?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Their lips drip with honey while their hearts forge a sword. They confess he teaches the way of [God] in truth, yet they tempt him as if he were a man of falsehood. The repetition of "face" in the text emphasizes their obsession with external appearances, which they claim he ignores. They pose a double snare: to give is to offend the people; to withhold is to offend Caesar.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ϊδων ϊδωϲ αυ την ειπεν αυτοιϲ τι με πιραζετε φερε μοι δηναριον ωδε ϊνα ειδω

**English Translation**
But he, seeing [knowing] their [intent], said to them, Why do you tempt me? Bring me a denarius here that I may see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reveals his divine perception; he is described as "seeing knowing," for to him, sight and knowledge are one; nothing is hidden. He demands the coin be brought "here," summoning the symbol of earthly power into the presence of divine authority to be judged. He exposes their action as temptation, stripping away their mask of inquiry.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ηνεγκαν και λεγει αυτοιϲ · τινοϲ η εικων αυτη και η επιγραφη · οι δε ειπαν αυτω και ·

**English Translation**
And they brought [it]. And he says to them, Whose is this image and the inscription? And they said to him, Caesar's.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He interrogates the object they carry. The coin bears an image and an inscription, testifying to its master. By acknowledging the image is Caesar's, they confess to whom the gold belongs. They hold the currency of the world, thereby admitting their participation in the world's economy.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπ αυτοιϲ τα καιϲαροϲ αποδοτε καιϲαρι · και τα του τω · και εξεθαυμαζ επ αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And he said to them, The things of Caesar render to Caesar, and the things of [God] to [God]. And they marveled at him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great division. That which bears the image of the earthly king returns to him; that which bears the image of the Creator must return to the Creator. Man is the coin of [God], stamped with the divine likeness. Thus, let the gold go to Caesar, but let the soul rise to [God]. The adversaries are silenced by wisdom, marveling that their trap has become a teaching.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και ερχ ϲαδδουκαιοι προϲ αυτον οιτι λεγουϲιν ανα μη ειναι · κ(αι) επηρωτων αυτον λεγοντεϲ

**English Translation**
And Sadducees come to him, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A new assault begins, not from political zealots but from those cold in faith, who deny the standing up of the dead. They approach the Life to argue for the finality of death. Their error is stated plainly: they say "there is no resurrection," limiting hope to this present age alone.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
διδαϲκα · μωϋϲηϲ εγραψ εγραψ ημιν οτι εαν τινοϲ αδελφοϲ αποθα και καταλιψη γυ και μη αφη τεκνα τεκνον τεκνα ϊνα λαβη ο αδελφοϲ αυτου τ γυναικα και εξα ϲπερμα τω αδελφω αυτου ˙

**English Translation**
Teacher, Moses wrote [wrote] to us that if anyone's brother should die and leave behind a wife and not leave children [child children], that his brother should take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They invoke the Lawgiver, emphasizing that Moses "wrote wrote," doubling the authority of the letter to attack the spirit. They speak of death, wives, and seed, obsessed with the propagation of flesh because they know nothing of the regeneration of the spirit. They view the law of levirate marriage as the only immortality—survival through progeny.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
· · αδελφοι ηϲαν παρ ημ και ὁ ειϲ πρωτοϲ πρωτοϲ ελαβεν γυ και αποθνη ουκ αφηκ ϲπερμα ·

**English Translation**
Brothers were with us, and the first [first] took a wife, and dying left no seed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They construct a tale of futility. The "first first" brother marries and dies barren. It is a history of death swallowing life, intended to mock the power of God. They present the failure of the flesh to remain, using it to argue against the permanence of the soul.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και ο δευ ελαβεν αυ και απεθαν απεθαν μη καταλιπων ϲπερμα · και ο τριτοϲ ωϲαυτωϲ

**English Translation**
And the second took her, and died [died], not leaving seed; and the third likewise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cycle of mortality repeats. The text stammers "died died," emphasizing the finality they perceive in the grave. One after another, they seek to build a house by the flesh, and one after another, they crumble into dust.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και οι ε ουκ αφηκεν αφηκαν ϲπερμα · εϲχατον παντων και η γυ απεθανεν ·

**English Translation**
And the [seven] left [left] no seed; last of all the woman also died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The calculation concludes in total death. The "seven" (represented here by the number's sign) achieve nothing but a shared grave. Finally, the woman, the object of this earthly contention, dies. In their eyes, death is the ultimate victor, erasing all unions and all hope.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
εν τη αναϲταϲει τινοϲ αυτων εϲται γυνη · οι γαρ επτα εϲχον αυτην γυναικα

**English Translation**
In the resurrection, of which of them shall she be wife? For the seven had her as wife.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the blindness of the carnal mind. They project the constraints of time onto eternity. They imagine the resurrection is merely a return to earthly domesticity, asking who possesses the woman, as if she were property. They cannot conceive of a life where the bond is not marriage, but glory.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
εφη αυτοιϲ ο ου δια τουτο πλανα μη ειδοτεϲ ταϲ γραφαϲ μηδε την δυναμιν του

**English Translation**
He said to them, [Is it] not because of this you err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of [God]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He identifies the twin roots of all heresy: ignorance of the sacred writings and ignorance of the power of [God]. They read the words but do not know them; they acknowledge a Creator but deny His power to sustain life beyond the grave. To limit the Almighty to the laws of dust is to not know Him at all.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
οταν γαρ εκ νε αναϲτωϲ αναϲτωϲιν ουτε γαμουϲιν ουτε γαμιζονται αλλ ειϲιν ωϲ αγγε εν τοιϲ ουρα ·

**English Translation**
For when from the dead they rise, they rise, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in the heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The resurrection transforms the human condition, dissolving earthly contracts such as marriage which are necessary only for mortality and propagation. The repetition of the verb "rise" emphasizes the certainty of this event. In the heavens, the faithful assume an angelic mode of existence, purely spiritual and detached from fleshly unions.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
περι δε των νεκρων οτι εγειρ ουκ ανεγνω εν τη βιβλω μωϋϲεωϲ επι του βατου · πωϲ ειπεν αυτω ο λεγ εγω ὁ αβρααμ και ὁ ϊϲακʼ ϊϲαακʼ και ο ϊακωβ ˙

**English Translation**
But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, at the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying: I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
God defines Himself not by the extinguished, but by the enduring; thus, the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob must still exist for Him to be their God. The revelation at the Bush serves as the textual proof that death does not sever the covenant. The threefold repetition of "God" confirms His individual relationship with each patriarch.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ουκ εϲτιν ο νε αλλα ζων · πολυ πλανα πλαναϲθαι

**English Translation**
He is not God of the dead, but of the living; you are much deceived, deceived.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The nature of the Creator dictates the state of His creation; because He is Life, those united to Him cannot remain in the finality of death. The emphatic charge "much deceived," repeated in the text, underscores the grave theological error of denying the resurrection. To misunderstand the living power of God is to wander far from the truth.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων ειϲ των γραμματε ακουϲαϲ αυτ ϲυνζητουντων οτι καλωϲ απεκριθη αυτοιϲ επηρωτηϲεν αυ ποια εϲτιν πρωτη παν ˙

**English Translation**
And one of the scribes having approached, having heard them disputing, seeing that he answered them well, asked him: Which is the first [commandment] of all?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even amidst the contention of disputing voices, wisdom can be recognized and approached. The scribe discerns the quality of the answer, leading him to inquire about the hierarchy of the law. He seeks the "first," the principle from which all other obligations flow.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο οτι πρωτη εϲτ · ακουε · ο ημων ειϲ εϲτ ·

**English Translation**
Jesus answered that the first is: Hear; our God is one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The foundation of all obedience is the act of hearing and the confession of singularity. Before a command can be obeyed, the authority of the One God must be acknowledged. The unity of the Divine is the prerequisite for the unity of the heart in worship.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και αγαπηϲειϲ τον ϲου εξ οληϲ τηϲ καρδιαϲ ϲου κ(αι) εξ οληϲ τηϲ ψυχηϲ ϲου και εξ οληϲ τηϲ διανοιαϲ ϲου και εξ οληϲ τηϲ ϊϲχυ ϲου ·

**English Translation**
And you shall love the [God] of you from your whole heart, and from your whole soul, and from your whole mind, and from your whole strength.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True devotion demands the mobilization of every human faculty: the heart for will, the soul for life, the mind for intellect, and strength for action. The fourfold repetition of "whole" excludes any partiality or divided loyalty. Love is here defined not as a sentiment, but as a total consuming exertion.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
δευτερα αυ εϲτιν αγαπηϲιϲ τον πληϲιον ϲου ωϲ ϲεαυτον · μει δε τουτων αλλη εντολη ουκ ε

**English Translation**
The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself; there is not another commandment greater than these.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The love of the neighbor is inextricably linked to the love of God, serving as its visible evidence. By setting self-regard as the standard ("as yourself"), the law ensures a measure of care that is constant and intuitive. These two commands form the summit of the law, surpassing all others in magnitude.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτω ο γραμματευϲ καλωϲ διδαϲκαλε επ αλη ειπεϲ ειπαϲ · οτι ειϲ εϲτιν και ουκ εϲτ αλλοϲ πλην αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And the scribe said to him: Well, Teacher, in truth you said, you said, that He is one, and there is no other except Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe validates the teaching, reiterating the exclusivity of the Divine nature. The phrase "no other except Him" denies existence to any rival deity or power. The repetition of "you said" affirms the authority of the speaker and the veracity of the doctrine of Oneness.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και το αγαπαν αυτ εξ οληϲ τηϲ καρδι ϲου και εξ οληϲ τηϲ ϲυνεϲεωϲ και εξ οληϲ τηϲ ιϲχυοϲ και το αγαπαν τον πλη ϲου ωϲ ϲεαυ περιϲϲοτερ εϲτιν παντων τ ολοκαυτωματ και των θυϲιων ˙

**English Translation**
And to love Him from the whole of your heart, and from the whole understanding, and from the whole strength, and to love the neighbor as yourself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and the sacrifices.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Internal disposition is superior to external ritual; the "understanding" and "heart" outweigh the smoke of the altar. While sacrifices are offered, love is the substance to which the symbols point. To prioritize moral union with God and neighbor is to fulfill the intent of the law beyond the capacity of burnt offerings.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και ο ειδων οτι νουνεχωϲ απε · ειπεν αυτω ου μακραν απο τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ ει απο τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ απο τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ ει ει απο τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ του και ουδιϲ ουκετι ε επερωτηϲε αυτον αυτον επερωτηϲε

**English Translation**
And Jesus, seeing that he answered wisely, said to him: You are not far from the kingdom, from the kingdom, from the kingdom you are, you are from the kingdom of God. And no one no longer dared to ask him, him to ask.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Wisdom in understanding the law brings one to the very threshold of the kingdom. The intense repetition concerning the "kingdom" in the text signals the urgency and proximity of this divine reign for the one who discerns correctly. The silence that follows indicates that His authority has closed the mouths of the interrogators.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο ελεγεν διδαϲκ εν τω ϊερω πωϲ λεγουϲιν οι γραμ οτι ο ϋϊοϲ εϲτιν

**English Translation**
And answering, Jesus said, teaching in the temple: How do the scribes say that the son is?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Teaching within the holy precincts, Jesus challenges the scribes' theological definitions. He questions their understanding of the title "the son," exposing the limitations of their traditional interpretation. It is a call to re-examine the identity of the expected one.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ ειπεν εν τω τω αγιω ειπ ο τω μου κα εκ δεξιων μ(ου) εωϲ αν θω τουϲ ε ϲου ϋποπο των ποδ ϲου

**English Translation**
He himself said in the, the Holy [Spirit]: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I place your enemies [as] a footstool of your feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The speaker was inspired by the Holy [Spirit], elevating the utterance to divine prophecy. The distinction between "The Lord" and "my Lord" reveals a mystery of lordship within the Godhead. The posture of sitting at the right hand signifies shared authority and the promise of total victory over all adversaries.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ λε αυτον και πωϲ ποθεν αυτου εϲτ · και πολυϲ οχλοϲ ηκουϲεν αυτου η

**English Translation**
He calls him, and how from where is he of him? And much crowd heard him [gladly].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the inquiry into origin and nature. The text asks "how" and "from where," signaling that the relationship between the one calling and the one called is not merely earthly but touches upon a mystery of derivation ("of him"). The crowd hears this interrogation not with fear, but with an attention that implies delight, for the truth of this "from where" satisfies the hunger of the many.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
και εν τη διδαχη αυ λεγεν βλεπετε απο των γραμμα των θελ εν ϲτολαιϲ πε και αϲπα εν ταιϲ αγο

**English Translation**
And in his teaching he said: Look out for the scribes, the ones wishing to walk in robes and greetings in the marketplaces.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The warning is directed against the "wishing," the internal desire for external validation. The "robes" and "greetings" are but symptoms of a soul that seeks its reward in the "marketplaces" of men rather than the silence of God. To "walk" in such vanity is to deviate from the teaching he delivers; thus, the eye must be vigilant ("look out") to separate true authority from the ostentation of the scribes.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και πρωτοκα εν ταιϲ ϲυ και πρω εν τοιϲ διπνοιϲ

**English Translation**
And first seats in the synagogues and first places in the dinners.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ambition permeates both the sacred assembly ("synagogues") and the social table ("dinners"). The thirst for the "first" place corrupts the gathering, turning worship and fellowship into arenas for rank and status. True order is inverted when the heart seeks to be above others rather than beside them in humility.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
οι κατεϲθιοντεϲ ταϲ οικιαϲ των χη και προφαϲει μακρα προϲευχο · ουτοι λημ περιϲϲοτε κριμα

**English Translation**
The ones devouring the houses of the widows and for a pretext praying long; these will receive greater judgment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the severity of divine justice: the "greater judgment" falls upon those who cloak predation with piety. To "devour" the vulnerable ("widows") while feigning devotion ("praying long") is a double iniquity—theft against the poor and mockery against God. The length of the prayer becomes the measure of the condemnation.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και κα κατεναντι του γαζοφυλακι θεωρει εθεωρει πωϲ ο οχλοϲ βαλλει τ χαλκον ειϲ το γα και πολλοι πλουϲιοι εξεβαλλον εβαλλον πολ ·

**English Translation**
And sitting opposite the treasury he was beholding how the crowd casts the copper into the treasury; and many rich were casting much.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He sits "opposite," engaging in a scrutiny of the human heart through the medium of the "treasury." He beholds not merely the gold but the "how"—the manner and disposition of the giving. The "rich" cast "much," yet the text emphasizes the "copper" of the crowd, suggesting that the material substance is weighed differently by the divine observer than by the world.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
και ελθουϲα μι γυνη χηρα πτω εβαλε λεπτα δυο ο εϲτι κοδραν

**English Translation**
And having come one poor widow woman cast two lepta, which is a quadrans.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text isolates "one" figure against the many rich: the "poor widow." Her offering is specified with exactitude—"two lepta"—revealing that nothing is too small to be counted by God. That these sum to a "quadrans" signifies that her poverty has a definite value in the economy of grace; she gives what is tangible and final.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκα τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτου ει αυτοιϲ · αμην λεγω οτι η χηρα αυτη η πτω πλεον παντ εβαλλεν εβαλεν των βαλ ειϲ το γα

**English Translation**
And having called his disciples he said to them: Amen I say that this poor widow cast more than all those casting into the treasury.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He summons the "disciples" to learn a new arithmetic of the spirit. The declaration "Amen I say" affirms a paradox: the destitute woman has given "more than all." Quantity is superseded by intensity; the abundance of the many is less than the totality of the one. This judgment overturns human estimation, placing the "poor widow" at the summit of generosity.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
π γαρ εκ του περιϲ αυτοιϲ εβαλον · αυτη δε εκ τηϲ ϋϲτερηϲε αυτηϲ παντα ο ειχεν εβαλεν ο τον βιον αυτηϲ ·

**English Translation**
For all cast out of the abundance to them; but she out of her deficiency cast all as much as she had, her whole life.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The distinction lies in the source: "abundance" versus "deficiency." To give from surplus is to remain untouched; to give from lack is to offer one's very existence. She cast "her whole life" (bios), signifying a complete abandonment to divine providence. In emptying her hands of "all as much as she had," she fills her soul with trust, becoming the exemplar of perfect sacrifice.
