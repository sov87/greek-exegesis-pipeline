**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲελθων παλ ειϲ καφαρναουμ δι ημερων ηκου οτι εν οικω ε

**English Translation**
And having entered again into Capharnaum after days it was heard that he is in [the] house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord returns to the city of consolation, entering quietly. The rumor of his presence, signified by the abrupt ending "he is," suffices to stir the hearts of the faithful. He does not need to shout to be heard; his very existence in the dwelling place proclaims the Gospel.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυνηχθη πολλοι ωϲτε μηκετι χωριν μη τα προϲ την θυ και ελαλει αυ τον λογον

**English Translation**
And many were gathered together so that no longer was there room, not even the [places] toward the door, and he was speaking the word to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gathering is so dense that the physical entrance is barred, yet the spiritual mouth is open. The obstruction of the door signifies the limitations of the flesh, while the "speaking of the word" demonstrates that the true entry into the mystery is through the ear and the heart, not the architectural threshold.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και ερχονται φερ προϲ αυτον πα αιρομε ϋπο · ·

**English Translation**
And they come bringing to him a paralytic lifted by . .

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The suffering one is brought by others, showing that when one member is weak, the body acts to support it. The text leaves the number of bearers as mere points, suggesting that the identity of the helpers is consumed in the act of service; they are defined solely by their burden and their direction toward the Lord.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και μη δυναμενοι προ προϲ αυτω δι τον οχλον απε την ϲτε οπου ην και εξορυξαντεϲ χα τον κραβακτ οπου ο παραλυτι κατεκειτο

**English Translation**
And not being able to approach him because of the crowd they uncovered the roof where he was and having dug it out they let down the cot where the paralytic was lying.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd, though seeking God, becomes an impediment to the helpless. The true seekers must ascend above the earthly level, removing the covering of the house to reveal the heavens. The digging serves as an image of repentance—breaking through the clay and structure of worldly life to lower one's infirmity before the Divine presence.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδων ο την πιϲτιν αυτων λε τω παραλυτικω τεκνον μου αφε ϲου αι αμαρ

**English Translation**
And seeing the faith of them he says to the paralytic, Child of me, forgiven are your sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord sees what is invisible—faith—and heals what is invisible—sin. He claims the sufferer as "Child of me," establishing a paternity that supersedes the paralysis. The remission of sins is placed first, for the healing of the soul is the foundation upon which the body rests.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε τινεϲ των γραμματε εκει καθημενοι και διαλογιζομε εν ταιϲ καρδι αυτων

**English Translation**
But there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the faithful act by digging and carrying, the scribes merely sit and reason. Their activity is wholly internal and critical. They occupy the seat of judgment but offer no movement toward God, trapping themselves within the confines of their own hearts.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
τι ουτοϲ ουτωϲ λαλει βλα τιϲ δυνα αφιεναι αμαρ ει μη ειϲ ο

**English Translation**
Why does this one speak thus? He blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except one, the [God]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They speak a truth in their error; indeed, only the One can forgive. Their blindness is not in their theology of God's power, but in their failure to recognize that the One they speak of stands before them. They defend God's honor while accusing God's Word.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ ο επι τω αυ οτι ουτωϲ δι εν ε λεγει αυτοιϲ τι ταυτα διαλογι εν ταιϲ καρ υμων

**English Translation**
And immediately the [one] [knowing] in the [spirit] of him that thus they reason within [themselves] says to them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord's knowledge is immediate, requiring no spoken testimony. He perceives the internal dialogue of the critics, proving his divinity by reading the sealed book of the human heart. He answers their silent thoughts with a spoken question, bringing their hidden malice into the light.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
τι εϲτ εϲτ ευκοπωτερον ει τω παραλυ αφιενται ϲου αι αμαρτιαι η ειπειν εγειρε και αρον τον κραβα ϲου και ϋπα

**English Translation**
Which is is easier to say to the paralytic, Forgiven are your sins, or to say, Arise and take up your cot and go?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "is" underscores the reality of the dilemma. He contrasts the word of authority over the soul with the word of power over the body. The harder thing to see (forgiveness) is proven by the harder thing to do physically (instant healing), silencing the skepticism of the intellect with the evidence of the senses.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ϊνα δε ειδητε οτι εξουϲιαν εχι ο του α επι τηϲ γηϲ αφιεναι αμαρτιαϲ λεγει τω παραλυ

**English Translation**
But in order that you may know that authority has the Son of Man on the earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Authority descends to "the earth." The title "Son of Man" bridges the gap between the heavenly judgment seat and the dusty floor of the house in Capharnaum. The miracle is performed not merely for the body's sake, but as a pedagogical act "that you may know."

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
εγειρε ϲοι λε αρον τον κρα ϲου και ϋ ειϲ τον οικ ϲου

**English Translation**
Arise, to you I speak, take up your cot and go into your house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is threefold: resurrection ("Arise"), strength ("take up"), and obedience ("go"). The bed, which once held him prisoner, now becomes a trophy of his liberation. He is sent back to his "house," restoring the domestic order that was disrupted by his infirmity.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και ηγερθη και ευ αραϲ τον κρα εξηλθεν εμπροϲθεν παν ωϲτε εξϊϲτα πανταϲ και δοξαζιν τον λεγονταϲ οτι ου ουδεποτε ε εν τω ι ειδομεν εν τω ι ειδομεν

**English Translation**
And he was raised and immediately having taken the cot he went out before all so that all were amazed and glorified the [God] saying that Not never [thus] in Israel we saw, in Israel we saw.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The visual testimony forces a confession of glory. The double negation "Not never" emphasizes the uniqueness of the event. The stammering repetition at the end—"in Israel we saw, in Israel we saw"—reflects the overwhelming nature of the revelation, where the people of the covenant finally behold the fulfillment of their long waiting.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και εξηλθον εξηλθεν πα ειϲ παρα την θαλαϲ και παϲ ο ο ηρχετο προϲ αυτουϲ αυτον και εδιδα αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And they went out he went out again beside the sea and all the the [crowd] was coming to them him and he was teaching them

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The movement is first plural, then singular, as the authority of the One guides the many. He goes to the sea, a place of open gathering, and the crowd responds by coming to Him. The shift from "them" to "him" in the text focuses the heart upon the single source of doctrine; He alone teaches, and the multitude gathers to be fed by the Word beside the waters.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και παραγων ειδ λευει λευειν τον του αλ καθημεν επι το τελωνιον και λεγει αυτω ακολουθι μοι και αναϲταϲ ηκολου αυτω

**English Translation**
And passing by he saw Leuei Leuein the [son] of Al sitting at the tax office and says to him Follow me and rising up he followed him

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gaze of the Lord falls upon the one sitting in the seat of greed. The name is doubled in the writing, marking the certainty of the calling. The command is simple, demanding the abandonment of the "tax office," which represents the binding to earthly gain. The response is an immediate resurrection: he rises up from his seated commerce to walk after the Master.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και γινεται κατακι αυτον εν τη οικια αυτου και πολ τελωναι και α ϲυνα τω και τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυ ηϲαν γαρ πολλοι και ηκολουθουν αυτω

**English Translation**
And it happens [as] he reclines in his house and many tax collectors and s[inners] were reclining together with him and his disciples for they were many and they were following him

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The house of the convert becomes a hall of fellowship. The distinction between the righteous and the unclean is dissolved at the table where He reclines. Those marked as "s[inners]" are here united with the disciples, showing that the following of Christ gathers the scattered and cleanses the impure through proximity to the Holy One.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και γραμμα των φαριϲαι και ϊδοντεϲ οτι η μετα των τε και αμαρ ελεγον τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου δια τι μετα των τε και αμαρ εϲθιει ο δι υμων

**English Translation**
And scribes of the Pharisees and seeing that he [eats] with the tax [collectors] and sinners were saying to his disciples Why with the tax [collectors] and sinners eats the teacher of you

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribes see the act of eating but miss the mystery of mercy. They question the disciples, fearing to confront the Teacher directly. Their inquiry betrays their separation; they cannot conceive that holiness is a fire that consumes sin rather than being defiled by it. They identify the company by their sins, while the Teacher identifies them by their need.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και ακουϲαϲ ο λε αυτοιϲ ου χριαν εχουϲιν οι ϊϲχυον ϊατρου αλλ οι κακωϲ εχοντεϲ ουκ ηλθον καλε δικαιουϲ αλλα αμαρτωλουϲ

**English Translation**
And hearing [Jesus] says to them No need have the strong of a physician but those having it badly I came not to call righteous [ones] but sinners

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord declares the nature of His mission: it is a healing work. Those who claim strength and righteousness exclude themselves from the cure, for they deny their sickness. The call is effective only for those who acknowledge they "have it badly" in their souls. He does not shun the sinner but seeks him as the doctor seeks the patient.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και ηϲαν οι μαθη ϊωαννου και οι φαριϲαιοι νηϲ και ερχ και λεγουϲιν αυτω δια τι οι μαθη ϊωαννου και οι μαθηται των φαριϲαιων νηϲτευ οι δε μαθη ϲου ου νηϲτευ

**English Translation**
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting and they come and say to him Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inquirers measure piety by the severity of the body, pointing to the fasting of John’s disciples and the Pharisees. They perceive religion as a burden of mourning and restraint. They fail to see that the disciples of the Lord are under a new dispensation where the presence of the Master brings a joy that supersedes the rituals of the old guard.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο μη δυνανται οι ϋϊοι του νυμφω εν ω ο νυμφι μετ αυτων εϲ νηϲτευειν ο χρονον εχου τον νυμφιον μετ αυτων ου δυ νηϲτευε

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] said to them The sons of the bridechamber are not able while the bridegroom is with them to fast [As long a] time [as] they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ reveals Himself as the Bridegroom, defining the present moment as a wedding feast. Fasting, which signifies longing and absence, is impossible in the presence of the Fulfillment. The inability to fast is not a lack of discipline but a necessity of joy; one cannot mourn when the Life is physically present among them.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ελευϲονται δε η οταν απαρ απ αυτων ο νυμφιοϲ και το νηϲτευϲουϲιν εν εκεινη τη η

**English Translation**
But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them and then they will fast in that day

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A shadow is cast over the feast; the Bridegroom will not merely depart but be "taken away," implying the violence of the Cross. The future fasting of the church is identified here not as legal observance, but as the natural response to the removal of His visible presence, waiting in hope for His return.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ουδιϲ επιβλημα ρα αγναφου ε επι ϊματι παλαιον ει δε μη · αιρει πληρω απ αυτου το και του παλαιου και χειρον ϲχιϲ γεινεται

**English Translation**
No one [sews] a patch of uncarded cloth upon an old garment otherwise the fullness takes from it the new from the old and a worse tear happens

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Gospel is not a patch to repair the worn-out garment of the Law. The "uncarded" cloth, fresh and shrinking, possesses a strength that the old fabric cannot withstand. To attempt to merge the raw power of the new grace with the decaying structures of the old covenant results only in the destruction of the old and the waste of the new.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ουδειϲ βαλλει οινον νεον ειϲ α παλαιουϲ · ει δε μη ρηξει ο οι τουϲ αϲκουϲ και ο οινοϲ εκχει και οι αϲκοι α · αλλα οινον νεον ειϲ αϲκουϲ καινουϲ βλητε

**English Translation**
And no one puts new wine into old skins otherwise the wine bursts the skins and the wine is poured out and the skins per[ish] but new wine into new skins [must be put]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Spirit is the new wine, living and fermenting, requiring a vessel that can expand with its power. The old skins, stiffened by tradition and time, will shatter under the internal pressure of this new life. Both the doctrine and the container are preserved only when the newness of the Spirit is received into the newness of a regenerated heart.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο αυτ εν τοιϲ ϲαββαϲιν παραπορευεϲθε δια των ϲποριμ ϲποριμ και οι μαθηται αυ ηρξαντο οδ οδ ποιειν τιλλοντεϲ τουϲ ϲταχυαϲ

**English Translation**
And it happened he in the Sabbaths was passing through the sown fields sown fields and his disciples began to make a way way plucking the ears of grain

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He walks as Lord through the fields of provision on the day of rest. The repetition of "sown fields" and "way" in the text underscores the abundance and the movement of the journey. The disciples pluck the grain, exercising the liberty of the children of God to be fed from the Father's creation, making a path through the harvest even on the Sabbath.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και οι φαριϲαιοι ελε αυτω ϊδε τι ποι τοιϲ ϲαββα · ο ουκ εξεϲτι

**English Translation**
And the Pharisees were saying to him See why are they doing on the Sabbaths that which is not lawful

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisees watch with a critical eye, demanding an account for the breach of rest. They claim the action is "not lawful," binding the hungry with statutes. They fail to recognize that the Lawgiver Himself is present, and where He walks, the rigid constraints of the Sabbath serve the needs of man, not the reverse.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ ου ανεγνω τι εποιηϲεν · οτε χριαν εϲχεν και επιναϲεν αυ και οι μετ αυ

**English Translation**
And he says to them, Did [ye] not read what he did, when he had need and hungered, he and those with him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord rebukes the ignorance of the learned, asking if they have truly engaged with the history of the righteous one who suffered want. Observe how necessity strips away the veneer of ordinance; he who hungered is not named here, yet his action serves as the justification for the blamelessness of the disciples. The text emphasizes "need" (*chreian*) and "hunger" (*epinasen*) as the conditions which clarify the law, showing that the preservation of life in those with him takes precedence over the rigidity of the letter.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
πωϲ ειϲηλθ ειϲ τον οικον του επι αβιαθαρ αρ και τουϲ αρτουϲ τηϲ προθε εφαγεν ουϲ ουκ εξεϲτιν φαγ φαγ ει μη τουϲ ϊερειϲ και εδωκεν και τοιϲ ϲυν αυτω ου

**English Translation**
How he entered into the house of [God] upon Abiathar [the] high [priest], and the loaves of the laying-out he ate, which it is not lawful to eat—to eat—except for the priests, and he gave also to those with him [being].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The entry is made into the very House of [God], a sanctuary where holiness dwells in substance, not merely in shadow. Under Abiathar, the priesthood witnessed a mystery: common hunger consecrated by divine allowance. The "loaves of the laying-out" (*artous tes prothe[seos]*), reserved solely for the priests, become sustenance for the companions of the hungry one. Thus, the distinction between the Levitical exclusivity and the mercy required by life is breached, signaling that the holy bread finds its true end in sustaining the living, not merely in resting upon the table.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυ το ϲαββατον δια τον α εγε και ουχ ο αν δια το ϲαββατον

**English Translation**
And he said to them, The Sabbath on account of the [man] was made, and not the [man] on account of the Sabbath.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the order of creation restored against the inversion of the legalists. The Sabbath was generated (*egeneto*) for the sake of the [man], to serve his rest and sanctification, not to act as his jailer. The [man]—the crown of God's work—is not brought into existence to service a temporal day. By placing the human creature as the cause (*dia*) of the Sabbath's existence, the Lord subordinates the observance to the observer, declaring that the day serves the spiritual and physical good of the living soul.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ωϲτε εϲτιν ο του και του ϲαβ

**English Translation**
So that he is the [Son] of the [Man] and of the Sab[bath].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The conclusion affirms a supreme identity. He is not merely a subject under the law, but stands in a relationship of origin and essence to it. By declaring himself the [Son] of the [Man] and also of the Sabbath, he asserts an authority that encompasses both the human nature and the divine ordinance. He does not destroy the Sabbath but embodies its final purpose; he *is* of the Sabbath, its very substance and Lord, defining its limits and its liberties by his own presence.
