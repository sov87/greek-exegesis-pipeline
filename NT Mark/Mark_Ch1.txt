**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
αρχη του ευαγγελι

**English Translation**
Beginning of the gospel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred narrative commences not with the law or the prophets, but with a new origin. This beginning establishes the foundation of the good tidings, signaling a departure from the shadows of the past into the light of the new proclamation.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
καθωϲ γε εν τω ηϲα τω προφητη ϊδου εγω αποϲτε τον αγγελον μου προ προϲωπου ϲου οϲ καταϲκευαϲει την οδον ϲου

**English Translation**
As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Isaiah the prophet serves as the witness to the divine plan. The messenger is dispatched in advance, for the face of the Lord requires a path prepared by human agency under divine command. The construction of this way is the necessary precursor to the arrival.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
φωνη βοωντοϲ τη ερημω ετοιμα την οδον ευθιαϲ ποιειτε ταϲ τριβουϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
A voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way; make straight his paths.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The wilderness becomes the locus of the proclamation. The cry demands an active preparation of the way. To make the paths straight signifies the rectification of the heart and the removal of obstacles for him who approaches.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και ε ϊωαννηϲ ο βαπτιζων εν τη ερημω και κηρυϲ βαπτιϲμα με ειϲ αφεϲ αμαρτιων

**English Translation**
And John came, the one baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for remission of sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John appears in the desolation, linking the rite of water to the turning of the mind. The baptism he proclaims is not merely a washing of the body but is inextricably bound to repentance, aiming solely at the remission of sins.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και εξεπορευετο προϲ αυτον παϲα η ϊουδαια χωρα και οι ϊεροϲολυμειτε ϊεροϲολυμειται παντεϲ κ(αι) εβαπτιζ ϋπ αυτου εν τω ϊορδανη ποταμω εξομολογουμενοι ταϲ αμαρτιαϲ αυτ

**English Translation**
And all the Judean country and all the Jerusalemites went out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inhabitants of the city and the country abandon their dwellings to seek the wilderness. The act of baptism in the Jordan river requires the public acknowledgment of faults, as confession precedes the cleansing.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και ην ο ϊωαννηϲ ενδεδυμενοϲ τρι καμηλου και ζω δερματινην περι την οϲφυν αυτου και εϲθων εϲθιων ακριδαϲ και μελι αγριον

**English Translation**
And John was clothed with camel's hair and a leathern belt about his loins, and eating locusts and wild honey.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prophet's raiment testifies to his austerity and separation from worldly softness. Clothed in the hair of the camel and bound by skin, he sustains himself on the provision of the wild, rejecting the bread of the city for the food of the desert.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και εκηρυϲϲεν λε ερχεται ο ϊϲχυ μου οπιϲω μου ου ουκ ειμι ι ειμη κανοϲ κυψαϲ λυϲαι τον ϊμαντα των ϋποδηματων αυ

**English Translation**
And he preached, saying: There comes the one mightier than I after me, of whom I am not worthy, having stooped down, to loose the thong of his sandals.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John acknowledges his own inferiority before the strength of the one coming after. The posture of servitude is absolute; he deems himself unfit even for the menial task of unbinding the sandals of the mighty one.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
εγω εβαπτιϲα ϋμαϲ ϋδατι αυτοϲ δε βα υμαϲ εν αγι

**English Translation**
I baptized you with water, but he shall baptize you in the Holy [Spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A clear distinction separates the ministries. The present immersion utilizes the element of water, but the future immersion plunges the believer into the Holy. The transition is from the material sign to the divine reality.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο εν εκει ταιϲ ημεραιϲ ηλθεν απο ναζα τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ και εβαπτιϲθη ειϲ τον ϊορδανην ϋπο ϊωαννου

**English Translation**
And it came to pass in those days, he came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized into the Jordan by John.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the fullness of time, the traveler arrives from Nazareth of Galilee. He submits to the rite within the Jordan, receiving baptism at the hands of John, thereby fulfilling the pattern established in the wilderness.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ αναβενων εκ του ϋδατοϲ ειδεν ϲχι τουϲ ο και το ωϲ περιϲτεραν κα και με επ αυτον

**English Translation**
And immediately coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting, and the [Spirit] as a dove descending and remaining upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ascent from the water precipitates the vision of the torn heavens. The divine presence manifests visually as a dove, not merely hovering but descending and abiding upon him, marking him out from all others.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και φωνη εγενετο εκ τ ο ϲυ ει ο μου ο αγαπητοϲ εν ϲοι ευδοκηϲα ·

**English Translation**
And a voice came out of the heavens: You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The silence of the heavens is broken by the voice of the Father. The declaration confirms the identity of the beloved Son, locating the totality of divine pleasure within him alone.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ το αυ εκβαλλει ειϲ την ερημον

**English Translation**
And immediately the [Spirit] drives him out into the wilderness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine affirmation is instantly followed by expulsion. The Spirit exerts force to cast him into the solitude of the wilderness, proving that the sonship is tested in isolation rather than celebrated in the city.

Codex Sinaiticus Exegesis | Chapter 1 (Verses 13-24)

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και ην εν τη ερημω · · ημεραϲ πιραζο ϋπο του ϲα και ην μετα των θηριων και οι αγγελοι διηκονο αυτω

**English Translation**
And he was in the wilderness days being tempted by Satan, and he was with the wild beasts, and the angels were ministering to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We observe the solitude of the wilderness inhabited only by the combatants: the Tempted One, the Tempter, and the witnesses of creation. The text speaks of "days" without number, suggesting an indefinite duration of trial where time itself is suspended in the struggle against Satan. The presence of wild beasts signifies the restoration of dominion over nature, while the angels minister, proving that heaven does not abandon the just man in his ordeal.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
μετα δε το παραδο τον ϊωαν ηλθεν ο ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν κη το ευαγ του

**English Translation**
And after the delivering up of John, he came into Galilee preaching the gospel of the.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The delivering up of John serves as the threshold for the arrival of the new proclamation. He enters Galilee not with a sword, but with a word, "preaching." The text abruptly ends with the genitive "of the," leaving the object of the gospel hanging; this silence forces the hearer to understand that this gospel belongs to a source so supreme it need not even be named to be understood.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
λεγων οτι πεπληρωται ο και και ηγγεικεν η βαϲιλια του μετανοειτε και πιϲτευεται εν τω ευαγγελιω

**English Translation**
Saying that the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of the has drawn near; repent and believe in the gospel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Two great realities converge here: the fulfillment of the appointed time and the nearness of the kingdom. Once again, the kingdom is described simply as "of the," pointing to the Divine origin without limiting it by a name. The command is twofold and inseparable: one must turn the mind (repent) and anchor trust in the good tidings (believe), for the nearness of the kingdom requires a prepared vessel.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και παραγων πα την θαλαϲϲαν τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ ει ιδεν ϲιμωνα και ανδρεαν τον α ϲιμωνοϲ αμφιβαλλονταϲ εν τη θαλαϲϲη ηϲ γαρ αλιειϲ

**English Translation**
And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andreas the brother of Simon casting around in the sea, for they were fishers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine gaze falls upon the ordinary labor of men, finding Simon and Andreas in the midst of their trade. The text emphasizes their fraternity and their function: they cast nets because they are fishers by nature and necessity. He meets them not in a temple, but at the sea, sanctifying the place of their toil as the site of their calling.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και ειπ αυτοιϲ ο δευτε οπιϲω μου και ποι ϋμαϲ γενεϲ αλεειϲ

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Come after me and I will make you become fishers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The call is a command to movement: "Come after me." He does not promise them a new trade, but a transformation of their identity; they are to "become fishers" in a new and absolute sense. The object of their fishing is not stated in this verse, implying that the scope of their net is now as vast and undefined as the command itself.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ αφεντεϲ τα δικτυα ηκολου αυτω

**English Translation**
And immediately leaving the nets, they followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no interval between the voice and the obedience. The "nets"—the instruments of their livelihood and their past identity—are abandoned "immediately." To follow him requires a letting go, a physical and spiritual release of what occupied their hands, so that they may walk behind the one who leads.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και προβαϲ ολιγον εκειθ εκειθ ϊδεν ϊακωβον τ του ζεβεδεου και ϊωαννην τον α αυτου και αυτουϲ εν τω πλοι καταρτιζονταϲ τα δικτυα

**English Translation**
And going on a little from there from there, he saw James the of Zebedee and John his brother, and them in the boat mending the nets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The progression continues "from there from there," a stutter in the text that marks the relentless forward motion of the caller. He finds James and John not casting, but "mending"—an act of restoration and preparation. The lineage is noted—"of Zebedee"—marking them as sons of an earthly father whom they will soon transcend for a higher kinship.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ εκαλεϲεν αυτουϲ και αφεντεϲ τον αυτων ζεβεδε εν τω πλοιω μετα των μιϲθω απηλθον ο αυτου

**English Translation**
And immediately he called them; and leaving their Zebedee in the boat with the hired [men], they went away after him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The severance is sharp: they leave "their Zebedee," a phrasing that emphasizes the personal bond being broken. They leave him in the structure of the old life, "the boat," and with the structure of commerce, "the hired [men]." They depart "after him," exchanging the stability of the father's boat for the uncertainty of the disciple's path.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲπορευον ειϲ καφαρναουμ και ευθυϲ τοιϲ ϲαβ εδιδαξεν εδιδαϲκεν ειϲ την ϲυναγω

**English Translation**
And they enter into Capernaum; and immediately on the sabbaths he taught he was teaching into the synagogue.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Upon entering the city, the priority is the sacred time, "the sabbaths," and the sacred place, "the synagogue." The text presents a duality of action, "he taught he was teaching," reinforcing the intensity and persistence of his doctrine. He does not merely speak; he pours his teaching "into" the assembly, filling the space with a new authority.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και εξεπληϲ επι τη διδα αυτου ην γαρ δι αυτουϲ ωϲ εξουϲιαν εχ και ουχ ωϲ οι γραμ

**English Translation**
And they were astonished at his teaching; for he was teaching them as having authority and not as the scribes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reaction of the crowd is astonishment, struck by the quality of the word rather than its content alone. The distinction is made between "authority" and the manner of "the scribes"; the latter speak from text and tradition, while he speaks from a possession of power ("having authority"). This authority is intrinsic to his person, not derived from external validation.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ ην εν τη ϲυναγω αυτων ανοϲ ακαθαρτω κ(αι) ανεκραξεν

**English Translation**
And immediately there was in their synagogue a man [in] unclean, and he cried out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of holiness immediately reveals the presence of the profane. "Immediately" a man described only by his condition—"unclean"—manifests within the holy precinct. The Greek dative "unclean" hangs upon the man, suggesting he is enveloped or possessed by this impurity. His reaction to the teaching is not astonishment, but a cry of distress.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
λεγ εα τι ημιν και ϲοι ναζαρηνε ηλθεϲ απολεϲε απολεϲαι ημαϲ οι ϲε τιϲ ει ο αγιοϲ του

**English Translation**
Saying: Ea! What to us and to thee, Nazarene? Didst thou come to destroy to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy [One] of the.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The unclean spirit initiates the confrontation with a sharp interjection ("Ea!") and a recognition of the separation between "us" and "thee." The repetition "to destroy to destroy" betrays the trembling terror of the demonic in the face of its judge. It confesses what men have not yet grasped: he is the "Nazarene" on earth, but in truth, he is "the Holy [One] of the," acknowledging his origin from the Divine source that the text leaves unspoken.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και ε αυτω ο λεγων φιμωθητι κ(αι) εξελθε εξ αυτου

**English Translation**
And he [rebuked] him, the [one] saying: Be muzzled and come out of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority acts immediately upon the possessed, severing the voice of the unclean spirit before removing its presence. By commanding silence, he denies the demon the power of speech, establishing that the evil one has no right to testify, even if it speaks truth, for it is bound to the darkness from which it must now return.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και ϲπαραξαν αυτ το π το ακαθαρτ και φωνηϲαν φω μεγαλη εξηλ εξ αυτου

**English Translation**
And tearing him, the unclean spirit, and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The departure of the spirit is marked by violence and noise, a final convulsion of the chaos that opposes order. It tears the vessel it can no longer inhabit, proving that its nature is destruction; yet it yields, demonstrating that its malice is subordinate to the command given.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και εθαμβηθηϲαν απαντεϲ ωϲτε ϲ ϲ αυτουϲ λεγ τι εϲτιν τουτο διδαχη καινη κα εξουϲιαν και τοιϲ τοιϲ ακαθαρ επιταϲϲι και ϋπακουουϲιν αυ

**English Translation**
And all were amazed, so that [they questioned] among themselves saying: What is this? A new teaching according to authority; even the unclean [spirits] he commands, and they obey him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitude perceives a doctrine that is not merely spoken but enacted. This "new teaching" is defined by its operative power; it does not simply describe the spiritual realm but exerts dominion over it, compelling obedience from forces that terrify the natural man.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και εξηλθεν η ακο αυτου ευθυϲ πανταχη ειϲ ολην τ περιχωρον τηϲ ϊ γαλιλαιαϲ

**English Translation**
And the hearing of him went out immediately everywhere into the whole surrounding region of Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rumor of authority travels as swiftly as the command itself. The surrounding region of Galilee becomes the recipient of the report, preparing the land for the presence of the one whose word carries such weight that it traverses boundaries instantly.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ ευθυϲ πανταχη κ(αι) και ευθυϲ εκ τηϲ ϲυναγωγηϲ εξελθοντεϲ ηλθ ειϲ την οικιαν ϲι και ανδρε μετα ϊακωβου και ϊωαννου

**English Translation**
And immediately, immediately everywhere and immediately coming out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "immediately" emphasizes the urgency of the movement from the public sphere to the private. He passes from the synagogue, the place of the law, into the house of Simon and Andrew, the place of domestic life, indicating that the power manifested in the assembly is equally applicable to the family dwelling.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
η δε πενθερα ϲιμωνοϲ κατεκειτο πυρεϲ και ευθυϲ λε αυτω πε αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
Now the mother-in-law of Simon was lying down fevered, and immediately they speak to him concerning her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ailment of the body is brought to him with the same promptness as the possession of the spirit. The disciples do not hesitate but speak concerning her, understanding that his presence is the remedy for the fever that binds the mother of the house.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και προϲ ηγειρεν αυτην κρατηϲαϲ τηϲ χιροϲ και αφη αυτην ο πυ και διηκο αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And coming to [her], he raised her, grasping the hand; and the fever left her, and she served them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He raises her by touch, grasping the hand to impart strength where there was infirmity. The restoration is complete and functional; the fever departs not merely so she may rest, but that she may serve, restoring her to her role within the community of the house.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
οψιαϲ δε γενομε οτε εδυ ο ηλι εφερον προϲ αυτον πανταϲ τουϲ κακωϲ εχονταϲ και τουϲ δαιμονιζομενουϲ

**English Translation**
And evening having become, when the sun set, they brought to him all those having ailments and the demon-possessed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As the sun sets and the Sabbath restrictions lift, the accumulated suffering of the people is brought forward. The distinction between physical illness and spiritual possession is maintained, yet both find their resolution in the one who stands ready in the evening shadow.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και ην ο η πολιϲ επιϲυνηγμενη προϲ την θυραν

**English Translation**
And the whole city was gathered together at the door.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The door becomes the threshold between human misery and divine relief. The compression of the "whole city" into this single point illustrates the desperate focus of the world upon the only source of power capable of addressing its manifold griefs.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και εθεραπευϲεν πολλουϲ κακωϲ εχονταϲ ποικιλαιϲ νοϲοιϲ και δαιμονια πολ εξεβαλλεν και ουκ ηφιε ηφιεν λαλιν τα δαιμονια οτι ηδιϲαν αυτον τον ειν(αι)

**English Translation**
And he healed many having ailments with various diseases and cast out many demons; and he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him to be [the one].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He governs the spiritual world with strict constraints, refusing the testimony of the demonic. Though they possess knowledge of who he is, their speech is silenced because truth must not be proclaimed by the mouths of the unclean, lest the holy be associated with the profane.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και πρωϊ εννυχα λειαν αναϲταϲ ε και απηλ ειϲ ερημον το κακι προϲηϋ

**English Translation**
And early, very much in the night, having risen, he [went out] and went away into a desert place, and there he prayed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He withdraws from the acclaim of the city to the silence of the desert. This movement into solitude reveals that the power displayed in public is rooted in the hidden communion of prayer, establishing a pattern where service to the multitude is bracketed by devotion to the Father.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και κατεδιω αυτον ϲιμ ϲιμ και οι μετ αυτου

**English Translation**
And Simon and those with him hunted him down.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Simon and his companions pursue him, not with the intent of joining his prayer, but to reclaim him for the crowd. Their action is described as a hunt, revealing their misunderstanding of his mission; they seek to capture the worker of miracles rather than follow the master of the desert.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και ευρον αυτον και λεγουϲιν αυτω οτι παντεϲ ζητου ϲε

**English Translation**
And they found him and say to him, "All seek you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The declaration "All seek you" reveals the universal thirst of the created order for its Creator. The soul, often unknowingly, hunts for the source of its being, and here the disciples articulate the collective groaning of humanity. To find Him is the resolution of this search; to speak to Him is the beginning of prayer.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ α αλλαχου ειϲ ταϲ εχομεναϲ κωμοπολιϲ ϊνα κακει κηρυξω ειϲ τουτο γαρ εξηλθ

**English Translation**
And he says to them, "Let us go elsewhere into the neighboring country towns, that there also I may preach; for to this end I came out."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Divine Word does not stagnate but moves "elsewhere," extending grace to the "country towns" with the same dignity as the city. The purpose of His Incarnation is explicit: He "came out" from the Father specifically to proclaim the truth. This preaching is not incidental but is the very end for which He proceeded forth.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και ηλθεν κηρυϲϲ κηρυϲϲ ειϲ ταϲ ϲυναγωγαϲ αυτων ειϲ ολην την γαλιλαιαν και τα δαιμονια εκ

**English Translation**
And he came preaching, preaching into their synagogues into all Galilee, and casting out the demons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition "preaching, preaching" emphasizes the unceasing and urgent nature of the proclamation which fills "all Galilee." The entry into the synagogues brings light, while the act of "casting out" expels the darkness of the demons. The ministry is thus twofold: the establishment of truth through the word and the purgation of evil through power.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και ερχεται προϲ αυτον λεπροϲ πα αυτον και γονυπετων κ(αι) λεγων αυτω οτι ε θεληϲ δυναϲε δυναϲαι με καθαριϲαι

**English Translation**
And a leper comes to him, beseeching him and kneeling and saying to him, "If you will, you are able, able to cleanse me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The leper’s posture of "kneeling" signifies the submission of the flesh to the Spirit. By saying "If you will," he acknowledges the absolute sovereignty of the Divine volition, locating the cure not in a formula but in the Lord's will. The stuttering confession "able, able" reinforces the certainty of faith: there is no question of capacity, only of willingness.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και ϲπλαγχνιϲθειϲ εκτιναϲ την χει αυτου ηψατο κ(αι) λεγει θελω καθα

**English Translation**
And being moved with compassion, stretching out his hand, he touched and says, "I will; be cleansed."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Compassion moves the hand to bridge the abyss between the holy and the unclean. By touching the leper, He does not contract defilement but imparts sanctification. The utterance "I will" is immediately conjoined with the command "be cleansed," demonstrating that His will and His word are efficient causes of reality.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ απηλθεν απ αυ η λεπρα και εκα

**English Translation**
And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The effect follows the command "immediately," admitting no interval of time between the Divine will and the restoration of nature. The disease "departed from him," signifying the separation of the corruption from the man. He "was cleansed," restored to the integrity of the image in which he was made.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και εμβρι αυ ευθυϲ εξεβαλ αυτον

**English Translation**
And sternly charging him, immediately he cast him out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The severity of the "stern charge" protects the mystery of the operation. He "cast him out" not in rejection, but with the force of a mandate, sending the healed man from the presence of the Healer to the duty of obedience. The urgency of the dismissal prevents the miracle from becoming a spectacle of mere wonder.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτω ορα μηδε ειπηϲ αλλα ϋ ϲαυτον διξ τω ιερει και προ προϲ περι του καθαριϲμου ϲου α προϲεταξεν μω ειϲ μαρτυρι αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And he says to him, "See that you say nothing to no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Silence is enjoined to preserve humility. The command to follow what "Moses commanded" validates the Law, showing that the One who heals is the Author of the Law, not its destroyer. The offering serves as a "testimony to them," providing legal proof of the cleansing to the priests who guard the community.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εξελθων ηρ κηρυϲϲιν πολ και διαφημιζ τον λογον ωϲτε μηκετι δυναϲθε δυναϲθαι αυτον ειϲ πολιν φανερωϲ ειϲελθ αλλ εξω επ ερημοιϲ τοποιϲ ην και ηρ προϲ αυτον παντοθεν

**English Translation**
But he, going out, began to preach much and to blaze abroad the word, so that he was no longer able, able to enter openly into a city, but was outside in desert places; and they came to him from every quarter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The man’s disobedience in speech results in the "word" blazing abroad, forcing the Master into "desert places." A profound inversion occurs: the leper returns to the city, and the Holy One inhabits the wilderness. Yet, the desert cannot hide the Light, for "they came to him from every quarter," drawn by necessity to the source of life.
