**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ αμην λεγω ϋμ οτι ειϲιν τινεϲ των ωδε εϲτωτ οιτινεϲ ου μη γευ θανατου εωϲ αν ϊδωϲιν την βαϲιλιαν του εληλυθυϊαν δυναμει

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Amen I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of the [one] having come in power.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise is given that the sight of the Kingdom is not reserved solely for the post-mortal state but breaks into the present life for chosen witnesses. To "taste of death" implies the common lot of humanity, yet here, a vision of power precedes that final cup, strengthening the soul against the mortality of the flesh. The Kingdom is described as "having come in power," signifying that its reality is already established by the one speaking, awaiting only the opening of the eyes of the faithful.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και μετα ημεραϲ εξ παραλαμβανι ο τον πετρον και τον ϊακωβ και τον ϊωανν και αναφερι αυτουϲ ειϲ οροϲ ϋψηλον λιαν κατ ϊδιαν μο · και μετεμορ εμπροϲθ αυτων

**English Translation**
And after six days he takes along Peter and Jacob and John, and leads them up into a high mountain very much apart alone; and he was transformed before them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ascent after six days mirrors the time of creation leading to rest, or the approach to Sinai. He separates Peter, Jacob, and John from the multitude and the other disciples, for the revelation of glory requires a withdrawal from earthly noise and a spiritual elevation represented by the high mountain. To be "transformed" is not a change of his nature, but a disclosure of the indwelling glory that the veil of flesh usually conceals from human sight.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και τα ϊμα αυτου εγενετο ϲτιλβοντα λευκα λιαν · οια γναφευϲ επι τηϲ γηϲ ου δυνα ουτωϲ λευκανε λευκαναι

**English Translation**
And his garments became shining, white very much, such as a fuller upon the earth is not able thus to whiten.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The whiteness described here surpasses all terrestrial craft; no "fuller" or launderer using earthly means can achieve such purity. This light is uncreated, radiating from the person and saturating even the material garments, showing that created matter can participate in divine glory. It signifies the purity of the world to come, which human effort cannot manufacture.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και ωφθη αυτοιϲ η ϲυν μωϋϲη και ηϲαν λαλο τω

**English Translation**
And there appeared to them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with the [one].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Law, represented by Moses, and the Prophets, represented by Elias, converge upon the mountain to testify to the one standing in glory. Their presence demonstrates that the old covenant was a preparation for this moment, and they are seen "talking with" him as servants conversing with their Lord. Death (Moses) and translation (Elias) are both subject to his dominion.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο πε λεγει τω · ραβ καλον εϲτιν ημαϲ ωδε ειναι · και ποιηϲωμεν · · ϲκηναϲ ϲοι μι και μωυϲει μιαν και ηλια μιαν ·

**English Translation**
And answering, Peter says to the [one]: Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make tents, for thee one, and for Moses one, and for Elias one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, overwhelmed by the good of the vision, seeks to capture the moment and give it permanent earthly dwelling ("tents"). He recognizes the dignity of the guests but errs in his equality of distribution, offering one tent for the Rabbi and one each for the servants, Moses and Elias. He wishes to remain in the glory of the mountain without descending to the suffering that must follow.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ου γαρ ηδι τι απεκρι εκφοβοι γαρ ε

**English Translation**
For he knew not what he should answer, for they became terrified.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The proposal of the tents was not born of reasoned theology but of the confusion that arises from holy terror. The presence of the divine, while "good" (as stated in the previous verse), strikes fear into the mortal heart, causing the tongue to speak things it does not fully understand.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο νεφε επειϲκιαζου αυτοιϲ · και εγε εκ τηϲ νεφε φωνη · ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο μου ο αγαπητοϲ εν ω ηυδοκηϲα ακουε αυτου

**English Translation**
And there came a cloud overshadowing them; and there came a voice out of the cloud: This is the [one] of me, the beloved, in whom I was well pleased; hear ye him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cloud, the ancient sign of divine presence, removes the reliance on sight and demands the obedience of hearing. The Father's voice corrects Peter’s error of equal tents by singling out the one who is "the beloved" and in whom divine pleasure rests. The command "hear ye him" establishes his authority as absolute, superseding the servants Moses and Elias who stand by.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και εξαπινα περι ου ουδενα ειδ ει μη τον μο μεθ εαυτ

**English Translation**
And suddenly looking around [where], they saw no one any longer, except the [one] only with themselves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vision ends as abruptly as it began, leaving "the one only" remaining. Moses and Elias have vanished, for their preparatory work is complete; the Law and Prophets recede so that the Truth alone may abide with the disciples. This solitude with the Master signifies that he is the sufficient and final scope of all revelation.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και καταβαινοντ αυτων απο του ο διεϲτιλατο αυτοιϲ ϊνα μηδε ἁ ειδον διηγη ει μη οταν ο του ανθρωπου εκ νεκρων αναϲτη ·

**English Translation**
And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should relate to no one what things they saw, except when the son of man should rise from the dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The glory of the mountain cannot be rightly proclaimed until the humiliation of the cross and the victory of the resurrection are accomplished. To speak of the transfiguration before the "son of man" rises from the dead would present a incomplete Christ—a glorious king without the conquering of death. Silence is the guardian of the mystery until the proper time of fullness.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και τον λογον ε προϲ εαυτουϲ ϲυνζη τι εϲτιν το εκ νεκρων ανα

**English Translation**
And they kept the word to themselves, questioning what is the rising from the dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples obey the command of silence ("kept the word") but grapple with the meaning of the condition. They know of the general resurrection at the end of time, but the specific rising of the son of man from the dead remains a riddle to them. They struggle to understand how the one they just saw in glory must undergo death to achieve this rising.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και επηρωτων αυτ λεγοντεϲ οτι λεγου οι φαριϲαιοι κ(αι) οι γραμματιϲ οτι ηλιαν δι ελθειν πρωτον

**English Translation**
And they were asking him, saying: Why do the Pharisees and the Scribes say that Elias must come first?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Having just seen Elias withdraw, the disciples are confused by the teaching of the Scribes that Elias must come "first" to prepare the way. They wonder if the brief vision on the mountain fulfilled this, or if the scribal tradition contradicts the reality they just witnessed. They seek to reconcile the prophetic timeline with the presence of the one before them.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε εφη αυτοιϲ η μεν ελθων πρωτον πρωτοϲ αποκα αποκαθιϲτανι παντα κ(αι) πωϲ γεγραπται ε τον του ϊνα πολλα παθη και εξουθενωθη

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Elias indeed having come first, restores all things; and how it is written concerning the [son] of the [man] that he should suffer many things and be set at nought.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He affirms the order of history: Elias does come first to restore. Yet, he immediately binds this restoration to the necessity of suffering. The restoration of "all things" involves the rejection of the "son of the man" by the world. To be "set at nought" is the paradoxical path to the glory witnessed on the mountain; the scripture foretells both the forerunner and the passion of the one who follows.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
αλλα λεγω ϋμιν οτι και ηλιαϲ εληλυθεν και εποιηϲαν εν αυ οϲα ηθελον καθωϲ γεγραπτε επ αυτον

**English Translation**
But I say to you that Elijah also has come, and they did in him as many things as they wished, just as it is written upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The return of the prophet is not marked by triumph but by suffering, fulfilling what is written upon him. The world treats the messenger according to its own will, inflicting whatever it wishes, yet this very rejection serves the divine decree. The scriptural testimony is validated not in the reception of honor, but in the endurance of the passion prepared for the servant.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντεϲ προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ ει οχλον πολ περι αυτουϲ και γραμματειϲ ϲυν προϲ εαυτουϲ αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And coming to the disciples [they] saw a crowd much around them and scribes with [them] toward themselves them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
When the Teacher is absent, the disciples are besieged by the multitude and the scribes. The text portrays a scene of pressure, where the scribes are not merely present but are positioned with the disciples, pressing toward them among themselves. The faithful, when isolated from their Head, find themselves surrounded by disputation and the weight of the crowd.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ παϲ ο οχλοϲ ϊδον αυτον εξεθαμ και προϲ ηϲπα αυτον

**English Translation**
And immediately all the crowd seeing him were amazed and [running] to [him] greeted him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mere sight of Him transforms the atmosphere of the gathering; the crowd is struck with amazement before a word is spoken. Their immediate turning from the scribes to greet Him reveals that the authority of the divine presence supersedes all human contention. Reverence replaces confusion the moment He appears.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και επηρωτηϲεν αυτουϲ · τι ϲυνζη προϲ εαυτουϲ αυτουϲ εαυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And he asked them: What do you dispute toward themselves them themselves?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He interrogates the nature of their conflict, exposing the circular and internalized confusion of the group. The repetition in the text—toward themselves, them, themselves—mirrors the chaotic and self-referential nature of arguments devoid of truth. He demands an account of this fruitless inward strife.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και απεκριθη αυτω ειϲ εκ του οχλου διδαϲκαλε ηνεγ τον μου προϲ ϲε εχοντα αλαλον

**English Translation**
And one of the crowd answered him: Teacher, I brought my [son] to thee having a dumb [spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A single voice rises from the confusion, addressing Him as Teacher and presenting an offering of sorrow. The father brings his own, possessed by that which silences speech; the affliction renders the victim unable to cry out for himself, necessitating the intercession of the parent. The dumbness of the spirit stands in contrast to the clamor of the scribes.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και οπου εαν αυτον κατα ρηϲϲει και αφριζει και τριζει τουϲ οδονταϲ και ξηραινεται και ει τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ ϲου ϊνα αυτο εκ και ουκ ϊ

**English Translation**
And wherever it seizes him, it tears [him], and he foams and gnashes the teeth and withers; and I spoke to thy disciples that they might cast it out, and they were not strong [enough].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The dominion of the enemy is physical and destructive, manifesting in seizing, tearing, and withering the life of the victim. The failure of the disciples—that they were not strong—demonstrates that authority over such darkness is not inherent to the follower but requires a power they did not yet possess. The incapacity of the servant points to the necessity of the Master.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ αυ λεγει · ω γενε απιϲτοϲ εωϲ πο προϲ ϋμαϲ εϲο εωϲ ποτε α υμων φερετε αυτον προ προϲ εμε

**English Translation**
But answering them he says: O faithless generation, until when shall I be with you? Until when shall I bear with you? Bring him to to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He laments the lack of faith, not merely in the crowd but in the entire generation that surrounds Him. His questions reveal the burden of holiness dwelling amidst unbelief, a divine patience that endures the limits of human frailty. The command "bring him to to me" signifies that where the disciples fail, He alone suffices; the solution to the generation's impotence is proximity to Him.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και ηνεγκ ηνεγκ αυτον προϲ αυτον και ϊδων αυτον το ευθυϲ ϲυνε αυτον και πεϲων επι τηϲ γηϲ εκυλιετο αφριζων

**English Translation**
And they brought brought him to him. And seeing him, the [spirit] immediately convulsed him; and falling upon the earth he wallowed foaming.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of the act of bringing emphasizes the urgency and the struggle. Upon seeing Him, the evil force reacts violently, for darkness cannot stand peacefully in the presence of Light. The convulsion and wallowing on the earth display the final, desperate rebellion of the spirit before the authority of the Holy One.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και επηρωτηϲεν τον αυτου πο χρονοϲ εϲτ ωϲ εξ ου τουτο γεγον αυτω ο δε ειπεν εκ παι ·

**English Translation**
And he asked his [father]: How much time is it since this has happened to him? And he said: From a child.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He inquires into the duration of the suffering, not for information, but to reveal the depth of the tragedy. The answer "from a child" exposes a lifetime of bondage, emphasizing the mercy required to liberate one who has known only oppression since the beginning of his days.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και πολ και ειϲ πυρ αυτον εβαλεν και ειϲ ϋδατα · ϊνα απολεϲη αυτον αλλα ει τι δυνη βο ημιν ϲπλαγχνιϲθειϲ εφ ημαϲ

**English Translation**
And often it cast him both into fire and into waters, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst any[thing], help us, being moved with compassion upon us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The malice of the spirit seeks destruction through the extremes of fire and water, leaving no place of safety. The father's plea—"if thou canst"—betrays the fragility of his hope, conditioned by the disciples' failure. He appeals to the capacity of the Teacher and begs for compassion not just for the son, but "upon us," uniting his own suffering with that of the child.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω το ει δυνη δυναϲαι παν δυνατα τω πι

**English Translation**
But he said to him: The 'if thou canst' be able; all things [are] possible to the [one] believing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He takes the father's tentative "if" and turns it back upon him. The limitation lies not in the power of the Healer ("be able"), but in the faith of the petitioner. He declares a universal law of the spirit: that omnipotence is accessible to the one who believes, removing the barrier of "if" from the divine side and placing it on the human heart.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και ευθυϲ κραξαϲ ο π του παιδιου ελε πιϲτευω βο μου τη απι

**English Translation**
And immediately crying out, the [father] of the child said: I believe; help my unbelief.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The father responds with an immediate cry, embodying the paradox of the human condition. He professes faith ("I believe") while simultaneously confessing his inadequacy ("help my unbelief"). He does not hide his weakness but brings it to the One who can heal both the spirit of the child and the doubt of the parent.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ο οτι ε ο οχλοϲ επετιμη τω τω α λεγων αυτω το αλαλον και κωφον εγω επιταϲϲω ϲοι ε εξ αυτου και μηκετι ειϲελ ειϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
But seeing that the crowd runs together, He rebuked the [unclean spirit], saying to it: The dumb and deaf [spirit], I command thee, come out of him and no longer enter into him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority of the command rests in the "I": "I command thee." It is not a request but a sovereign decree severing the bond between the unclean and the human vessel. The command forbids return, establishing a permanent liberation that the spirit cannot transgress, for the word of the One who commands binds the chaos of the deaf and dumb spirit.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και κραξαϲ και πολ ϲπαραξαϲ αυτ αυτ εξηλθεν και εγενετο ωϲει νεκροϲ ωϲτε τουϲ πολλουϲ λεγειν οτι απεθανεν

**English Translation**
And having cried out and much convulsed him, it came out; and he became as if dead, so that the many said that he died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The departure of the unclean is violent, for evil does not yield possession without a final assertion of its malice. The semblance of death marks the end of the old captivity, suggesting that true life often begins where the visible form appears utterly spent and emptied of its former oppressor.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ο δε κρατηϲαϲ τηϲ χιροϲ αυτου ηγει αυτον και α

**English Translation**
But He, having taken hold of his hand, raised him, and he [arose].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Touch conveys power; the hand that commands spirits also grasps human flesh to restore it. The act of raising him signifies a resurrection in miniature, where the one formerly cast down by demons now stands upright through the grip of the Deliverer.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲελθοντοϲ αυτου ειϲ οικον οι μαθηται αυτου κατ ϊδιαν επηρω αυτον · οτι η ουκ ηδυνηθη εκβαλειν αυ

**English Translation**
And upon His entering into a house, His disciples asked Him privately: Why were we not able to cast it out?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The privacy of the house allows for the confession of impotence. The disciples, having failed in public, seek the cause of their deficiency not in the power of the enemy, but in the lack within themselves, recognizing that authority is not mechanically possessed but spiritually sustained.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ τουτο το γενοϲ ε ουδενι δυνατε εξελθειν ει μη προϲευχη κ(αι) νηϲτεια

**English Translation**
And He said to them: This kind is able to come out in nothing except prayer and fasting.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There are depths of oppression which yield only to a total offering of the self to God. Prayer unites the will to the Divine, and fasting detaches the flesh from the world; only through this dual purification can the servant wield the power necessary to expel the most entrenched darkness.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
κακειθεν εξελθον παρεπορευον δια τηϲ γαλιλαι και ουκ ηθελ ϊνα τιϲ γνοι ·

**English Translation**
And going forth from there, they passed through Galilee, and He did not wish that anyone should know.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The withdrawal from the crowd signals a shift from public signs to private instruction. The journey through Galilee is cloaked in secrecy because the mystery now unfolding belongs to the inner circle, preparing them for a truth the multitude cannot yet bear.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
εδιδα γαρ τουϲ μα αυτου και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ ο ο του α πα ειϲ χι ανθρωπων και αποκτενου αυτον και α μετα τριϲ ημεραϲ ανα

**English Translation**
For He taught His disciples and said to them: The [Son] of [Man] [is delivered] into hands of men, and they will kill Him, and after three days He [will rise].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The teaching centers on the paradox of the Son of Man: ultimate power submitted to human hands. The prophecy of killing and rising defines the necessity of the passion, binding the hope of resurrection to the reality of death, a lesson the disciples must learn before the event unfolds.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ηγνοουν το ρημα και εφοβο αυτον επερω

**English Translation**
But they were ignorant of the saying and feared to ask Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ignorance breeds fear when the mind cannot grasp the necessity of suffering. Silence becomes a refuge for those who dread the confirmation of a hard truth, preferring the ambiguity of not knowing to the clarity of a predicted death.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και ηλθον ειϲ κα και τη οικια γενομε επηρωτα αυ τι εν τη οδω διελογιζεϲθε

**English Translation**
And they came into Capernaum; and being in the house He asked them: What were you reasoning in the way?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question exposes the disconnect between the Master's path to death and the disciples' earthly ambitions. He demands an account of their private thoughts, revealing that nothing reasoned "in the way" remains hidden from the One who leads the way.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
οι δε εϲιωπων · προϲ αλληλουϲ γαρ διε εν τη οδω τιϲ μειζων εϲτιν

**English Translation**
But they were silent; for with one another they disputed in the way who is greater.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Shame silences the ambitious when confronted by humility. Their dispute over greatness stands in stark judgment against the earlier prophecy of the Son of Man's submission, showing how far the hearts of the followers remain from the heart of the Leader.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και καθιϲαϲ εφω τουϲ · · και λεγει αυτοιϲ ει τιϲ θελει πρωτοϲ ει εϲτε εϲται παντ εϲχατοϲ και παν διακονοϲ

**English Translation**
And sitting down He called the [Twelve] and says to them: If anyone wishes to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True primacy is redefined as ultimate servitude. The seated posture indicates authoritative judgment, overturning the world's order by establishing that the only path to the heights of the Kingdom is the descent into service for the sake of all.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και λαβων παιδι παιδι εϲτηϲεν αυτο μεϲω αυτων και ειπ εναγκαλιϲα αυτο ειπ ειπ αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And taking a child, He set him in the midst of them, and having embraced him, said to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The visible sign of the child disrupts the disciples' contest for greatness. By placing the small and powerless in the center and embracing him, He identifies the reception of the least as the reception of the Greatest, grounding abstract theology in a concrete act of love.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
οϲ αν εν τ τ παιδιων τουτ δεξητε επι τω ο μου εμε δεχεται και οϲʼ ε δεχετε ουκ ε δεχετε αλλα τ τ αποϲτιλαντα με

**English Translation**
Whoever receives one of such children in my name receives me; and whoever receives me, does not receive me, but the one who sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We observe here the hierarchy of divine reception: the child, the Christ, and the Sender. The Lord establishes that humility acts as the gateway to the highest mysteries, for by bending low to accept the small and the simple in the Name, one unwittingly grasps the Infinite. The reception of the Son is not a terminus but a passage, leading the soul directly to the Father who sent Him.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο ϊωαν · διδαϲκαλε ειδομεν τινα τω ονοματι ϲου εκβαλλοντα δαι και εκω αυτον οτι ουκ ηκολου ημιν

**English Translation**
John said to him: Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we hindered him because he was not following us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Zeal for the visible fellowship often masks a jealousy that seeks to limit the operation of grace to one's own company. John confesses that the restriction was placed not because the work was evil, but because the worker walked not in their specific train. The power of the Name, however, operates by its own authority, independent of the human proximity of the disciples.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ειπω ενα ειπεν μη κωλυετε αυτον ουδιϲ γαρ εϲτιν οϲ ποιηϲει δυνα επι τω ονο μου και δυνη ταχυ κακολο με ·

**English Translation**
But he said, do not hinder him; for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and be able quickly to speak evil of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord prohibits the silencing of those who manifest His power, revealing a necessary concord between the act and the tongue. It is ontologically impossible for a soul to truly wield the authority of the Name in a mighty work while simultaneously reviling the Person of Christ. The working of the miracle itself binds the will, preventing immediate blasphemy.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ ου εϲτιν καθ ημ ϋπερ ημων εϲτ

**English Translation**
For whoever is not against us is for us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the spiritual warfare there is no neutral ground; one is either an adversary or an ally. By declaring that the absence of opposition constitutes support, the Lord expands the boundaries of His camp to include even those whose allegiance is nascent or distant, provided they do not stand in enmity against the truth.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ εαν ποτιϲη ϋμαϲ ποτηριον υδατοϲ εν ονομα μου οτι εμον εϲται αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι ου μη α τον μιϲθ αυτου

**English Translation**
For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are mine, amen I say to you that he will by no means lose his reward.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the smallest charity, when dignified by the Name and directed toward those belonging to Christ, acquires an eternal weight. The promise is absolute: the reward is secured not by the magnitude of the gift, but by the recognition of the Lord in the recipient. The water passes away, but the act, sealed by the Name, remains in the divine memory.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ αν ϲκανδα ενα των μι τουτων τω τ πιϲτευοντων κα εϲτιν αυτω μαλλον ει περικι μυλοϲ ονικοϲ περι τον τραχηλον αυτου και βεβλητε ειϲ την θαλαϲϲ θαλαϲϲ

**English Translation**
And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it is better for him if a donkey millstone is hung around his neck and he is thrown into the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The protection of the faithful simple ones is of such gravity that physical destruction is preferable to spiritual culpability. The image of the heavy stone and the depths of the sea signifies a judgment that removes the offender entirely from the community of the living, preventing the further infection of the body of believers.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και εαν ϲκανδαλι ϲε η χειρ ϲου απο αυτην καλ εϲτιν ϲε κυλλον ειϲελθειν ειϲ τ ζωην η ταϲ δυο χει εχοντα ειϲελ απελθειν ειϲ την γεεν ειϲ το πυρ το αϲβεϲτον ειϲ το πυρ το αϲβεϲτον

**English Translation**
And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go away into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The integrity of the body must be sacrificed for the integrity of the soul. The hand, the instrument of action, becomes an enemy if it serves sin; its severance is a mercy if it secures entrance into life. The repetition of the unquenchable nature of the fire underscores the terrifying permanence of the alternative to this radical self-discipline.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
και εαν ο πουϲ ϲου ϲκανδαλιζει ϲε · αποκοψον αυτ · καλον εϲτιν ϲε ειϲ την ζωην ειϲελ κυλλον · η χω · η τουϲ δυο πο εχοντα · ειϲ τ γεενναν βληθη ·

**English Translation**
And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than having two feet to be cast into Gehenna.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The foot, which bears the man on his path, must be removed if it walks toward destruction. It is a harsh economy of salvation where physical wholeness is traded for eternal safety. To be cast into Gehenna implies a passive judgment, a being thrown, which follows the active refusal to discipline one's own members.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
και εαν ο ο ϲου ϲκ ϲκ ϲε εκβαλε αυτον καλον ϲε εϲτιν μονοφθαλ ειϲελθιν ειϲ την ζω βαϲιλιαν του η δυ οφθαλμουϲ ε βληθηναι ειϲ την γεενναν

**English Translation**
And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out; it is better for you to enter one-eyed into the life kingdom of God than having two eyes to be cast into Gehenna.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eye, the lamp of the body and the gate of desire, must be plucked out if it leads the soul astray. The text here conjoins "life" and "kingdom," suggesting that the Kingdom of God is the only true life. The vision of God with one eye is infinitely superior to the vision of darkness with two.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
οπου ο ϲκωληξ αυτων ου τελευ και το πυρ ου ϲβεννυται

**English Translation**
Where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the description of the final state of the lost: internal corruption that never ceases and external torment that never fades. The worm signifies the gnawing of conscience which finds no end, and the fire signifies the pain that finds no relief. It is a death that is paradoxically and horribly alive.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
παϲ γαρ εν πυρι αλιϲθηϲε

**English Translation**
For everyone will be salted with fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fire is presented here not only as judgment but as a universal inevitability. Just as salt preserves and purifies, so too must every soul undergo a trial of fire. This salting implies a painful consecration, a stripping away of impurities so that what remains may be acceptable and seasoned for the divine purpose.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
καλον το αλαϲ · εαν δε το αλα αλαϲ αναλον γενηται εν τινι αυτο αρτυϲετε . εχετε εν εαυτοιϲ αλα αλαϲ και ιρηνευε ειρηνευετε εν αλληλοιϲ :

**English Translation**
Salt is good; but if the salt becomes saltless, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves and be at peace with one another.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciple must possess an internal quality of grace—the salt—that preserves the community from corruption. If this essential distinctiveness is lost, it cannot be restored from without. The command to have salt is immediately coupled with the command to peace, for true peace is not merely the absence of conflict but the presence of this preserving, purifying grace among the brethren.
