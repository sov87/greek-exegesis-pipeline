**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυναγονται προϲ αυτον οι φαριϲαιοι και τινεϲ των γραμ ελθον απο ϊεροϲολυ

**English Translation**
And there are gathered unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes having come from Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe how the centers of earthly authority, the Pharisees and scribes, converge from Jerusalem upon the true Temple, who is Christ. They gather not to worship but to scrutinize, bringing the weight of the holy city to bear against the Holy One. It is a centralization of judgment against the Judge, showing that proximity to the holy places of Jerusalem does not guarantee proximity to the will of God.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδοντεϲ τινεϲ τιναϲ των μαθη αυτου οτι κοι χερϲιν τουτ ε ανιπτοιϲ εϲ αρτον

**English Translation**
And having seen some of his disciples that with common hands, that is unwashed, they eat bread.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusers perceive the external act but miss the internal reality; they see "common" hands where there are sanctified hearts. By defining "common" strictly as "unwashed," they shackle holiness to water and flesh, failing to understand that bread eaten in the presence of the Word is sanctified not by the washing of hands, but by the company of the Lord.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
οι γαρ φαριϲαιοι κ(αι) παντεϲ οι ϊουδαι εαν μη πυκνα νιψωνται ταϲ χει ουκ εϲθιωϲιν κρατουντεϲ την πα των πρε

**English Translation**
For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash the hands often, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the universality of the burden: "all the Jews" are bound by a custom that is not of the Law but of the "elders." They fast not for piety but for ritual purity, making the act of eating contingent upon the act of washing. Thus, the "tradition" becomes a gatekeeper to sustenance, placing the rules of men as the prerequisite for receiving the gifts of creation.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και απο αγοραϲ εαν μη ραν ραντιϲωνται ουκ εϲθι και αλλα πολλα εϲτ α παρελαβον κρατ βαπτιϲμουϲ πο και ξεϲτ και χαλκιων

**English Translation**
And from the market, unless they sprinkle themselves, they do not eat; and many other things there are which they received to hold: baptisms of cups and jugs and copper vessels.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The marketplace, a site of necessary exchange, is viewed as a source of defilement requiring baptism—not of the soul, but of the body. Their zeal extends even to inanimate objects—cups and copper vessels—treating dead matter with a reverence due only to the living soul. This multiplication of baptisms drowns the conscience in "many other things," distracting from the one necessary washing of regeneration.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και επερωτωϲιν αυτον οι φαριϲαι και οι γραμματιϲ δια τι ου περιπατου οι μαθηται ϲου κατα την παραδοϲ των πρεϲβυτερ αλλα κοιναιϲ ανιτοιϲ χερϲ εϲθιουϲιν τον αρτ

**English Translation**
And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him: Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but with common, unwashed hands eat the bread?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation concerns the "walk," the manner of life, demanding conformity not to the commandments of God, but to the "tradition of the elders." They set "common" against "tradition," implying that to be outside their custom is to be profane. They attack the disciples to strike at the Master, questioning why the new freedom does not submit to the old yoke.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ κα επροφητευϲ ηϲαϊαϲ περι ϋμ των ωϲ γεγραπται οτι ου ο λαοϲ τοιϲ χιλε με τιμα η δε καρ αυτων πορρω απεχει απ εμου

**English Translation**
But he said to them: Well prophesied Isaiah concerning you, as it is written: That this people honors me with the lips, but their heart is far distant from me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord summons the prophet Isaiah to strip bare the pretense of their piety. He identifies the fatal severance: the honor of the lips, which is audible and public, versus the reality of the heart, which is hidden and distant. The "far distance" is not spatial but spiritual; one may be in the temple, chanting the psalms, yet dwell in a wasteland far from God.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ματην δε ϲεβοντε ϲεβονται με διδαϲκοντεϲ διδαϲκαλιαϲ ενταλ

**English Translation**
But in vain do they worship me, teaching teachings [as] commandments.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Worship becomes "vain"—empty and fruitless—when its content is forged by human authority. By elevating "teachings" of their own making to the status of divine "commandments," they usurp the throne of the Lawgiver. True doctrine is received, not invented; to teach one's own preferences as binding law is to worship a mirror rather than the Creator.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
αφεντεϲ την εντο του κρατει την παραδοϲ των

**English Translation**
Leaving the commandment of the [God], ye hold the tradition of the [men].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The exchange is stark and tragic: they engage in "leaving" the solid rock of the commandment to "hold" the shifting sand of tradition. The divine imperative is abandoned for the sake of human custom. It is an act of desertion, where the servant dictates the terms of service, grasping what is temporal while releasing what is eternal.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτοιϲ καλωϲ αθετιτε τ τ εντολην του ϊ την παραδοϲ παραδοϲ τηρηϲητε

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Well do ye reject the commandment of [God], that your tradition ye may keep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The irony is biting; he commends their skill in rebellion with the word "well." They have become experts in "rejecting" the divine will, not out of ignorance, but out of a calculated desire to "keep" what is their own. The preservation of their private custom requires the active destruction of God's law; the two cannot coexist in the same heart.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
μωϋϲηϲ γαρ ειπ ειπ τιμα τον π ϲου και την ϲου και ο κακολογ κακολογ η θανατω τελευτατω

**English Translation**
For Moses said: Honor thy father and thy [mother]; and he who speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Moses is brought forth as the witness against those who claim to uphold the elders. The commandment is twofold: positive honor and the negative prohibition against evil speech, sealed with the penalty of death. This establishes the sanctity of the origin of life in the parents, a sanctity which the law of God protects with the utmost severity, unlike the trivial traditions men invent.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ δε λεγεται ε ειπη τω η τη κορβ κορβ · ο εϲτιν δωρον ο εαν εξ εμου ωφε

**English Translation**
But ye say: If [a man] say to the father or the mother: Corban, that is a gift, whatever from me thou mightest be profited.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mechanism of their impiety: the word "Corban." By stamping material goods with a label of religious dedication ("a gift"), they construct a legal fiction to evade the natural and divine duty of supporting their parents. They cloak their greed in the language of sacrifice, using the altar of God as a shield against the commandment of love.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ουκετι α αυτον ουδ ουδ ποιηϲε ποιηϲαι τω · η τη

**English Translation**
No longer [do ye suffer] him to do anything for the [father] or the mother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tradition acts as a prohibition against charity. By their rules, they "no longer" permit the son to act as a son, effectively annulling the bond of blood and the debt of gratitude. They have legislated a barrier between the child and the parent, ensuring that the "tradition" of the elders destroys the very foundation of the family established by God.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ακυρουντεϲ τον λογον του τη παραδοϲι υμ υμ η παρεδωκατε και παρομοια πολ τοιαυτα ποιειτε :

**English Translation**
Invalidating the word of [Him] by the tradition of you of you which you delivered; and many such similar things you do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text presents a stark opposition between the divine Word and the human delivery. The reduplication "of you of you" exposes the intense, possessive egoism inherent in these traditions; men claim ownership of the law so fiercely that they displace the authority of the One who gave it.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲα παλιν τον οχλον ελεγεν αυ ακουετε και ϲυνϊετε

**English Translation**
And having called again the crowd he was saying to them: Hear and understand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The summons to the crowd is renewed, linking the physical act of hearing with the intellectual act of understanding. Mere auditory reception of the teaching is insufficient; the command requires the listener to grasp the inner sense of the declaration.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ουδεν ε εξωθεν του ανου ειϲπορευο επ ειϲ αυτ ο δυναται κοινω αυτον αλλα τα εκ του α εκπο εϲτιν τα κοιναυντα κοινουντα κοινουντα τ ανον

**English Translation**
Nothing is outside the man entering into him which is able to defile him, but the things proceeding out of the man are the things defiling defiling defiling the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe’s threefold repetition of "defiling" emphasizes the gravity of internal corruption. While external matter entering the body is powerless to taint the soul, the effluent of the human will is the true and persistent source of pollution.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και οτε ειϲηλθον ειϲ τον οικον απο του οχλου επηρω αυτον οι μα αυτου την παραβολην

**English Translation**
And when they entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples were asking him [about] the parable.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Withdrawal from the multitude is necessary for deeper instruction. The house functions as a place of intimate revelation, where those committed to following the Teacher may interrogate the mystery that the crowd merely heard.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ ου ουτωϲ και ϋμιϲ αϲυνε εϲτε ουπω νοει οτι παν το εξω ειϲπορευομε ου κοινοι τ ανον

**English Translation**
And he says to them: So also you are without understanding? Do you not yet perceive that everything entering from outside does not defile the man?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rebuke places the chosen disciples on the same level as the uncomprehending crowd. The fundamental principle is established: material substance from the exterior world lacks the moral agency required to affect the spiritual nature of the man.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
οτι ουκ ειϲ αυτου ειϲ την καρδιαν αλλ ειϲ την κοιλιαν και ειϲ τον αφεδρωνα εκ καθαρι παντα τα βρω ·

**English Translation**
Because it does not enter into of him into the heart, but into the belly, and into the latrine goes out, cleansing all the foods.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A strict physiological distinction is drawn between the heart, the seat of the will, and the belly, the vessel of digestion. The natural cycle of consumption and excretion purges the physical matter, leaving the heart untouched by the food itself.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε οτι το εκ του α εκπο εκι κοινοι τον

**English Translation**
And he was saying that the thing proceeding out of the man, that defiles the [man].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demonstrative "that" isolates the specific origin of impurity. It is not the man's environment but his own output—that which originates from his being—which renders him common or unclean.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
εϲωθεν γαρ εκ τηϲ καρδιαϲ των οι διαλογιϲμοι οι κακοι εκπορευ πορνιαι κλοπαι φονοι

**English Translation**
For from within, out of the heart of the [ones], the evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heart is identified as the laboratory of vice. Before the visible acts of theft or murder occur, they exist as "evil thoughts" proceeding from the interior; the thought is the seed of the deed.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
μοιχιαι πλεονεξιαι πονηριαι δολοϲ αϲελγια οφθαλμοϲ πονηροϲ βλαϲφημια ϋπερηφανια αφροϲυνη

**English Translation**
adulteries, covetousnesses, wickednesses, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This catalog unifies sins of the flesh with sins of the spirit. Pride and foolishness stand alongside adultery, demonstrating that the corruption of the heart manifests as much in arrogance and lack of wisdom as in carnal indulgence.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
παντα ταυτα τα πο εϲωθεν εκ κακει κοινοι τον αν

**English Translation**
All these the evil things from within [come] out and that defiles the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The universality of "all these evil things" confirms the capacity of the human interior for total depravity. The movement is strictly outward; the defilement is an export of the soul, not an import of the body.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
εκειθεν δε αναϲταϲ απηλθεν ειϲ τα ο τυρου και ϲιδω και ειϲελθ ειϲ οικιαν ουδε ηθεληϲεν γνω και ουκ ηδυνα λαλειν λαθειν

**English Translation**
And from there rising up he went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and having entered into a house he wished no one to know, and he was not able to speak to be hidden.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord seeks seclusion in Gentile lands, yet his presence cannot be contained. The text offers a paradox where he is unable "to speak to be hidden," suggesting that his very nature as the Word makes true concealment impossible, even when silence is intended.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
αλλα ευθυϲ ακου γυνη περι αυ · ηϲ ειχεν το θυ ακα ειϲελθου προϲεπεϲεν προϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ αυ

**English Translation**
But immediately a woman having heard concerning him, whose the little daughter had [an unclean spirit], having entered, fell at his feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The immediacy of the woman's approach disrupts the Lord's privacy. Her entry, driven by the condition of her daughter, brings the reality of the "unclean" directly to the feet of the One who defined true purity, seeking mercy where he sought solitude.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
η δε γυνη ην ελλη ϲυροφοινικιϲ τω γενι και η αυτον ϊνα το δαιμονιον εκ εκ τηϲ θυγα αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race; and she asked him that he cast the demon out of her daughter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the specific delineation of the supplicant's origin; she is called a Greek and a Syrophoenician, marking her as distinct from the covenant people by both culture and blood. Yet, the urgency of the maternal bond transcends these barriers, for the torment of the daughter compels the mother to approach the source of grace. The text repeats the preposition of expulsion ("out out"), emphasizing the desperate necessity for the demon to be utterly removed from the vessel it has defiled.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν αυτη α πρωτον χορ τα τεκνα ου γαρ εϲτιν καλ λαβειν τον αρτ των τεκνων και τοιϲ κυναριοιϲ βα

**English Translation**
And he said to her, Let first be satisfied the children; for it is not good to take the bread of the children and cast it to the little dogs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord establishes the divine order of salvation, prioritizing the "children"—the House of Israel—who are the rightful heirs to the nourishment of the Word. The "bread" signifies the blessings and presence of God, which must not be carelessly scattered. By using the term "little dogs," He tests the depth of her humility, drawing a sharp distinction between those within the household of faith and those without, yet implying that even the latter have a relation, however small, to the master of the house.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
η δε απεκριθη και λεγει αυτω ναι και τα κυναρια ε αποτ̣ατω ϋποκατω τηϲ τραπεζηϲ α των ψιχιων των παιδιων

**English Translation**
But she answered and says to him, Yes, and the little dogs under the table eat from the crumbs of the children.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is wisdom found in a Gentile heart: she does not deny the priority of the children nor her own lowly status, but rather claims the position assigned to her. By accepting the place "under the table," she transforms the insult into an argument for mercy, recognizing that the abundance of the Master's table is such that even the fragments—the "crumbs"—possess power sufficient for her need. She understands that the surplus of grace is inexhaustible.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτη δι τουτον τον λογ ϋπαγε εξεληλυθ εκ τηϲ θυγατροϲ ϲου το δεμονιον δαιμονιον ·

**English Translation**
And he said to her, Because of this word, go; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord attributes the miracle specifically to "this word" (logos) which she spoke. It is her confession of faith, articulated with humility and wit, that unlocks the treasury of healing. The duplication of "demon" in the text reinforces the totality of the exorcism; the evil spirit is named and dismissed solely on the strength of her faithful reply, proving that faith acts at a distance and requires no physical proximity to the afflicted.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και απελθουϲα ειϲ τον οικον εαυτηϲ ευρεν το παιδι βεβλημενον επι την κλινην και το δαιμονιον εξελη

**English Translation**
And having gone away to her house, she found the child cast upon the bed and the demon gone out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Upon her return, the evidence of the miracle is twofold: the absence of the oppressor and the repose of the victim. The child is found "cast upon the bed," indicating a state of exhaustion and peace following the violent departure of the spirit. The "going out" of the demon is a completed reality, verified in the quiet of the home, confirming that the divine command operates instantly and invisibly across space.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και παλιν εξελθ εκ των οριων τυ ηλθεν δια ϲι ειϲ την θα τηϲ γαλι ανα μεϲον των οριων δεκα

**English Translation**
And again having gone out from the borders of Tyre, he came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, into the midst of the borders of Decapolis.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The itinerary of the Lord weaves through the territories of the Gentiles, moving from Tyre through Sidon and down to the Decapolis. This circuitous path "into the midst" of the Ten Cities signifies the sowing of the Gospel in soil traditionally considered unclean. He does not shun the boundaries of the nations but traverses them, preparing the earth for the universal calling that is to come.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και φερουϲιν αυ κωφον και μο και παρα αυτον επιθη αυτω ταϲ χιραϲ την χιρα

**English Translation**
And they bring to him a deaf and speech-impaired man, and beseech him to lay upon him the hand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The community acts as the intercessor for the one who cannot hear or speak for himself. The description of the man as "speech-impaired" (mogilalon) suggests a difficulty in articulation stemming from his deafness. Their request for the laying on of the "hand" demonstrates a belief in the transmission of power through physical contact, viewing the body of the Lord as the instrument of divine restoration.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και απολαβομενοϲ αυτον κατ ϊδιαν α του οχλου ελα εβαλεν τουϲ δακτυλουϲ ειϲ τα ωτα αυτου και πτυϲαϲ ηψατο τηϲ γλωϲϲηϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
And having taken him aside privately from the crowd, he put his fingers into his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Separation from the tumult of the crowd is necessary for this intimate operation of grace. The Lord uses physical signs—fingers in ears, spittle on the tongue—to communicate with the man who lacks the faculty of hearing. By inserting His fingers, He supplies the blocked passage; by the moisture of His own mouth, He loosens the dryness of the bound tongue, showing that His very flesh is life-giving.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και αναβλεψαϲ ειϲ τον ο εϲτε και λεγει αυτω εφφαθα εφφεθα εφφαθα ο εϲτιν διανυχθη

**English Translation**
And looking up to heaven, he groaned and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The upward gaze directs all glory to the Father, indicating the source of power. The groan signifies the Lord's profound empathy with human suffering and the weight of the flesh He has assumed. The preservation of the Aramaic command "Ephphatha"—repeated in the text as if to capture the precise utterance—underscores the authority of the original voice. "Be opened" is a command addressed not merely to the organ of hearing, but to the whole person, that they may receive the mysteries of God.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και ηνυγηϲαν αυ αι ακοαι και ευ ελυθη ο δεϲμοϲ τηϲ γλωϲϲηϲ αυτου και ελαλει ορθωϲ

**English Translation**
And his hearing was opened, and immediately the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke rightly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The opening of the ears leads directly to the loosening of the tongue; one cannot speak the truth of God until one has first heard it. The "bond" which held his speech captive is dissolved by the Creator's word. That he spoke "rightly" (orthōs) implies not only clear articulation but correct understanding; the restoration of the faculties results in the proper praise of the Creator.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και διεϲτιλατο αυ · μηδενι λε οϲον δε αυτοιϲ δι αυτοι μαλλον περιϲϲο εκηρυϲϲ

**English Translation**
And he charged them that they should tell no one; but as much as he charged them, they the more abundantly preached it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The injunction to silence serves to temper the excitement of the flesh and focus the heart on the spiritual reality of the sign. Yet, the magnitude of the miracle makes obedience to this command impossible for them; the goodness of God cannot be concealed. Their disobedience in "preaching" proceeds from an overflow of gratitude, illustrating that the works of Light inevitably dispel the darkness of secrecy.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και εξεπληϲϲοντο λεγοντεϲ καλωϲ παντα πεποιηκ και τουϲ κωφουϲ ποιει ακουειν και αλαλουϲ λαλ

**English Translation**
And they were astonished, saying, He has done all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd's astonishment culminates in a verdict that echoes the first creation: "He has done all things well." This confession recognizes the restoration of human nature to its intended goodness. By making the deaf hear and the speechless speak, the Lord fulfills the prophetic signs of the Messianic age, revealing Himself as the one who restores the broken communication between God and man.
