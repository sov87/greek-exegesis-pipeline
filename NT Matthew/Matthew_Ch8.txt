**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
καταβαντι δε αυτω καταβαντοϲ δε αυτου απο του ορουϲ ηκο αυτω οχλοι πολλοι

**English Translation**
And to Him having come down, and He having come down from the mountain, followed Him crowds many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Spirit records the descent twice to signify the dual nature of this coming down. First, He descends in the dative, appearing *to* the world; second, He descends in the genitive absolute, establishing the historical reality of the movement from the mountain. He comes down from the height of divine legislation to the plain of human suffering, and only when He lowers Himself do the many crowds follow.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου λεπροϲ προϲ προϲεκυ αυτω λεγων εαν θεληϲ δυ με καθαρι

**English Translation**
And behold, a leper toward, worshipped Him, saying, "If You will, You [can] cleanse me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The leper moves "toward," yet the text halts, emphasizing his approach before describing his worship. He does not demand the healing but submits to the will, confessing that power resides inherently in the Lord. He seeks the cleansing of his nature, not merely the relief of his flesh, binding the act of worship to the recognition of sovereign will.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και εκτιναϲ τ χειρα αυτου αυτου ηψατο αυτου λεγων θελω καθαριϲθητι και ε ευθεωϲ εκαθαριϲθη αυτου η λεπρα

**English Translation**
And having stretched out the hand of Him, of Him He touched him, saying, "I will; be cleansed." And i-immediately was cleansed of him the leprosy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text repeats "of Him" and "He touched him," pressing the reality of the contact. The pure touches the impure, yet does not contract defilement; rather, the "I will" drives out the disease. The immediacy of the cleansing, marked by the stutter of the text, demonstrates that the effect follows the divine command without the delay of time or natural process.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν λεγι αυτω ο ορα μηδε ειπηϲ αλλα ϲεαυτον διξον τω ϊερει και προϲε το δωρον ο προϲεταξεν μω ειϲ μαρτυρι αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And said, He says to him, "[See that] to no one you speak; but show yourself to the priest and offer the gift which Mo[ses] commanded, for a testimony to them."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks and "says," a double utterance confirming the gravity of the command to silence. He directs the cleansed man to the priest and to the law of Moses, validating the old covenant even as He demonstrates power superior to it. The healing serves as a testimony *to* them, a witness against their unbelief should they deny the work of God.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ειϲελθοντοϲ δε αυ ειϲ καφαρναουμ προϲηλθεν αυτω εκατονταρχηϲ εκατονταρχοϲ πα αυτον

**English Translation**
And He having entered into Capharnaum, approached Him a centurion, a centurion be[seeching] Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rank of the man is stated twice, "centurion, centurion," underlining his Gentile authority and the significance of his humility. He enters not with a command but with a plea. The double naming affirms that even those holding the sword of earthly empire must eventually approach the Lord of Capharnaum to find true relief.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και λεγων ο παιϲ μου βεβληται εν τη οικια παραλυτι δινωϲ βαϲα

**English Translation**
And saying, "The boy of me is cast in the house, paralytic, terribly tor[mented]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The centurion lays bare the suffering of his servant, described as "cast" down. The paralysis is coupled with terrible torment, a paradox where the body cannot move yet suffers the agitation of pain. He presents the affliction without prescribing the remedy, trusting the mere hearing of the Lord is sufficient to evoke mercy.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και λε αυτω ακολουθι μοι εγω ελθων θε αυτον

**English Translation**
And He says to him, "Follow Me; I, coming, will heal him."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is a mystery of the text: the Lord commands "Follow Me" before promising "I, coming, will heal." The healing of the servant is contingent upon the discipleship of the master. The Lord invites the centurion not merely to receive a miracle but to walk the path of obedience; only then does He promise to come and cure the affliction.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε κ(αι) αποκριθειϲ κ(αι) αποκριθειϲ ο ε εκατονταρχοϲ ει εφη εφη ουκ ειμι ϊ ϊνα μου την ϲτεγην ει αλλα μον ειπε λογω και ϊα ο παιϲ μου

**English Translation**
And answering, and answering, and answering, the c-centurion said, said, "I am not w-worthy that under my roof You should en[ter]; but on-only speak with a word, and hea[led shall be] the boy of me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The threefold repetition of "answering" reveals the profound trembling and hesitation of the Gentile soul before the Holy One. He stammers "said, said," overcome by his unworthiness. He recognizes that the physical presence of the Lord is too great for his roof, yet he possesses the supreme faith that the Lord's "word" alone holds the power of presence, capable of healing from afar.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και γαρ εγω ει ϋπο εξουϲιαν ταϲϲομενοϲ εχ εχ ϋπ εμαυτον ϲτρα και λεγω τουτω πορευθητι και πορευετε και αλλω ερχου και ερ και τω δουλω μου ποιηϲον του και ποιει ·

**English Translation**
"For even I am [a man] under authority appointed, having, having under myself sold[iers]; and I say to this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he com[es]; and to the servant of me, 'Do th[is],' and he does."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The centurion understands the hierarchy of power. He says "having, having," emphasizing his possession of earthly command to illustrate a spiritual truth. If a human word compels the obedience of soldiers and servants, how much more does the divine Word command the forces of nature and disease? He confesses Christ as the supreme Commander of the cosmos.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ο ε και ει τοιϲ ακολου αμην λε ουδε εν τω ι τοϲαυτην πιϲτιν ευρον

**English Translation**
And hearing, He and said to those follow[ing], "Amen I sa[y], neither in I[srael] such faith did I find."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord turns to those "following"—the very act He demanded of the centurion in the seventh verse. He declares that this faith, found outside the covenantal bounds of Israel, surpasses what is found within. It is a faith that relies entirely on the authority of the Word, without demanding signs, presence, or contact, shaming the chosen people who require sight to believe.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
λεγω δε ϋμιν οτι πολλοι απο ανατο · και δυϲμ ηξουϲιν και ανα με αβρααμ και ϊϲακ και ϊακωβ εν τη βαϲιλεια των ου

**English Translation**
And I say to you that many from ea[st] and wes[t] will come and rec[line] with Abraam and Isak and Iakob in the kingdom of the heav[ens].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gathering is universal, drawing from the rising and setting sun. These "many" are the Gentiles who exhibit the faith of the centurion. They do not merely stand but "recline" in rest and fellowship with the patriarchs—Abraam, Isak, and Iakob—inheriting the promises of the kingdom not by lineage, but by the faith that acknowledges the power of the Lord from afar.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ϋϊοι τηϲ βαϲιλειαϲ εκβλη εξελευϲονται ειϲ το ϲκοτοϲ το εξωτε · εκει εϲτε ο κλαυ και ο βρυγ των οδοντ

**English Translation**
But the sons of the kingdom cast [out] will go out into the darkness the oute[r]; there shall b[e] the weeping and the gnash[ing] of the teet[h].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying double judgment is recorded: they are "cast out" and yet they "will go out." They are expelled by divine decree, yet they also depart by their own will, having rejected the light. They move into the "outer darkness," a place defined by the absence of the King, where the physical reaction of weeping and gnashing teeth signifies the eternal regret of those who held the title of sons but lacked the faith of servants.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ο τω εκατονταρχη εκατονταρχω εκατονταρχη ϋπα ωϲ επιϲτευϲαϲ γενηθητω ϲοι και ϊαθη ο παιϲ εν τη ωρα εκεινη και ϋ ο εκατ ειϲ τον οι αυτου εν αυτη τη ωρα ευρεν τ παιδα ϋγιαινοντα και ϋποϲτρεψαϲ ο εκατ ειϲ τον οικον αυτου εν αυτη τη ωρα ευρεν τ παιδα ϋγιαινοντα

**English Translation**
And He said to the centurion centurion centurion, Go, as you believed let it happen to you; and the boy was healed in that hour. And returning the centurion into his house in that very hour found the boy being healthy. And returning the centurion into his house in that very hour found the boy being healthy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text presents a singular emphasis on the rank of the petitioner, naming him thrice to underscore the magnitude of authority submitting to the Divine command. The narrative of the return and the finding of the healthy boy is set down twice; this doubling serves as a firm seal upon the miracle. By stating the confirmation of the healing a second time, the Scripture precludes any doubt, establishing the reality of the cure in the very hour the Word was spoken. The faith of the man and the health of the boy stand verified by this twofold witness of the text.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και ελθων ο ειϲ την οικιαν πετρου ειδεν την πενθε αυτου βεβλη και πυρεϲ

**English Translation**
And He, having come into the house of Peter, saw his mother-in-law cast down and fevering.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He enters the domestic space of Peter, and His gaze immediately falls upon the affliction within. The woman is described as "cast down," a posture of helplessness that the fever imposes upon the body. The text identifies the malady and the posture together to show the totality of her incapacitation before the Lord approaches. The sickness has laid her low, awaiting the One who lifts up.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και ηψατο τηϲ χιροϲ αυτηϲ και αφηκεν αυτ αυτ ο πυρετοϲ και εγερ ηγερθη κ(αι) διηκονι αυτοιϲ αυτω̣

**English Translation**
And He touched her hand, and the fever left her her, and she arose arose, and ministered to them to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The contact of the Divine hand brings immediate liberation, emphasized by the repetition that the fever left her. The response of the woman is equally emphatic; the text states twice that she arose, marking the completeness of her restoration from the bed of sickness. Her service is directed "to them to him," encompassing both the company present and the Healer specifically. Service follows instantly upon healing; she does not linger in recovery but moves directly into the diaconate of the household.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
οψιαϲ δε γενομε προϲηνεγκ προϲηνεγκ αυτω δαιμονιζο πολλουϲ και εξεβαλεν τα λογω και παν τουϲ κακωϲ ε εθεραπευϲ

**English Translation**
And evening having come, they brought they brought to Him many demon-possessed; and He cast out the [spirits] with a word, and all those having badly He healed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the people is captured in the doubled statement "they brought they brought," suggesting a relentless gathering of the afflicted as the day waned. He meets this multitude of possessed and suffering ones not with elaborate ritual, but with a single word. The text distinguishes between the casting out of the internal oppressor and the healing of those in a bad state, showing His dominion over both spiritual captivity and physical decay.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
οπωϲ πληρωθη το ρηθεν δια ηϲαϊου του προφητου λε αυτοϲ ταϲ αϲθενιαϲ ημων ελαβεν και ταϲ νο εβαϲταϲεν

**English Translation**
So that might be fulfilled that spoken through Esaias the prophet saying, He Himself took our infirmities and bore the diseases.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The healing acts are not merely works of power but fulfillments of prophetic necessity. Esaias is cited to ground the ministry of relief in the ancient promise. The text asserts that He "took" and "bore" these burdens; He does not simply wave them away but assumes the weight of human frailty. The infirmities and diseases of the people find their resolution in His person.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ο πολλουϲ οχλουϲ περι αυτον εκελευ απελθειν ειϲ το περαν

**English Translation**
And He, seeing many crowds around Him, commanded to depart to the beyond.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sight of the "many crowds" prompts a movement away rather than an embrace of popularity. He commands a departure "to the beyond," signifying a transition from the place of gathering to a place of crossing. The authority to command the departure rests with Him who sees the true nature of the multitude and directs His course according to a divine purpose, not human acclaim.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων ειϲ γραμματευϲ ειπ αυτω διδαϲκαλε ακολουθηϲω ϲοι οπου εαν απερχη

**English Translation**
And approaching, one scribe said to Him, Teacher, I will follow You wherever You might depart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A single scribe separates himself to make a profession of loyalty, addressing Him as "Teacher." The scribe pledges to follow "wherever," assuming a readiness for any destination. This offer of adherence is absolute in word, yet it proceeds from a man accustomed to the stability of the text and the school, now confronting the itinerant reality of the Living Word.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτω ο αι αλωπεκεϲ φω εχουϲιν και τα πετινα του ο καταϲκηνω ο δε ϋϊοϲ του αν ουκ εχι που την κεφαλ κλινη ·

**English Translation**
And He says to him, The foxes have holes and the birds of the [heaven] nests, but the Son of Man has not where He might recline the head.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He contrasts the settled nature of the wild creatures with His own lack of earthly repose. The foxes and birds possess their own places of rest, provided by the Creator, yet the Son of Man, in His humiliation, owns no place to lay His head. He strips away any illusion of comfort for the would-be follower; to follow Him is to embrace a homelessness that exceeds even that of the beasts.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ετεροϲ δε των μα ειπεν αυ επιτρεψον μοι πρωτον απελ και θαψε τον μου

**English Translation**
And another of the disciples said to Him, Permit me first to depart and to bury the [one] of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This disciple, unlike the scribe, is already counted among the learners, yet he seeks permission to prioritize a departure. He asks to bury "the [one] of me," a phrase focusing intensely on his personal loss and obligation to kin. The request places the duty to the dead "first," positing a delay in the immediate following of the Lord.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ο δε λεγι αυτω ακο μοι και αφεϲ τουϲ νεκρουϲ θα τουϲ εαυτων νεκρουϲ

**English Translation**
But He says to him, Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "Follow Me" overrides the petition for delay. He establishes a sharp division between the life of discipleship and the sphere of the dead. Those who are not following are accounted as dead themselves, fit only for the task of burying the dead. The call to follow requires a total severance from the obligations that bind one to the cycle of mortality.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και εμβαντι αυτω ειϲ το το πλοιον ηκο αυτω οι μαθητε αυτου

**English Translation**
And He having embarked into the the boat, His disciples followed Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act of embarking is doubled in the text by the repetition of the article "the the boat," emphasizing the specific vessel of their transit. The disciples' action is defined by "followed Him"; they enter into the same enclosure and the same peril as their Master. Their presence in the boat is the physical enactment of the command to follow, placing them in the direct company of the Lord upon the waters.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ϲιϲμοϲ μεγαϲ εγενετο εν τη θαλαϲϲη ωϲτε το πλοιον καλυπτε ϋπο των κυμα αυτοϲ δε εκα

**English Translation**
And behold, a great quake happened in the sea, so as the boat to be covered by the waves; but He was sleeping.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "quake" in the sea creates a chaos great enough to overwhelm the vessel, hiding it beneath the waves. In the midst of this violent covering, the text presents the singular calm of the Lord: "He was sleeping." His repose stands in absolute contrast to the upheaval of the elements. While the boat is swallowed by the sea, He remains untouched by the terror, resting in the sovereignty that precedes His waking power.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και προϲ ηγιραν αυτον λεγοντεϲ ϲωϲον απολλυ

**English Translation**
And they came and raised him, saying: Save, [we] perish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the brevity of the plea. In the face of the overwhelming storm, the disciples do not waste words on titles or elaborate prayers; they cry out the essential need: "Save." The text ends abruptly with "perish" (apollu), cutting off the full grammatical form, mimicking the very breath being snatched away by the waves. This teaches us that the Lord hears even the fragmented cry of the soul on the brink of destruction.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και λεγι αυτοιϲ τι δι εϲτε ολιγοπιϲ τοτε εγερθιϲ ε τω α τοιϲ ανεμοιϲ και τη θαλ και εγενε γαληνη μεγαλη

**English Translation**
And he says to them: Why are ye fearful, O little-faiths? Then having risen he rebuked the winds and the sea; and there became a great calm.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He addresses the internal storm of fear before the external storm of wind. By naming them "little-faiths," he diagnoses the root of their terror: they looked at the waves rather than the One sleeping in the boat. The sequence is sovereign: first the word of instruction to the men, then the rising, then the rebuke to the elements. The "great calm" corresponds inversely to the great agitation of their hearts, proving that peace is a command of the Creator, not merely a cessation of wind.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
οι δε εθαυμα λεγοντεϲ πο εϲτιν ουτοϲ οτι και οι ανεμοι και η θαλαϲϲα αυ υπακουουϲ

**English Translation**
But the [men] marveled, saying: Of what sort is this [man], that even the winds and the sea obey him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question "Of what sort is this?" reveals that his power does not fit into their existing categories of prophets or kings. Mere men beg the elements; this Man commands them, and they listen as servants to a master. The marveling here is the beginning of a new understanding, where the boundaries of the natural world are seen to be subject to his voice.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντων αυ ελθοντοϲ αυτου ειϲ το περ ειϲ την χωραν τ γαζαρηνων γεργεϲηνων υπ αυτω δυο δεμονιζομενοι δαιμονιζομενοι · εκ των μνημι εξερχομενοι χα λιαν ωϲτε μη ϊϲχυειν τινα παρελθειν δια τηϲ οδου εκινηϲ

**English Translation**
And when they came—when he came—to the other side, into the country of the Gazarenes Gergesenes, there met him two demon-possessed [men], coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one was strong [enough] to pass through that way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text struggles with the location, correcting "Gazarenes" to "Gergesenes," yet the spiritual geography is clear: it is a place of death. The demoniacs dwell in the tombs, signifying that those under the power of the enemy are already dead while living. Their fierceness blocks the path, showing how evil seeks to obstruct the "way" of commerce and communion between men. He who calmed the sea now steps onto land to confront a fiercer storm in the souls of men.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου εκραξαν λε τι ημιν κ(αι) ϲοι ϋϊε του ηλθεϲ ωδε ημαϲ απολε προ καιρου προ καιρου βαϲανιϲαι ημαϲ

**English Translation**
And behold, they cried out, saying: What to us and to thee, Son of the [One]? Camest thou here to destroy us before the time—before the time to torment us?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demons recognize what the disciples in the boat only wondered at. They name him "Son of the," implying the Highest, acknowledging his lineage. Their double cry regarding "before the time" (pro kairou) exposes their knowledge of an appointed judgment. They fear the "torment" and "destruction" that is their inevitable fate, and they tremble that the Judge has arrived early to execute the sentence.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ην δε μακραν α αυτων αγελη χοιρων πολλων βοϲκομενη

**English Translation**
Now there was far from them a herd of many swine feeding.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of swine indicates a land outside the law of holiness, a fitting backdrop for this confrontation. They are "far off," a distance that symbolizes the separation between the clean and the unclean. Yet, even this distance is not great enough to hide from the presence of the Holy One who has landed on their shores.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
οι δε δαιμονεϲ πα αυτ αυτ λεγοντεϲ ει εκβαλ ημαϲ αποϲτι ημαϲ ειϲ την αγελην των χοι

**English Translation**
And the demons besought him, saying: If thou cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Evil seeks a dwelling place; it cannot bear to be naked before God. By asking to enter the swine, the demons reveal their affinity for uncleanness. They bargain for a lesser judgment—exile into beasts—rather than the immediate abyss. They acknowledge his authority to "cast out" and "send," confirming that they have no power except what is permitted to them.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυ ϋπαγετε οι δε εξελθοντεϲ απηλθον ειϲ τουϲ χοιρουϲ και ϊδου ωρμηϲεν παϲα η αγελη κατα του κρη ειϲ την θα και απε απεθαναν εν τοιϲ ϋδα

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Go. And having come out, they went away into the swine; and behold, all the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and died in the waters.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
One word, "Go," is sufficient to liberate the men and condemn the swine. The rush into the sea demonstrates the destructive nature of the demonic; given license, they drive their hosts to immediate ruin. The waters, which recently threatened the disciples, now serve as the grave for the unclean herd, swallowing up the visible manifestation of the impurity that plagued the land.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
οι δε βοϲκον εφυγον και απελθοντεϲ ειϲ την πολιν απηγ παντα και τα των δαιμονι

**English Translation**
And those feeding [them] fled, and having gone away into the city, reported all things, and the things of the demoniacs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The herdsmen become evangelists of fear rather than joy. They report "all things," including the miracle of the demoniacs, yet their reaction is flight. They value the loss of their property more than the restoration of two human souls. It is a testimony against them that they saw the power of God but ran to the city to spread alarm rather than falling at his feet.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και ϊ παϲα η πολιϲ εξηλθεν ειϲ ϋπ του και ειδοντεϲ αυτον παρεκαλεϲαν ο μεταβη απο των οριων αυτ

**English Translation**
And behold, all the city came out to meet [him]; and having seen him, they besought [him] that he would depart from their borders.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A tragic procession: the whole city comes out, not to welcome the Savior, but to expel him. They see him—the text is explicit—yet their prayer is for his departure. They prefer the security of their borders and their economy to the disturbing presence of Divine power. He saved them from the terror of the demoniacs, but they found the Healer more terrifying than the demons.
