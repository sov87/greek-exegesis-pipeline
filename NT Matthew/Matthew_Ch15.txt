**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲερχοντε τω απο ϊεροϲο φαριϲαι και γραμματειϲ λεγοντεϲ

**English Translation**
Then come to the [One] from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes saying.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We observe the centralization of opposition; the Pharisees and scribes do not merely arise from the countryside but descend from Jerusalem, the seat of religious authority. They approach the One—indicated here only by the article—signaling that He has become the focal point of their scrutiny. Their movement is a unified confrontation against the authority present in Him.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
δια τι οι μαθητε ϲου παρα την παρα των πρεϲ ου γαρ νιπτονται ταϲ χι χειραϲ οταν αρτον εϲ

**English Translation**
Why [do] the disciples of you [go beside] the [tradition] of the elders? For they do not wash the hands whenever bread they [eat].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusation rests not on the Law of God but on the disciples "going beside" the tradition of the elders. The text stammers on "hands," emphasizing the physical, external nature of their obsession. They bind the act of eating bread to a ritual cleansing not commanded by Scripture, elevating human custom to the status of necessary law.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει αυτοιϲ δια τι κ(αι) ϋμειϲ παραβενε την εντολην του δια την πα ϋμων

**English Translation**
But answering he said to them, Why also [do] you transgress the commandment of the [One] because of the tradition of yours?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He answers a charge of neglecting tradition with a counter-charge of transgressing the commandment of the One. The contrast is stark: the disciples neglect the elders, but the accusers neglect the divine Commander. Their tradition is not merely an addition but a cause of stumbling, for "because of" it, they step across the boundary of God's law.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
ο γαρ ενετιλατο λε ειπεν ενετιλατο λεγων τιμα τον π και την και ο κακολογων π η μ μ θανατω τελευτατω

**English Translation**
For the [One] commanded [saying] said commanded saying, Honor the father and the [mother], and he who speaks evil of father or mother [mother] let him end in death.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text forcefully iterates the divine authority, repeating "commanded" and "said" to leave no doubt of the source. The command to honor the father and the mother is absolute, and the penalty for speaking evil is severe. The stuttering repetition of "mother" at the end of the prohibition underscores the gravity of the offense against the one who gave life; to revoke honor is to invite death.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ϋμιϲ δε λεγετε οϲ ειπη τω η τη δωρον ο εαν εξ ε ωφεληθηϲ ουδεν εϲτιν

**English Translation**
But you say, Whoever says to the [father] or the [mother], A gift whatever from me you might be profited, is nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mechanism of their evasion: by declaring their property a "gift" (dedicated to the temple), they claim the obligation to the parent "is nothing." They use the language of piety to nullify the debt of love owed to the father and mother, transforming a holy duty into a void.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ου μη τιμηϲη τον π αυ και ηκυρωϲα τον νομον λογον νομον του δια την παραδο υμων ·

**English Translation**
He shall by no means honor the father of him; and you voided the law word law of the [One] because of the tradition of yours.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The result of their tradition is the total negation of honor to the father. The text reveals a struggle to define their error, calling the statutes they voided "law word law." By placing their tradition above the divine utterance, they have emptied the Law of its power, rendering the Word of the One inoperative in their lives.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ϋποκριται καλωϲ επροφητευ περι ϋμων η λεγων

**English Translation**
Hypocrites, well prophesied concerning you [Isaiah] saying.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He names them according to their nature: Hypocrites. They wear a mask of piety while dismantling the Law. The prophecy of Isaiah is not a relic of the past but a living indictment of their present condition; the ancient voice speaks directly "concerning you."

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ο λαοϲ ουτοϲ τοιϲ χιλεϲιν με τιμα η δε καρδια αυτ αυτ πορρω απεχει α εμου

**English Translation**
This people with the lips honors me, but the heart of them of them far is distant from me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The worship offered is entirely distinct from the worshiper's reality. The lips perform the office of honor, but the heart is estranged. The doubling of "of them" in the text emphasizes the collective and emphatic possession of their own corruption; their hearts belong to themselves, not to God, and thus they remain far off.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ματην δε ϲεβον με διδαϲκον διδαϲκαλιαϲ ενταλματα α α

**English Translation**
But in vain they worship me, teaching teachings commandments of [men].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Worship becomes futility when the substance of instruction is human invention. The text describes their activity as "teaching teachings" that are merely commandments of men. When the source of doctrine is earthbound, the adoration directed heavenward is empty, achieving nothing.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲα τον οχλον ειπεν αυτοιϲ ακου και ϲυνϊετε

**English Translation**
And having called the crowd he said to them, Hear and understand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Turning from the obstinate teachers, He summons the crowd. The imperative is twofold: one must first "hear" the audible word, but hearing alone suffices not; one must "understand" the spiritual reality. He invites the multitude to perceive what the scribes have obscured.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ου το ειϲερχομενον ειϲ το ϲτομα του κοινοι τον αν αλλα το εκπορευο εκ του ϲτο τουτο κοι τον α

**English Translation**
Not that entering into the mouth [this] defiles the man; but that proceeding out of the mouth, this defiles the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He relocates the seat of purity from the dietary to the moral. Food entering the mouth is external and transient, incapable of touching the soul. True defilement is an outward flow from an inward source; it is the "proceeding out" that manifests the corruption of the man.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲελθοντεϲ οι μαθηται ειπαν αυτω οιδαϲ οτι οι φαριϲαιοι α τον λο εϲκανδαλιϲθη

**English Translation**
Then approaching the disciples said to him, Know you that the Pharisees [hearing] the word were scandalized?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples are anxious, noting the offense taken by the religious authorities. The Pharisees were "scandalized" not by a deed, but by the "word" they heard. The Truth, when spoken plainly, acts as a stumbling block to those who cling to human tradition.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθιϲ ειπ ειπ παϲα φυτια ην ου εφυτευϲεν ο μου ο ουρανιοϲ εκ

**English Translation**
But answering he said said, "Every planting which my the heavenly [one] did not plant [shall be taken] out."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master distinguishes between the works of men and the works of the divine. Only the planting established by the heavenly one possesses the root necessary for endurance; all else, no matter how lush in appearance, is destined for removal, lacking the sustenance of the eternal source.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
αφετε αυτουϲ οδη ειϲιν τυφλοι τυφλοι ειϲιν οδηγοι τυφλων οδηγοι ειϲιν τυφλοι τυφλοϲ δε τυφλον εαν οδηγη αμφο ειϲ βοθυνον πεϲουνται πεϲουντε

**English Translation**
Leave them; guides they are blind; blind are guides of blind; guides are blind; and if blind guides blind, both into a pit will fall will fall.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of blindness sounds a dire warning against following those who lack spiritual sight. When the leader is bereft of vision, the journey does not lead to illumination but to the pit; the ruin is mutual, as neither the guide nor the follower can discern the danger of the descent.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ὁ πετροϲ ειπεν αυτω φραϲον ημιν την παραβολην

**English Translation**
But answering Peter said to him, "Explain to us the parable."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter stands as the voice of the seeking soul, admitting his inability to penetrate the mystery without aid. He asks for the riddle to be dissolved, understanding that the interpretation of truth must come from the same authority that issued the teaching.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ακμην και ϋμιϲ αϲυνετοι εϲτε

**English Translation**
And he said, "Are you also still without understanding?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sharp rebuke falls upon those who have walked closely with the Word yet remain dull in perception. The persistence of ignorance among the intimate disciples reveals the hardness of the human intellect, which struggles to grasp spiritual realities even when the Light is present.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ουπω νοϊτε οτι παν το ειϲπορευ ειϲ το ϲτο ειϲ την κοιλι χωρι και ειϲ τον αφεδρωνα εκβαλ

**English Translation**
Do you not yet perceive that everything entering into the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the latrine?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord delineates the boundary between the physical and the moral. Food is merely matter, traversing a path of decay from the mouth to the belly and finally to the place of waste; it touches only the vessel of the body and holds no power to alter the state of the soul.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
τα δε εκπορευ εκ του ϲτο εκ τηϲ καρ εξερχεται κα κοιν τον αν

**English Translation**
But the things proceeding out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and those defile the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mouth is the gate through which the hidden nature of the heart marches forth. Defilement is not an external imposition but an internal revelation; words act as the evidence of the soul's condition, bringing the corruption capable of staining the man out into the open.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
εκ γαρ τη καρ εξερχονται διαλογιϲμοι πο φονοι · μοι · πορνιαι · κλο · ψευδομαρτυρι · βλαϲφημιαι ·

**English Translation**
For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heart is unveiled as the forge of all iniquity. Before murder or theft is committed by the hand, it is conceived in the desires; the root of sin lies deep within, and these listed vices are but the poisonous fruit of a tree already corrupt at its core.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ταυτα εϲτιν τα κοι τον α το δε ανιπτοιϲ χερ φαγιν ου κοι τον α

**English Translation**
These are the things defiling the man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True purity is defined not by ritual ablutions of the skin but by the integrity of the conscience. The washing of hands is a triviality compared to the cleansing of the interior, for it is the vices of the heart that render a man unclean, not the dust of the market.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθων εκι ο ανεχωρη ειϲ τα μερη τυ και ϲιδωνοϲ

**English Translation**
And going forth thence, he withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He retreats from the disputes of the legalists to the borders of the Gentiles. This withdrawal signals a shift in the dispensation of grace, moving away from those who boast of the law to a region synonymous with distance from the covenant.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου γυνη χα απο των οριων εκινων ε εκραξ εκραζ λεγουϲα ελεηϲον με ϋϊε η θυ μου κακωϲ δαιμονιζετε

**English Translation**
And behold, a Canaanite woman from those borders came out and cried cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Son; the daughter of me is badly demonized."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The woman's plea identifies him as "Son," acknowledging an authority that transcends her alien status. Her cry fuses her own suffering with that of her child; she does not say "help her" but "have mercy on me," showing that the torment of the daughter is the anguish of the mother.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ουκ απεκριθη αυτη λογον και προϲελ οι μαθη αυτου ηρωτο ηρωτο αυτον λεγοντεϲ απολυϲον αυτην οτι κραζει οπιϲθ ημων

**English Translation**
But he did not answer her a word. And approaching, his disciples besought besought him, saying, "Dismiss her, because she cries out behind us."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine silence serves to test the mettle of faith, forcing the supplicant to persist. The disciples, however, see only a nuisance; their request to dismiss her arises from a desire for their own quiet rather than compassion for her plight, revealing a narrowness of charity.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε αποκριθιϲ ει ουκ απεϲτα ει μη ειϲ τα προβατα τα απο οικου

**English Translation**
But answering he said, "I was not sent except to the sheep, the lost [ones] of the house."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He defines the primary scope of his mission to the specific flock of the house. This limitation emphasizes the order of divine operation—gathering the lost who belong to the heritage first—and heightens the tension for the outsider who dares to claim a crumb of this exclusive bread.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
η δε ελθουϲα προ προϲεκυνηϲεν αυτω λε βοηθι μοι

**English Translation**
But she coming worshipped him saying help me

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the posture of the supplicant, for she does not merely speak from a distance but approaches to perform the act of adoration. Her worship precedes her petition, establishing the proper order of the soul before the Lord. The cry for help is stripped of all elaboration, revealing that true prayer consists not in many words but in the direct appeal of necessity to power.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε αποκριθειϲ ει ουκ εϲτιν κα λαβιν τον αρ των τεκν τεκν και βαλιν τοιϲ κυ

**English Translation**
But he answering said it is not good to take the bread of the children children and cast to the dogs

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The distinction is drawn between the rightful inheritors and those outside the covenant, here termed dogs. The repetition of "children" emphasizes the priority of the family of faith who possess the first claim upon the sustenance of the Master. It is not fitting to disrupt the divine economy by taking what is holy and designated for the sons to cast it carelessly to the unclean.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
η δε ειπ ειπ ναι και γαρ τα κυ εϲθιει απο τ τ ψιχιων των πιπτ πιπτ απο τηϲ τρα των κυρι αυτων

**English Translation**
But she said said yes for even the dogs eat from the crumbs falling falling from the table of their lords

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She accepts the lowly title without offense, turning the seeming rebuke into the ground of her hope. By acknowledging she belongs beneath the table, she claims the right to that which the children let fall, the fragments that exceed the children's need. The abundance of the lords is such that even the dropped remnants suffice to feed the ones who wait in humility.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
τοτε α ὁ ειπ αυτη ω γυναι με ϲου η πιϲτιϲ · γενηθητω ϲοι ωϲ θελιϲ και ϊαθη η θυγατηρ αυτηϲ απο τηϲ ωραϲ εκινηϲ :

**English Translation**
Then answering he said to her O woman great your faith; let it be done to you as you will and healed was her daughter from that hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord commends not her argument but the magnitude of her faith, which persisted through silence and apparent refusal. The will of the faithful woman is here permitted to direct the divine power, as he grants that the outcome shall align with her desire. The healing is immediate, demonstrating that the distance of the daughter was no barrier to the authority of the word spoken.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και μεταβαϲ εκιθεν ὁ ηλθ ηλθ παρα την θαλαϲϲ θαλαϲϲ τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ και αναβαϲ ειϲ το οροϲ εκαθητο εκει

**English Translation**
And departing thence he came came beside the sea sea of Galilee and going up into the mountain he sat there

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He moves from the region of the Gentile woman back to the familiar waters, yet he ascends the mountain to take his seat. This posture of sitting upon the height signifies the establishment of his tribunal of mercy and teaching. The elevation of the mountain separates the holy work from the common plain, inviting those who seek him to ascend.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και προϲηλθον αυ οχλοι πολλοι εχοντεϲ μεθ εαυτ εαυτ χωλουϲ · τυφλουϲ · κυλλουϲ · κωφουϲ · και ετερουϲ πολλουϲ και εριψαν αυτουϲ παρα τουϲ ποδαϲ αυ και εθεραπευϲ εθεραπευϲ αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And came to him crowds many having with themselves themselves lame blind maimed deaf and others many and they cast them beside his feet and he healed healed them

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitude brings the wreckage of human frailty—the lame and blind—and casts them down at the feet of the Lord in an act of total surrender. To be cast at his feet is to acknowledge that no other help remains, and this proximity to the divine presence is the precursor to restoration. The twofold mention of healing confirms the completeness of the cure for the varied miseries presented.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ωϲτε τον οχλον θαυμαϲε βλε κωφουϲ λαλουνταϲ και χωλουϲ περιπα : και τυφλουϲ βλεπονταϲ και εδοξαζον τον ι

**English Translation**
So that the crowd marveled seeing deaf speaking and lame walking and blind seeing and they glorified the I

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sensory evidence of the miracles compels the crowd to wonder, as the faculties of speech, walk, and sight are restored to those deprived. The sight of the deaf speaking and the lame walking serves as a tangible testament that overrides unbelief. Their response is to direct glory toward the I—the divine source identified here by the sacred initial—acknowledging the presence of power in their midst.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε προϲκαλεϲα τουϲ μαθη ειπεν αυτοιϲ ϲπλαγχνιζομε ε τον οχλον οτι ηδη ημεραϲ · · προ μοι και ουκ εχουϲιν τι φα και απολυ αυτουϲ νηϲτιϲ ου θελω μη εκλυ εν τη οδω

**English Translation**
But he calling the disciples said to them I have compassion on the crowd because already days . . they stay with me and they have not what they might eat and to release them fasting I do not will lest they faint in the way

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord initiates the care for the multitude, moved by compassion for their endurance in remaining with him for days. He perceives their physical limit, refusing to send them away empty lest the journey home overcome their strength. His providence extends not only to healing their infirmities but to sustaining their bodies against the weakness of hunger.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και λεγουϲιν αυτω οι μαθηται ποθ ποθ ημιν εν ερημια αρτοι τοϲουτοι ωϲ χορταϲε οχλον τοϲουτον

**English Translation**
And say to him the disciples whence whence to us in a desert loaves so many as to satisfy a crowd so great

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples look to the desolation of the wilderness and the magnitude of the need, failing to look to the one who questions them. Their double query "whence whence" betrays a panic that calculates scarcity rather than relying on the presence of the Provider. They see only the desert and the crowd, measuring the impossible gap between the two.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και λεγι αυτοιϲ ο ποϲουϲ αρτουϲ εχετε οι δε ειπαν επτα · και ο ϊχθυδια

**English Translation**
And says to them the how many loaves have you but they said seven and f[ew] little fishes

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He demands an accounting of what they possess, for grace often builds upon the offering of our small substance. They present the number seven, a figure of completion, yet in their eyes it is insufficient for the task. The mention of the little fishes signifies that even the smallest additional provision is noted and utilized in the divine economy.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και παραγγιλαϲ τω οχλω αναπεϲιν ε την γην

**English Translation**
And commanding the crowd to recline on the earth

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Order is imposed upon the chaos of the hungry multitude before the miracle occurs. By commanding them to recline on the earth, he prepares them as guests at a banquet, though the table is but the ground. Obedience to this command is the first step in receiving the bread, requiring the people to settle and wait.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
ελαβ ελαβ τουϲ επτα αρτουϲ κ(αι) τουϲ δυο ϊχθυαϲ και ευχαριϲτηϲαϲ εκλαϲεν και εδι τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ μαθητεϲ οι δε μαθηται μαθητε τοιϲ οχλοιϲ

**English Translation**
He took took the seven loaves and the two fishes and giving thanks he broke and gave to the disciples disciples but the disciples disciples to the crowds

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act of taking and giving thanks sanctifies the creation, transforming the limited seven loaves into an abundance through the blessing. The text emphasizes the mediation of the disciples, who receive from the Lord to distribute to the people, establishing the structure of ministry. The sustenance flows from the head, through the hands of the servants, to the waiting multitude.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και εφαγ παντεϲ και εχορ και η το περιϲϲευ των κλαϲματ επτα ϲπυριδαϲ πλη

**English Translation**
And all ate and were filled, and they took up the surplus of the fragments seven baskets full.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The universality of the divine provision is established in the phrase "all ate"; no member of the company is left destitute, for the sustenance of the Lord is intended for the whole body. Their state changes from hunger to satisfaction, as they "were filled," proving that the spiritual food satisfies completely where earthly bread fails. The abundance of grace is such that the remnants exceed the original supply, resulting in "seven baskets full," a number signifying the perfection and rest found in the gathering of God's gifts.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
οι δε εϲθιοντεϲ ηϲαν ανδρεϲ ωϲι τετρακιϲχιλιοι χωριϲ πεδιων και γυνεκων

**English Translation**
Now those eating were men about four thousand, apart from children and women.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The evangelist records the number "four thousand," marking the multitude with a concrete figure that testifies to the magnitude of the miracle. Yet, the census is deliberately incomplete, noting the presence of "children and women" who exist "apart from" the count; this reveals that the scope of divine mercy always extends beyond the calculated expectations of men. The defining characteristic of this vast assembly is not their speech or their origin, but their action: they are "those eating," united in the reception of the one bread.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και απολυϲαϲ τουϲ οχλουϲ ενεβη ειϲ το πλοιον και ηλθ ειϲ τα ορια μαγαδ μαγεδ

**English Translation**
And having dismissed the crowds, he stepped into the boat and came into the borders of Magad Maged.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord does not abandon the people but "dismissed" them, sending them forth carrying the fullness they had received. He enters "the boat," utilizing the vessel as a means of transit, separating Himself from the multitude to continue His work elsewhere. His arrival in the "borders of Magad Maged" indicates a specific, named destination appointed for the next phase of ministry, anchoring the mystery of His journey in the realities of the earth.
