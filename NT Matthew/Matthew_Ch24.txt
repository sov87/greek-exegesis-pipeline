**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθων ο απο του ϊερου επο και προϲ οι μαθητε αυτου επιδιξε αυ ταϲ οικοδομαϲ του ϊερου

**English Translation**
And having gone out, the [Jesus] [went] from the temple, and his disciples [came] to show him the buildings of the temple.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the deliberate motion of departure. He goes out from the sacred precinct, signaling that the divine presence is severing its bond with the stone sanctuary. The disciples, tethered still to earthly appearances, direct his gaze back to the "buildings of the temple," admiring the construction at the very moment the Architect prepares to decree its desolation. We see here the tension between the spiritual judgment of God and the material fascination of man.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει αυτοιϲ ου βλε ταυτα παντα αμην λεγω ϋμιν ου μη αφεθη ωδε λιθοϲ επι λιθον οϲ ου καταλυθηϲε

**English Translation**
But answering he said to them: Do you not see all these things? Amen I say to you, there shall not be left here stone upon stone which shall not be destroyed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord shatters the illusion of permanence. He asks if they "see all these things," not to admire them, but to witness their fragility. The solemn "Amen" seals the verdict: the dismantling shall be total. No stone shall rest upon another, for the physical structure must be utterly dissolved to make way for a spiritual edifice that cannot be thrown down. It is a terrifying pronouncement against reliance on external forms of religion.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
καθημενου δε αυ επι του ορουϲ τ ελεων προϲηλθ αυτω οι μαθηται καθ ϊδιαν λεγον ειπε ημιν πο ποτε ταυτα εϲτε και τι το ϲημιον τηϲ ϲηϲ παρουϲιαϲ και ϲυν του αιωνοϲ

**English Translation**
And as he was sitting upon the mount of the olives, the disciples came to him in private saying: Tell us, when shall these things be, and what the sign of thy presence and [consummation] of the age?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Seated upon the mount, the Lord assumes the posture of the Judge and Teacher. The inquiry is made "in private," for the mysteries of the end are not for the mocking crowd but for the faithful few. They ask a threefold question: of the timing, the sign of his presence, and the consummation of the age. They rightly link the destruction of the temple with the closing of the aeon, understanding that the fall of the old covenant's house heralds a cosmic shift.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο ειπεν αυτοιϲ βλεπε μη τιϲ ϋμαϲ πλα

**English Translation**
And answering the [Jesus] said to them: See that no one [deceive] you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Before answering of times or seasons, the Lord issues a command of vigilance regarding the mind. The danger is not merely physical destruction, but deception. "See," he commands, placing the burden of discernment upon the disciples. The greatest threat to the church in the last times is not the sword of the persecutor, but the lie of the seducer who seeks to lead the flock astray.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
πολλοι γαρ ελευϲοντε επι τω ονοματι μου λεγοντεϲ εγω ειμι ο και πολλουϲ πλανηϲουϲιν

**English Translation**
For many shall come in my name saying, I am the [Christ], and many they shall deceive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the nature of the deception warned of: the usurpation of the Divine Name. Many will come not as enemies, but assuming the persona of the Savior, declaring "I am." It is a theft of identity intended to mislead the many. We learn that heresy often wears the mask of orthodoxy, and the antichrist spirit mimics the voice of the true Shepherd to entrap the unwary.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
μελληϲετε δε ακου πολεμουϲ κ(αι) ακοαϲ πολεμ ορατε μη θροειϲθε δι γαρ γενεϲθαι αλ ουπω εϲτιν το τε

**English Translation**
And you shall be about to hear wars and reports of wars; see that you be not troubled; for it is necessary to happen, but not yet is the end.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The turbulence of nations is presented as a necessity, not an accident. We are told "it is necessary to happen," binding the chaos of history to the providence of God. Yet, the Lord forbids panic; "be not troubled." These violent upheavals are merely the prelude, not the conclusion. The faithful must endure the noise of battle without losing the peace of the soul, knowing the end is not yet.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
εγερθηϲετε γαρ ε επ εθνοϲ κ(αι) βαϲιλια επι βαϲιλι και εϲοντε ϲιϲμοι και λιμοι κατα τοπουϲ

**English Translation**
For nation shall be raised against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes and famines in places.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Creation itself joins the tumult of humanity. As political structures fracture—nation against nation—the physical earth shudders with earthquakes and famines. This universal discord testifies that the created order is groaning under the weight of sin and approaching its judgment. The instability of the ground we walk upon mirrors the instability of the kingdoms we inhabit; nowhere is safe but in Christ.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
παντα δε ταυτα αρ ωδινων

**English Translation**
But all these things are the beginning of birth-pains.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord reframes suffering as travail. He does not call these calamities "death-pangs" but "birth-pains." This distinction is vital for our hope: the agony of the world is not a slide into oblivion but the labor required for the new creation to be born. The pain is sharp and real, yet it is the herald of life, not the finality of the grave.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
τοτε παραδωϲουϲ ϋμαϲ ειϲ θλιψιν κ(αι) α ϋμαϲ και εϲεϲθε μιϲου ϋπο παντων των ε δια το ονο μου

**English Translation**
Then they shall deliver you into affliction and [kill] you, and you shall be hated by all the [nations] because of my name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hostility shifts from general warfare to specific persecution of the faithful. The reason for this universal hatred—by all nations—is singular: "because of my name." The world cannot abide the presence of the Truth. To bear the Name is to bear the cross. We are promised not safety, but delivery into affliction and death, which is the martyr's victory.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε ϲκανδαλι πολλοι και αλληλουϲ πα ειϲ θλι

**English Translation**
And then many shall be offended and one another [deliver] into [affliction].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A grievous wound opens within the body. It is not only the nations who attack, but "many shall be offended" from within. The text here indicates a betrayal where brethren deliver one another into affliction. The pressure of persecution causes the love of the weak to fracture, turning them into accusers of their own kin. This internal treachery is a darker trial than the external sword.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και πολλοι ψευδο εγερθη και πολλουϲ πλανηϲουϲι

**English Translation**
And many false [prophets] shall be raised and shall deceive many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Alongside the traitors come the liars. False prophets arise to capitalize on the chaos, offering easy answers or smooth words to those desperate for relief. That they "deceive many" stands as a somber warning that the majority may be led astray. Truth is not found in the consensus of the multitude, but in adherence to the unchangeable Word amidst the clamor of falsehood.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και δι το πληθυνθηνε πληθυνθηναι την ανομιαν ψυ η αγαπη τ πολλων

**English Translation**
And because lawlessness is multiplied, the love of the many shall grow cold.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the spiritual climate of the end: a winter of the soul. Lawlessness—the rejection of divine order—does not merely incite violence; it freezes the heart. When iniquity abounds, the distinct mark of the disciple, which is love, is extinguished in the many. To maintain a burning charity in an age of cold lawlessness is the ultimate endurance required of the saints.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ϋπομιναϲ ειϲ τελοϲ ουτοϲ ϲωθη

**English Translation**
But the one having endured to the end, this one will be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Salvation is here defined not merely by the beginning of faith, but by its conclusion. The text places the condition of endurance (`ϋπομιναϲ`) before the promise of safety; the crown is reserved for the one who remains under the burden until the distinct limit (`τελοϲ`) is reached. One does not secure the soul by fleeting enthusiasm, but by a persistence that outlasts the trial.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και κηρυχθη τουτο το ευ τηϲ βα ειϲ ολην τ οικουμενην ειϲ μαρτυριον παϲι τοιϲ εθνεϲιν και τοτε ηξι το τελοϲ

**English Translation**
And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The proclamation of the kingdom is the prerequisite for the consummation of time. The gospel (`ευ`) is not hidden but acts as a public testimony (`μαρτυριον`) across the entire inhabited earth. The end (`τελοϲ`) waits upon the witness to the nations; the divine timeline is inextricably bound to the work of the church in spreading this word.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
οταν ουν δε ϊδητε το βδελυγμα τηϲ ερη το ρηθ δια ι δανιηλ του προφη εϲτοϲ εν τοπω αγιω ο αναγινω νοειτω

**English Translation**
Therefore whenever you see the abomination of desolation, that spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place (let the one reading understand).

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Visual perception (`ϊδητε`) of the profanation marks the urgency of the hour. The abomination takes its stand precisely where it ought not, in a holy place, fulfilling the prophetic word given through Daniel. The parenthetical command requires the reader to use the mind (`νοειτω`); spiritual discernment is necessary to recognize the fulfillment of ancient prophecy in present events.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
το οι εν τη ϊουδεα ϊουδαια φευγετωϲαν επι τα ορη

**English Translation**
[Then] those in Judea must flee to the mountains.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Geography dictates the response to the crisis; presence in Judea requires immediate departure. The command is to flee upward to the mountains, seeking the heights as a refuge from the judgment befalling the land. Safety is found only in separation from the condemned location.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ο επι του δω μη καταβα καταβητω αραι το τα εκ τηϲ οι αυτου

**English Translation**
The one on the housetop must not come down to take the things out of his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The elevation of the housetop signifies a state of readiness that must not be abandoned for earthly possessions. To descend (`καταβητω`) into the house for material goods is to prioritize the perishable over life itself. The urgency of the flight forbids any return to what has been left behind beneath.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και ο τω αγρω μη επιϲτρε οπιϲω αρε αραι το ϊματιον αυτου

**English Translation**
And the one in the field must not turn back to take his cloak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the worker in the open field must sever attachment to his own garment. The instruction prohibits turning backward (`οπιϲω`) for necessary clothing (`ϊματιον`); the preservation of the body's life supersedes the need for covering or property. One must face forward toward escape, abandoning all claims to the past life.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ουαι δε ταιϲ εν γαϲτρι εχουϲεϲ εχουϲαιϲ και ταιϲ θηλαζουϲεϲ θηλαζουϲαιϲ εν ε εκιναιϲ ταιϲ ημερεϲ ημεραιϲ

**English Translation**
But woe to those having in the womb [are pregnant] and to those nursing in those days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Physical burdens become sources of sorrow in the time of flight. The creation of life (pregnancy) and the sustenance of life (nursing) create attachments that hinder swift escape. The "woe" reflects the tragic reality that natural duties and bodily conditions increase the peril during these specific days (`ταιϲ ημεραιϲ`).

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
προϲευχεϲθε δε μη γενηται η φυ ϋμων χιμω μηδε ϲαββα

**English Translation**
But pray that your flight may not happen in winter nor on a Sabbath.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Prayer is the appointed means to mitigate the harshness of circumstances. We petition against the physical severity of winter (`χειμωνοϲ`), which impedes movement, and the legal restriction of the Sabbath (`ϲαββατω`), which limits travel. The faithful must ask that the timing of the necessary flight aligns with the possibility of survival.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
εϲτε γαρ τοτε θλιψιϲ μεγαλη οια ουκ εγε απ αρχηϲ κο εωϲ του ν ουδʼ ου μη γενητε

**English Translation**
For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will happen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The coming distress is categorized by its magnitude (`μεγαλη`) and its singularity. It stands unique in the entire history of the cosmos, from the beginning (`αρχηϲ`) to the present (`νυν`), and will never be repeated. This text delineates a suffering that surpasses all prior and future experience of the created order.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ει μη εκολοβω αι ημεραι ε ουκ αν εϲω παϲα ϲαρξ δια δε τουϲ εκλεκτουϲ εκο κολοβωθηϲονται αι η εκιναι

**English Translation**
And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but because of the elect those days will be shortened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The preservation of humanity ("all flesh") depends entirely on the divine limitation of the time of trial. The days are shortened (`εκολοβωθηϲονται`) not for the sake of the world, but specifically on account of the elect (`τουϲ εκλεκτουϲ`). God intervenes in the duration of the calamity to ensure a remnant survives.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
τοτε εαν τιϲ ϋμιν ειπη ϊδου ωδε ο η ωδε μη πιϲτευϲη

**English Translation**
Then if anyone says to you, "Behold, here [is] the [One]," or "here," do not believe [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The danger of the time includes false localization of the savior. When men point to a specific place (`ωδε`), claiming the presence of the deliverer, the command is explicitly negative: do not believe (`μη πιϲτευϲη`). Faith must not be seduced by reports of a physical presence that contradicts the true manner of His coming.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
εγερθηϲονται γαρ ι ψευδοχριϲτοι και ψευδοπροφη και δωϲουϲιν ϲημια και τερατα ωϲτε πλανηθη ει δυνατον και τουϲ εκλεκτουϲ

**English Translation**
For false Christs and false prophets will be raised up and will give signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Deception arises through power; false Christs and prophets demonstrate actual signs (`ϲημια`) and wonders. These displays are designed with the specific intent to mislead (`πλανηθη`), targeting the very chosen ones (`τουϲ εκλεκτουϲ`). The existence of miracles is not proof of truth; the faithful must discern the source, for the attempt is made to shake the very foundation of the elect.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ϊ προειρηκα ϋμ

**English Translation**
Behold, I have foretold to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord employs the imperative "Behold" to command attention to the prophecy. By stating that He has spoken beforehand, He strips the faithful of any excuse for surprise or terror when the events unfold. The foretelling itself is a shield; to know the tribulation is coming is the first step in enduring it without the collapse of faith.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
εαν ουν ειπωϲιν ϊδου εν τη ερημω εϲτιν μη εξελθη ϊδου εν τοιϲ ταμι μη πιϲτευϲη

**English Translation**
If therefore they say, Behold in the desert he is, go not out; Behold in the inner rooms, believe not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The deception warns of two false locations: the "desert," a place of public barrenness, and the "inner rooms," a place of private secrecy. The command is twofold: physical restraint ("go not out") and intellectual steadfastness ("believe not"). The Truth is not confined to the wilderness nor hidden in secret chambers; the faithful must reject any claim that restricts the presence of the Lord to a concealed locality.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ωϲπερ γαρ η αϲτρα εξερχετε απο ανατολων και φαινετε εωϲ δυϲμ ουτωϲ εϲτε η πα του του

**English Translation**
For just as the lightning comes out from east and appears unto west, so shall be the presence of the... of the...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text offers a comparison to "the lightning," which requires no herald to announce it, for it illuminates the entire horizon from east to west in an instant. The fractured reading "of the... of the..." points to the ineffable nature of the One whose "presence" is described. This presence will be sudden, undeniable, and universally visible, shattering the need for the secret rumors mentioned previously.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
που οπου οπου εαν ῆ το ϲωμα πτωμα εκι ϲυναχθηϲον οι αετοι

**English Translation**
Where where where if be the body corpse, there shall be gathered the eagles.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The triple repetition "Where where where" emphasizes the inevitability of the location. The gathering is not around a phantom, but around the "body corpse"—a visceral reality that draws the "eagles" with unerring instinct. This signifies the gathering of the saints to the slain yet victorious Lord, for where the sacrifice is found, there the faithful congregate.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ευθεωϲ δε μετα τ θλιψιν των ημερ εκινων ο ηλιοϲ ϲκοτιϲθηϲετε και η ϲεληνη ου δωϲι το φεγγοϲ αυτηϲ κ(αι) οι αϲτερεϲ πεϲο εκ του και αι δυναμιϲ τ ο ϲαλευθη

**English Translation**
And immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall out of the... and the powers of the... shall be shaken.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cosmic lights—sun, moon, and stars—fail because a greater Light approaches. The stars fall "out of the..." and the powers are shaken, indicating the dismantling of the old creation's stability. The "darkness" of the sun is not merely an eclipse but a bowing down of the created order before the judgment of its Creator.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε φα το ϲημι του του εν ουρανω και τοτε κοψ παϲε ε παϲαι αι φυλαι τηϲ γηϲ και οψοντε τ του ανου ερχο επι των νε του μετα δυναμεωϲ κ(αι) δοξηϲ πολληϲ

**English Translation**
And then shall appear the sign of the... of the... in heaven, and then shall mourn all... all the tribes of the earth and they shall see the... of the man coming upon the clouds of the... with power and much glory.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "sign" appears in heaven, distinct from the darkening lights. The text speaks of "the... of the man" coming upon the clouds, emphasizing His humanity ("man") amidst the celestial display. The mourning of "all... all" the tribes suggests a universal recognition of their error or their judgment, as the sight of His "power and much glory" replaces the familiar lights of the sky.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και αποϲτελι τουϲ αγγελουϲ αυτου με ϲαλπιγγοϲ μεγα και επιϲυναξι επιϲυναξουϲ τουϲ εκλεκτουϲ αυ εκ των · · ανεμ απ ακρων ουραν εωϲ ακρων αυτ

**English Translation**
And he shall send his angels with a great trumpet, and he shall gather gather his elect out of the... winds from ends of heavens unto ends of them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double command to "gather gather" ensures the completeness of the assembly; not one of the elect shall be lost. The scope is total, ranging from the winds to the very "ends of heavens." The "great trumpet" signals the final liturgy of the age, calling the scattered faithful into one body from the extremities of the cosmos.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
απο δε τηϲ ϲυκηϲ μα την παραβολ οταν ηδη ο κλαδοϲ αυτηϲ γενητε απα και τα φυλλα εκ γινωϲκετε ο εγγυϲ το θεροϲ

**English Translation**
Now from the fig tree learn the parable: when already its branch becomes tender and the leaves... know that near is the summer.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nature serves as a divine pedagogue. The "tender" branch signifies life returning after the winter of tribulation. Just as the physical signs on a tree inevitably predict the "summer"—the season of harvest and heat—so too must the faithful discern the approach of the end through the signs given.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ και ϋμιϲ ο ϊδητε ταυτα παντα γινωϲκετε οτι εγγυϲ εϲτιν επι θυραιϲ

**English Translation**
So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near at the doors.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The recognition must be immediate upon seeing "all these things." The proximity is described as being "at the doors," implying that the Judge stands at the very threshold of the world and of the soul. There is no distance left to traverse; only the opening of the door remains.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν ου μη παρελθη η γενεα αυτη εωϲ παντα ταυτα γενη

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, this generation shall not pass away until all these things happen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord binds the certainty of the events to "this generation," a term identifying the faithful race or the specific era of the last days. The "Amen" seals the prophecy as irrevocable. The endurance of the generation is guaranteed only until the fulfillment of "all these things," marking the completion of the divine economy.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ο και η γη παρελευϲεται οι δε λογοι μου ου μη παρελθωϲιν

**English Translation**
The and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads "The and the earth," implicitly encompassing the heavens by the article alone. The physical creation—both the solid earth and the implied heavens—is transient and destined to pass. In contrast, the "words" of Christ possess an eternal substance that outlasts the material universe, providing the only stable foundation for the believer.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
περι δε τηϲ ημε> εκεινηϲ και > ωραϲ ουδειϲ οιδ οιδ ουδε οι αγγελοι τ ουρανων ουδε > ο υιοϲ ουδε ο υιοϲ ει μη ο πα μονοϲ

**English Translation**
But concerning that day and hour no one knows knows, neither the angels of the heavens, nor the Son nor the Son, except the Father alone.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The profound mystery of the final hour is guarded by a double negation and repetition. "No one knows knows" emphasizes the absolute lack of knowledge in creation. The repetition "nor the Son nor the Son" starkly underlines the economic submission of the Son in this matter. The knowledge belongs to the "Father alone," silencing all human calculation and angelical inquiry.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
ωϲπερ δε αι ημεραι του > νωε ουτωϲ εϲται η παρουϲια του του

**English Translation**
But just as the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the [Son].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the strict parallel the Lord establishes. He does not compare the coming simply to a flood, but to "the days of Noah." It is a span of time characterized by a specific disposition of the world. As the days were then—full of warning yet devoid of heed—so is the presence of the [Son]. The repetition of the article in the text serves to emphasize the singular and divine nature of this coming; it is not merely an event, but the arrival of the One who defines the age.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
ωϲ γαρ η εν ταιϲ ημε ταιϲ προ του κατακλυϲμου τρω και πειν κ(αι) γαμουντεϲ κ(αι) γαμιζοντεϲ αχρι ηϲ ημεραϲ ειϲηλ> νωε ειϲ την κιβωτον

**English Translation**
For as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage, until which day Noah entered into the ark.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text enumerates the mundane necessities of the flesh—eating, drinking, marriage. Note that these acts are not in themselves sinful, yet they become the instruments of destruction when they obscure the judgment of God. The people were consumed by the preservation of life and lineage exactly at the moment when life was to be extinguished. The entry of Noah into the ark marks the precise boundary between the time of mercy and the time of the flood.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ ε ο εωϲ ηλθεν ο κατακλυ και ηρεν α> ουτωϲ ε και η παρου του υϊου του > ανθρωπου

**English Translation**
And they did not know until the flood came and took [them]; so will be also the coming of the Son of Man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ignorance here is not an excuse but a condemnation. It says "they did not know," implying a willful blindness, for the ark was being built before their eyes. The flood "took" them; the Greek suggests a violent sweeping away. Thus, the Parousia of the Son of Man will not meet a world prepared in wisdom, but a world preoccupied and consequently taken by surprise.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
τοτε εϲονται δυο δυο εϲονται τω αγρω ειϲ παραλαμ και ειϲ αφι

**English Translation**
Then there will be two, two will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text repeats the number: "two, two." This duality emphasizes the external similarity of the men. Both stand in the same field, engaged in the same labor, under the same sun. Yet, the divine election severs this unity instantly. One is received near—taken to the Lord—while the other is abandoned to the judgment of the field. The distinction lies not in the location of the body, but in the state of the soul.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
δυο αληθου> εν τω μυλω μια παραλαμβανεται και μια αφιεται

**English Translation**
Two [women] grinding in the mill; one is taken and one is left.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord moves from the field to the mill, from the open work of men to the domestic toil of women, signifying that no station is exempt from this final separation. The act of grinding serves the daily bread, yet at this moment, the eternal bread alone matters. "One is taken and one is left" demonstrates that intimacy in labor does not guarantee unity in salvation; each soul stands solitary before its Judge.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
γρηγορειτε ουν ο ουκ οιδατε ποια ημερα ο υμων ερχεται

**English Translation**
Watch therefore, because you do not know on what day your [Lord] comes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is absolute: "Watch." The reason given is the deficiency of human knowledge regarding the "day." The text says "your [Lord] comes," emphasizing the personal relation. He is yours by right of creation and redemption, yet His arrival remains sovereign and hidden. Vigilance is the only appropriate posture for the servant who acknowledges his master's freedom to arrive unannounced.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
εκεινο δε γινωϲκε οτι ει ηδει ο οικο ποια φυ ο κλεπτηϲ ερ εγρηγορηϲ αν και ουκ αν ειαϲ διορυχθηναι την οικιαν αυτου

**English Translation**
But know that, that if the householder knew in what watch the thief comes, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be dug through.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord compares His coming to that of a thief, not in malice, but in unpredictability and stealth. The "householder" represents the mind guarding the soul. If the specific "watch" (division of the night) were known, the vigilance would be temporary and calculated. Since it is unknown, the vigilance must be perpetual. To allow the house to be "dug through" is to suffer the breach of the soul's defenses by the suddenness of judgment.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
δια > τουτο και ϋμειϲ γινεϲθε ετοιμοι οτι η ου δοκειτε ωρα ο ϋϊοϲ του αν ερχεται

**English Translation**
Because of this, you also become ready, for in an hour you do not think, the Son of Man comes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Readiness is here commanded as a state of being: "become ready." The danger lies in human opinion—"in an hour you do not think." The intellect creates false securities, assuming it knows the time or the delay. The Son of Man comes precisely through the gap in our expectations, shattering the illusion of our control over time.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
τιϲ αρα εϲτιν ο πιϲτοϲ δουλοϲ και φρονι ον καταϲτη> ο επι τηϲ οι> αυτου του δου αυτοιϲ την τρο εν καιρω

**English Translation**
Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the [Lord] appointed over his household, to give them the food in season?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord asks "Who?" to provoke the conscience of every hearer. The virtues are twofold: "faithful" in heart and "wise" in action. The authority granted is "over his household," but the purpose is service: "to give the food." The "season" is crucial; spiritual nourishment must be dispensed at the proper time. Authority in the church is defined strictly by the distribution of the Master's sustenance to His domestics.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοϲ ο δουλοϲ εκεινοϲ ον ελθ ο αυτου ευρη> ουτωϲ ποιο ·

**English Translation**
Blessed is that servant, whom his [Lord], coming, will find so doing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Blessedness is located in the intersection of the Master's arrival and the servant's action. It says "so doing"—that is, in the very act of dispensing the food. There is no gap allowed between the duty and the coming. He does not say "whom he finds resting" or "whom he finds waiting," but "whom he finds doing." Grace meets the soul in the motion of obedience.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμ οτι επι παϲιν τοιϲ ϋπαρχουϲιν αυτου καταϲτηϲει αυτ

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, that over all his possessions he will appoint him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reward for faithful service over a few things (the household food) is dominion over "all his possessions." The Lord reveals that the stewardship of the present age is a test for the immense authority of the age to come. The faithful servant is elevated from a dispenser of food to a ruler of the Master's total substance.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε ειπη ο κακοϲ δουλοϲ εκινοϲ εν τη καρ> εαυτου χρονι μου ο

**English Translation**
But if that evil servant says in his heart: My [Lord] delays;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark where the evil resides: not initially in the hand, but "in the heart." The corruption begins with an internal dialogue. He calls the Master "My [Lord]," acknowledging the relationship, yet he presumes upon the Master's absence. The thought "delays" is the seed of all subsequent wickedness. He mistakes patience for absence, and in that error, he transforms his stewardship into tyranny.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
και αρ τυπτειν τουϲ ϲυνδουλουϲ εαυ> εϲθιη δε και πι μετα των με

**English Translation**
and [begins] to beat the fellow-servants of him[self], and eats and drinks with the [drunkards]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The delay of the superior reveals the corruption of the heart. By turning his hand against the fellow-servants, this man usurps an authority that was never granted to him, transforming stewardship into tyranny. He abandons the sober duty of waiting and instead joins himself to the [drunkards], seeking communion in excess rather than in service. The violence against his own kind and the indulgence of the flesh are the twin fruits of his belief that no judgment approaches.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
ηξει ο του δουλου εκει εν ημερα η ου προϲδοκα και εν ω η ου γινωϲκει

**English Translation**
will come the [master] of that servant in a day which he does not expect and in an [hour] which he does not know

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Certainty of arrival stands against the uncertainty of the time. The [master] returns specifically for that servant, bringing a personal reckoning that cannot be evaded. The servant's ruin lies in his lack of expectation; he fails to perceive the day and remains ignorant of the hour because he ceased to watch. The suddenness of this visitation converts his ignorance into his condemnation.

**Verse 51**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) διχοτομηϲει αυ και το μεροϲ αυ μετα των ϋπο θηϲει εκει εϲται ο κλαυθμοϲ και ο βρυγμοϲ των οδοντων

**English Translation**
and will cut him in two and his part with the [hypocrites] will place; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The punishment mirrors the duplicity of his life; as he was divided in his loyalty, so he is cut in two in his judgment. His portion is assigned with the [hypocrites] because he wore the guise of a servant while living as a lord of misrule. He is cast out from the household he abused, and in that place of exclusion, the weeping and the gnashing of teeth manifest the physical reality of his eternal regret and torment.
