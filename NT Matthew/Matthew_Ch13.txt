**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
εν τη ημερα εκινη εξελθων ο εκ τηϲ οικιαϲ εκαθητο παρα τ θαλαϲϲαν

**English Translation**
On that day, having gone out of the house, he sat by the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The movement from the house to the sea signifies the transition from the private dwelling of the few to the vast gathering of the many. He sits, assuming the posture of authority and judgment, establishing the shore as a boundary between the stability of the land and the turbulence of the waters. The specific day marks a decisive moment where the teaching departs from the enclosure to confront the world.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυ προϲ αυτον οχλοι πολ ωϲτε αυτον ειϲ πλοιον εμβ καθηϲθε και παϲ ο οχλοϲ επι τον αιγιαλον ϊϲτη

**English Translation**
And gathered to him were many crowds, so that he entered into a boat to sit, and all the crowd stood on the shore.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The separation of the teacher in the boat from the crowd on the shore establishes a necessary distance for instruction, distinguishing the divine source from the earthly recipient. The boat becomes the pulpit of the Church floating upon the waters of the world. The standing posture of the crowd indicates their reverence and readiness to receive the doctrine delivered from the waves.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και ελαληϲεν αυ πολλα εν πα λεγων ϊδου εξηλθεν ο ϲπι του ϲπιρε

**English Translation**
And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying: Behold, the sower went out to sow.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sower going out represents the Incarnation, where the Word leaves the bosom of the Father to plant truth in human soil. The use of parables veils the mystery, protecting the holy pearls from being trampled while inviting the seeker to investigate the hidden meaning. The act of sowing defines the divine economy as one of broad and generous distribution of grace.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και εν τω ϲπιριν αυ α μεν επεϲ παρα την οδον και ηλθεν τα πετινα και κατεφαγεν αυτα

**English Translation**
And in his sowing, some fell by the way, and the birds came and devoured them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The seed falling by the way denotes the word given to a heart hardened by the traffic of worldly concerns. It lies exposed on the surface, unable to penetrate the trodden path of the mind. The birds act as swift agents of theft, removing the offer of salvation immediately before it can take root or bear understanding.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
αλλα δε επεϲεν ε τα πετρωδη ο ουκ ειχεν γ πολλην και ευθε εξανετιλεν δι το μη εχιν βαθοϲ γηϲ

**English Translation**
And others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much earth; and immediately they sprang up because they had no depth of earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Rapid growth signifies a superficial reception of the truth, where emotional zeal masks the hardness of the underlying nature. The rocky places allow no room for the roots to descend, forcing the life of the plant upward prematurely. True virtue requires the depth of soil which permits slow and substantial maturation.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ηλιου δε ανα εκαυμα και δια το μη εχειν ριζαν ε

**English Translation**
But the sun having risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rising sun serves as the necessary test of tribulation which distinguishes true life from temporary appearance. That which lacks a root cannot draw moisture from the depths and must perish under the intensity of the heat. Withering is the inevitable end of faith that exists only in the external appearance and not in the internal reality.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
αλλα δε επεϲεν ε ταϲ ακανθαϲ και ανεβηϲαν αι ακανθαι και επνι αυτα

**English Translation**
And others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The thorns represent the anxieties and pleasures that grow alongside the good seed in a divided heart. They do not prevent the initial sprouting but violently compete for the sustenance of the soul. The ascent of the thorns demonstrates the aggressive nature of vice, which seeks to strangle the divine life before it can produce fruit.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
αλλα δε επεϲεν ε την γην την κα και εδιδου καρπον ο μεν ε ο δε εξηκ ο δε

**English Translation**
And others fell on the good earth and gave fruit: some a hundred, some sixty, some...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The good earth accepts the seed, cherishes it, and transforms it into a harvest, signifying the receptive and obedient heart. The variation in yield reveals that even among the faithful, there are degrees of capacity and labor. The text lists the measures of fruitfulness, acknowledging that grace works distinctly in each vessel according to its preparation.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ο εχων ωτα ακουε ακουετω

**English Translation**
He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This command distinguishes between the physical organ of hearing and the spiritual faculty of understanding. To have ears to hear implies an inner attunement to the divine voice that transcends mere auditory perception. It acts as a seal upon the parable, summoning only those with spiritual intent to penetrate the veil of the imagery.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθοντεϲ οι μαθηται ειπ αυτω δια τι εν πα αυτοιϲ λαλειϲ λαλειϲ αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And coming to him, the disciples said to him: Why in parables do you speak to them? You speak to them?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples approach to inquire about the method of instruction, recognizing the barrier erected by the parabolic form. Their question highlights the distinction between the intimate teaching given to the followers and the obscure speech offered to the multitude. The repetition in their speech underscores their perplexity at this mode of address.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ειπεν οτι ϋμιν δεδοται γνωνε τα μυϲτηρια τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ των ου εκινοιϲ δε ου δεδοται

**English Translation**
And answering, he said: Because to you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those it has not been given.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Knowledge of the divine mysteries is a gift of grace, not a right of nature. The separation is stark between "you" who have received the gift and "those" who remain outside the understanding. The kingdom of the heavens contains secrets that are locked against the proud but opened by divine concession to the humble disciples.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
οϲτιϲ γαρ εχει δο αυτω και περιϲϲευθηϲετε οϲτιϲ δε ουκ εχι και ο εχει αρθηϲε απ αυτου

**English Translation**
For whoever has, to him it shall be given, and he shall be made to abound; but whoever has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Spiritual possession attracts greater abundance; the one who holds the truth firmly receives an increase of wisdom. Conversely, the one who lacks the substance of faith loses even the superficial appearance of good he thought he possessed. This divine law dictates that negligence leads to total destitution, while diligence secures an overflowing measure.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
δια του εν παραβολεϲ παραβολαιϲ αυτοιϲ λαλω οτι βλεποντεϲ ου βλεπουϲιν και α ουκ α ουδε ϲυνϊουϲιν

**English Translation**
On account of this in parables I speak to them, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The choice to speak in parables is an act of judgment upon the disposition of the listener. Truth is veiled not to hide it from the seeking eye, but because the people possess faculties of sight and hearing that refuse to function according to their created purpose. They see the physical form but reject the spiritual reality.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και αναπληρου αυτοιϲ η προ ηϲαϊου η λεγουϲα ακοη ακουϲετε και ου μη ϲυνητε και βλεποντεϲ βλε και ου μη ϊ

**English Translation**
And is fulfilled to them the prophecy of Esaias which says: By hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and shall not see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ancient word of Esaias finds its completion in this present obstinacy. The prophecy warns that mere sensory experience—hearing the sound or seeing the event—guarantees no true perception; rather, the very act of hearing without understanding confirms their spiritual deadness.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
επαχυνθη γαρ η καρδια του λαου τουτου και τοιϲ ωϲιν αυτ βαρεωϲ ηκουϲ και τουϲ οφθαλ αυτων εκαμ μηποτε ϊδωϲιν τοιϲ ο και τοιϲ ωϲιν αυτων ακουϲωϲ και τη καρδια ϲυνω και επιϲτρε και ϊαϲομε αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
For the heart of this people was fattened, and with their ears heavily they heard, and their eyes they closed; lest they should see with the eyes, and with their ears should hear, and with the heart understand, and return, and I should heal them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The corruption begins internally with the fattened heart, weighing down the senses until the eyes are voluntarily closed against the light. Their resistance is a defense against healing; they fear the cure because it requires a return to the one who heals, preferring their sickness to his restoration.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ϋμων δε μακαρι οι οφθαλμοι ο βλεπουϲιν και τα ωτα ϋμων ο ακουουϲιν

**English Translation**
But blessed are your eyes because they see; and your ears because they hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Blessedness is not found in the mere possession of eyes or ears, but in their proper operation in receiving the mystery. While the people close their eyes, the disciples are declared blessed precisely because their senses are open to the revelation standing before them.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι πολλοι προ και δικεοι δικαιοι επεθυμηϲαν ϊδ α βλεπετε και ου ϊδαν και ακουϲε α ακουετε και ου ηκουϲαν

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, that many prophets and righteous [ones] desired to see what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The longing of the ancient prophets and righteous ones testifies to the unique glory of the present moment. Those holy figures possessed desire, yet were denied the vision that is now granted freely to the disciples, marking this time as the culmination of history's expectation.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ϋμιϲ ουν ακουϲα την παραβο του ϲπιραν ϲπιροντοϲ

**English Translation**
Ye therefore hear the parable of the sowing sower.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to hear distinguishes the disciples from the multitude who hear without understanding. They are invited to inspect the nature of the sowing sower, whose identity and action form the foundation of the teaching.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
παντοϲ ακου τον λογον τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ και μη ϲυ ερχετε ο πονηροϲ και αρ το εϲπαρμε εν τη καρδι αυτου ουτοϲ ε ο παρα την ο ϲπαριϲ

**English Translation**
Everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding, the wicked [one] comes and snatches that sown in his heart; this is the one sown by the way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
When the intellect fails to grasp the word of the kingdom, the heart remains an open road for the wicked one. The seed is not lost due to its own defect, but is snatched away because the hearer provided no safe repository for the sacred deposit.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ο δε επι τα πετρω ϲπαριϲ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο τον λογ ακουων και ευ μετα χαραϲ λαμ αυτον

**English Translation**
But the one sown upon the rocky places, this is the one hearing the word and immediately with joy receiving it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Immediate joy is not always a mark of deep faith; here it signals superficiality. The rocky heart offers no resistance to the entry of the word, but also no depth for its sustenance, accepting the message swiftly only because it does not count the cost.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ου εχι δε ριζαν εν ε αλλα προϲ εϲτιν γε δε θλι η διωγμου δια τον λογον ευ ϲκανδαλιζε

**English Translation**
Yet he has not root in himself, but is temporary; and having happened tribulation or persecution because of the word, immediately he is offended.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The absence of an internal root makes the believer temporal, existing only for the season of ease. Tribulation serves as the necessary winnowing wind; he who lacks root is offended by the very suffering that should have deepened his reliance on the word.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειϲ ταϲ ακαν ϲπαρειϲ ου εϲτιν ο τον λο ακουων και η μεριμνα του αι τουτου και η απα του πλουτου ϲυνπνιγει τον λο και ακαρποϲ γινετε

**English Translation**
And the one sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, and the care of this age and the deceit of riches chokes the word, and he becomes unfruitful.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word is suffocated not by open opposition, but by the crowding of the heart with competing loves—the care of the age and the lie of wealth. These thorns draw the vitality away from the seed, rendering the life barren despite the initial hearing.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ο δε επι την καλ καλ γην ϲπαριϲ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο τον λογ ακουων και ϲυνι οϲ δη καρπο και ποιει ο μεν ο δε ο δε

**English Translation**
But the one sown upon the good good earth, this is the one hearing the word and understanding; who indeed bears fruit and produces, the one indeed [this], the one [that], the other [that].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "good" emphasizes the singular quality of the soil that both hears and understands. The resulting fruitfulness is diverse, as indicated by the threefold distinction, yet all who are of the good earth produce according to their capacity and the grace given.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
αλλην παραβολ παρεθηκεν αυτοιϲ λεγων ωμοιω η βαϲιλια τ ουρανων ϲπιραντι καλον ϲπερμα εν τω α αυτου

**English Translation**
Another parable he set before them, saying: The kingdom of the heavens was likened to [a man] sowing good seed in his field.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The kingdom is portrayed as an active work of sowing good seed within a field that belongs to the sower. This asserts the owner's right over the world and his intentionality in planting that which is good, establishing the dominion of heaven upon the earth.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
εν δε τω καθευδιν τουϲ αν ηλθεν αυτου ο εχθροϲ κ(αι) επεϲπαρκεν επεϲπειρεν επεϲπειρεν ζι ανα μεϲον του ϲιτου και απηλ ˙

**English Translation**
But in the sleeping of the men, his enemy came and sowed sowed sowed tares in the midst of the wheat and went away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe how the negligence of sleep opens the door to malice; while the men rest, the adversary is active. The text repeats the action of sowing three times, emphasizing the relentless and deliberate nature of this corruption. The enemy does not merely scatter seed but sows it deeply and repeatedly within the very midst of the wheat, ensuring the tares are inextricably bound to the good grain, then departs to let the damage grow unseen.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
οτε δε εβλαϲτηϲεν ο χορτοϲ και καρ εποιηϲεν τοτε εφανη και τα ζιζανια

**English Translation**
But when the grass sprouted and made fruit, then appeared also the tares.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The true nature of the seed is hidden in the earth and remains indistinguishable in the early blade; it is only the production of fruit that reveals the presence of the tares. Corruption often mimics virtue until the moment of maturity demands a yield. We see that the evil is not identified by its stalk, but by its failure to produce the good fruit of the wheat, manifesting alongside it.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
προϲελ δε οι δου του οικοδεϲπο ειπον αυτω ουχι καλον ϲπερ εϲπιραϲ εν τω ϲω αγρω ποθεν ουν εχι τα ζιζανι

**English Translation**
And coming, the servants of the house-master said to him, Did you not sow good seed in your field? From where then does it have the tares?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servants rightfully attribute only goodness to the master, knowing that his hand sows only what is noble. Their question reflects the theological confusion of the finite mind witnessing evil in a creation designed by a good authority. They understand the field belongs to him and the seed was his choice, yet they are perplexed by the intrusion of a foreign element that the master did not plant.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εφη αυτοιϲ ε α του εποιηϲεν οι δε δουλοι λεγου αυτω θελιϲ ουν απελθοντεϲ ϲυλλεξωμεν αυ αυτα τα

**English Translation**
And he said to them, An enemy man did this. And the servants say to him, Do you wish then that going away we might gather them?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The master immediately identifies the source of the corruption not as a natural failure of the soil, but as the specific act of an enemy man. The servants, zealous for the purity of the field, propose an immediate separation. They desire to purge the evil instantly, trusting in their own ability to distinguish and gather the tares without delay, yet they submit their will to his wish.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ο δε φηϲιν ου · μηποτε ϲυλλεγ τα ζιζανια εκ αμα αυ τον ϲιτον

**English Translation**
But he says, No; lest gathering the tares you uproot together with them the wheat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the wisdom of restraint; the master forbids the premature judgment because the roots of the wicked and the righteous are currently intertwined in the one soil. To tear out the visible evil now would be to destroy the fragile wheat which has not yet come to harvest. The preservation of the wheat is of such value that the tares are endured for a season.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
α ϲυναυξανε αμφοτερα α μεχρι αχρι του θεριϲμου και εν τω τω καιρω του θεριϲμου ερω τοιϲ θεριϲτεϲ ϲυλ πρωτον τα ζιζανια και δη αυτα ειϲ δεϲ προϲ το κατα αυτα τον δε ϲιτον ϲυναγαγε ειϲ την απο μου

**English Translation**
Let both grow together until until the harvest; and in the the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them, but the wheat gather into my barn.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command allows a temporary coexistence, allowing both to reach their full limit "until until" the appointed end. The harvest serves as the definitive point of separation where confusion is impossible. The priority in judgment is the binding of the tares for destruction, ensuring the field is cleansed before the wheat is secured in the master's barn. The repetition in the text emphasizes the certainty of that specific time.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
αλλην παραβολ παρεθηκεν αυ λεγων ομοι εϲτιν η βαϲιλια των ουρανων κοκ ϲιναπεωϲ λαβων α εϲ εν τω αγρω αυτου

**English Translation**
Another parable he set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard, taking [which] a man sowed in his field;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The kingdom is compared not to a vast forest but to a singular, modest grain of mustard. The man takes this specific small seed and commits it to his own field, indicating an intentional planting of something seemingly insignificant. The power of the kingdom lies not in its initial appearance of grandeur but in the vitality contained within the small grain placed in the earth.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
ο μικροτε μεν εϲτιν παντων των ϲ ϲπερματων ϲπερματων οτ δε αυξηθη αυξηϲη αυξηθη μειζ των λαχανων εϲτιν και γινετε δενδρον ωϲτε ελθειν τα πετι του ο και καταϲκηνουν τοιϲ κλαδοιϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
Which indeed is smaller than all the seeds seeds; but when it has grown grown grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and dwell in its branches.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text emphasizes the extremity of the growth through repetition, stating it is smaller than "seeds seeds" yet when "grown grown grown" it surpasses its nature as a herb to become a tree. This transformation from the least to the greatest structure allows for the birds of heaven to find rest. The kingdom begins in humility but expands to provide shelter for those who fly to it.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
αλλην παραβολ ελαληϲεν αυτοιϲ λεγων ομοια εϲτ εϲτ η βαϲιλεια των ο ζυμη λαβουϲα γυνη ενε ειϲ αλευ ϲατα τρια εωϲ ου εζυμωθη ολον

**English Translation**
Another parable he spoke to them, saying, The kingdom of the [heavens] is like leaven, having taken [which] a woman hid into meal measures three, until the whole was leavened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The operation of the kingdom is internal and pervasive, like leaven hidden within the meal. The woman hides it in "three measures," a complete quantity, and the influence spreads until "the whole" is transformed. The kingdom is not merely an external addition but a force that penetrates and changes the substance of the world from within, working secretly until the total mass is affected.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
ταυτα παντα ελα ο εν πα τοιϲ ο και χωριϲ πα ουδεν ε ουκ ελαλι αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and without a parable he spoke nothing to them;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To the crowds, the mysteries are clothed entirely in parables; he does not speak bare truths to the multitudes but veils wisdom in imagery. The text emphasizes the exclusivity of this method for the public ear, noting that he spoke "nothing" to them without this covering. The parable serves as both a vehicle for truth and a partition for those not ready to perceive the naked reality.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
οπωϲ πληρωθη το ρηθεν δια ηϲα του προφητου λεγοντοϲ ανοι εν παραβολεϲ το ϲτομα μου ερευ κεκρυμ απο κατα κοϲμου κοϲμου

**English Translation**
That might be fulfilled that spoken through Esaias the prophet saying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The evangelist explicitly identifies the prophet Esaias as the voice foretelling this teaching method. The utterance of "things hidden" from the very foundation of the "world world" indicates that these truths have existed since creation but remained concealed until this moment. The opening of the mouth in parables is the fulfillment of ancient prophecy, revealing the deep architecture of God's plan which was previously kept secret.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
τοτε αφιϲ τουϲ ο ειϲηλθεν ειϲ την οικιαν και προϲηλθον προϲηλθεν αυτω οι μαθητε αυτου λεγοντεϲ διαϲαφηϲον φραϲον η την παραβο των ζιζανι του αγρου

**English Translation**
Then leaving the crowds he entered into the house. And his disciples came came to him saying, Clarify explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A clear distinction is made between the crowds outside and the disciples who enter the house; understanding requires intimacy and withdrawal from the multitude. The disciples approach with a double plea to "clarify explain," specifically seeking the meaning of the tares. They bypass the mustard and the leaven to focus on the judgment of the field, showing their concern with the problem of evil and the fate of the wicked.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει ο ϲπιρων το καλον ϲπερμα εϲ ο του

**English Translation**
And answering he said, The one sowing the good seed is the [Son] of the [Man].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The identity of the Sower is established as the [Son] of the [Man]. The act of sowing is his prerogative, and the seed is defined as good precisely because it originates from his hand. He is the active agent who initiates the planting within the field.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αγροϲ εϲτιν ο κοϲμοϲ το δε καλον ϲπερμα ουτοι ειϲιν οι ϋϊ τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ τα δε ζιζανια ειϲιν οι ϋϊοι του πονη

**English Translation**
And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil [one].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world is the single vessel containing two distinct lineages. The sons of the kingdom are identified with the good seed, possessing a nature derived from the Sower. The tares are not merely bad seed but are identified as the progeny of the evil [one], existing alongside the sons of the kingdom in the same field.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εχθροϲ ο ϲπιραϲ αυτα εϲτ ο διαβολοϲ οι δε ο δε θεριϲμοϲ ϲυντελεια αιωνοϲ εϲτιν οι δε ο δε θεριϲμοϲ ϲυντελεια του αιωνοϲ εϲτιν οι δε θεριϲται αγγελοι ειϲιν

**English Translation**
And the enemy who sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the completion of the age; and the harvest is the completion of the age; and the reapers are angels.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The devil is named as the enemy responsible for the sowing of tares. The repetition of the definition of the harvest emphasizes the absolute certainty of the completion of the age. This completion is the appointed time for the angels to act as reapers, separating what grew together in the field.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
ωϲπερ ουν ϲυλλεγετε τα ζι και πυρι κα ουτωϲ ωᵨ εϲτε εν τη ϲυντε του αιωνοϲ

**English Translation**
Just as therefore the tares are gathered and burned with fire, so it shall be in the completion of the age.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gathering and the burning are the singular, inevitable destiny of the tares. The physical burning of weeds serves as the direct pattern for what occurs at the completion of the age. The fate of the tares is destruction by fire, distinguishing them finally from the wheat.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
αποϲτελι ο του α τουϲ αγγελουϲ και ϲυλλεξουϲιν εκ τηϲ βαϲιλιαϲ αυτου παντα τα ϲκανδαλα και τουϲ ποιουνταϲ την ανομιαν

**English Translation**
The [Son] of the [Man] will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all the stumbling blocks and those doing lawlessness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The angels belong to the [Son] of the [Man] and operate under his commission. The kingdom is purified by the removal of two things: the stumbling blocks that hinder others and the individuals who actively commit lawlessness. Sanctity requires the excision of that which causes offense.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
και βαλλουϲιν βαλουϲιν βαλουϲιν αυτουϲ ειϲ την καμινον του πυροϲ εκι εϲτε εϲται ο κλαυθμοϲ και ο βρυγμοϲ των οδ

**English Translation**
And they will cast, they will cast, they will cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be, shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the [teeth].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The threefold repetition of the act of casting confirms the violence and finality of the expulsion into the furnace. The location of judgment is defined by fire, and the condition of those within it is marked by the physical manifestations of anguish: weeping and the grinding of [teeth].

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
τοτε οι δικε δικαιοι εκλαμψουϲιν ωϲ ο ηλιοϲ εν τη βαϲιλεια του αυ ο εχων ωτα ακουε ακουετω

**English Translation**
Then the righteous, righteous will shine out like the sun in the kingdom of [Him]. The one having ears to hear, let him hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The righteous are revealed in glory comparable to the sun, illuminating the kingdom which belongs to [Him]. This shining is the result of the separation from the tares. The command to hear signifies that this truth requires spiritual attentiveness to be understood.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
ομοια δε εϲτιν η βαϲι βαϲιλεια των ο θηϲαυρω κεκρυμ εν τω αγρω ον ευρ ευρ α εκρυψεν κ(αι) απο τηϲ χαραϲ αυ ϋπαγι και πω παντα οϲα εχι και αγοραζει τον αγρον εκινον

**English Translation**
And like is the kingdom of the [heavens] to a treasure hidden in the field, which a [man] finding, found, and hid; and from his joy he goes and sells all, as much as he has, and buys that field.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The kingdom is concealed value waiting to be discovered. The [man] who finds it is moved by joy to total divestment, selling "all" that he possesses. The acquisition of the whole field is necessary to possess the hidden treasure, demonstrating that the kingdom requires the surrender of all other attachments.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
παλιν ομοια εϲτ εϲτ η βαϲιλια των ου ανθρωπω εμπορω ζητουντι καλουϲ μαργαριταϲ

**English Translation**
Again, like is, is the kingdom of the [heavens] to a man, a merchant, seeking good pearls.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double affirmation of likeness introduces the figure of the merchant. The kingdom is compared to one who is actively seeking what is good. The faithful man is characterized by this deliberate search for spiritual value among the wares of the world.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
ευρ ευρ δε ενα πολυτιμ μαργαριτην απελ πεπρακεν παντα οϲα ειχεν και ηγοραϲεν αυτ αυτ

**English Translation**
And finding, finding one very precious pearl, having gone away, he has sold all, as much as he had, and bought it, it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The discovery of the one precious pearl renders all other possessions redundant. The repetition of buying "it" emphasizes the singular focus of the exchange. He trades the multiplicity of "all" he had for the unity of the single pearl of great price.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
παλιν ομοια εϲτ η βαϲιλια των ου ϲαγηνη βληθιϲη ειϲ την θαλαϲϲαν και εκ παντοϲ γενουϲ ϲυναγαγουϲη

**English Translation**
Again, like is the kingdom of the [heavens] to a dragnet cast into the sea and gathering of every kind.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The kingdom operates as a net within the sea of the world. Its function is to gather comprehensively, collecting "every kind" without immediate sorting. The scope of the gathering is universal within the sea, encompassing all varieties of what is found there.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
ην οτε επληρωθη αναβιβαϲαντεϲ επι τον αιγιαλον και κ(αι) επι τον αιγιαλον επι τον αιγιαλον και καθιϲαντεϲ ϲυνελεξαν τα κα ειϲ αγγη τα δε ϲαπρα εξω εβαλλ εβαλ

**English Translation**
Which, when it was filled, having brought up onto the shore, and and onto the shore, onto the shore, and having sat down, they gathered the good into vessels, but the rotten they cast, cast out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The fullness of the net compels the movement to the shore, which serves as the boundary of judgment. The repeated mention of the shore underscores the transition from the sea to the place of decision. The separation is absolute: the good are preserved in vessels, while the rotten are rejected and cast out.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ εϲτε εν τη ϲυντελια του αιω εξελευϲον οι αγγελοι και α τουϲ πο εκ μεϲου των δικαιων

**English Translation**
So shall it be in the consummation of the age: the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from the midst of the righteous.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The present state involves a mixture, but the consummation brings a divine severance. It is the angels who act as the agents of this final ordering, removing the wicked who currently exist within the midst of the righteous. The separation is not man’s to perform, but awaits the appointed end of the age.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
και βαλλουϲιν βαλουϲιν βαλουϲιν αυτουϲ ειϲ την καμινον του πυροϲ εκει ε ο κλαυθμοϲ και ο βρυγμοϲ τ τ οδοντων

**English Translation**
And they cast, they will cast, they will cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The threefold repetition of the act of casting emphasizes the certainty and the terrifying finality of the judgment. There is no return from this furnace. The weeping signifies sorrow, and the gnashing of teeth signifies the despair of those who realize their loss when the time for repentance has passed.

**Verse 51**
**Greek Text**
ϲυνη ταυτα παντα ˙ λεγουϲιν αυτω ναι

**English Translation**
Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord requires not merely the hearing of parables but the understanding of them. The assent of the disciples confirms that the mysteries of the kingdom are intelligible to those to whom it is given. Their "Yes" binds them to the responsibility of this knowledge.

**Verse 52**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ δια τουτο παϲ γραμ μαθητευ τη βαϲιλια τ τ ουρανων ομοια ομοιοϲ ομοιοϲ εϲτιν α οικο οϲτιϲ εκ εκ του θηϲαυ αυτου καινα και παλαια

**English Translation**
And he said to them: Therefore every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like, like, like a man, a house-master, who bringeth forth out of, out of his treasure things new and old.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "like" and "out of" underscores the abundance and the identity of the true teacher. The scribe of the kingdom does not discard the old covenants but brings them forth alongside the new revelations of the Gospel. He is a master of a house who possesses a unified treasure, demonstrating the harmony of the ancient law and the new grace.

**Verse 53**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο οτε ε ο ταϲ παραβολαϲ ταυταϲ μετηρεν εκιθεν

**English Translation**
And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The teaching concludes, and the action moves forward. The finishing of the parables marks a transition from instruction to the next phase of his ministry. He does not linger where the word is completed but departs to carry the presence elsewhere.

**Verse 54**
**Greek Text**
και ελθων ειϲ τ τ αντιπατριδα πατριδα αυτου εδιδαϲκεν αυτουϲ εν τη ϲυναγωγη αυτων ωϲτε εκ αυτουϲ και λεγειν ποθ τουτω η ϲοφια αυτη και αι δυνα

**English Translation**
And coming into the Antipatris, his country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said: Whence hath this man this wisdom and the powers?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He enters his own territory, here termed Antipatris his country, and teaches in the assembly. The people are struck by the wisdom and the powers manifested, yet they interrogate the source. They acknowledge the supernatural effects but stumble over the origin, unable to reconcile the visible man with the divine authority.

**Verse 55**
**Greek Text**
ουχ ουτοϲ ε ο του τεκτο ουχ η μ αυτου λεγετε μα και οι αδελ αυτου ϊακω και ϊωϲηφ ϊωαννηϲ και ϲιμων και ιου

**English Translation**
Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James and Joseph, John and Simon and Judas?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd seeks to diminish his authority by listing his earthly connections: the carpenter, his mother Mary, and his brothers—James, Joseph, John, Simon, and Judas. They enumerate the flesh to deny the Spirit. By naming his kin, they attempt to confine the Infinite within the boundaries of a known family.

**Verse 56**
**Greek Text**
και αι αδελφαι αυτου ουχι παϲαι προϲ ημαϲ ειϲιν ποθεν ουν τουτω ταυτα παντα

**English Translation**
And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of his sisters among the people serves as a stumbling block to their faith. They reason that if his kin are common and present, his power must have an explainable, earthly origin. The question "Whence?" reveals their inability to perceive that "all these things" come from the Father, not from his earthly lineage.

**Verse 57**
**Greek Text**
και ε εν αυτω ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ ουκ εϲτιν προφη ατιμοϲ ει μη εν τη ϊδια πατριδι και εν τη οικια αυ

**English Translation**
And they were scandalized in him. But he said to them: A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country and in his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Familiarity breeds scandal rather than faith. The prophet receives honor externally, but within his own borders and house, he is despised. The proximity of the divine messenger to his own people hardens their hearts, as they look upon the vessel and reject the treasure it contains.

**Verse 58**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ εποιη εκι δυναμιϲ πολλαϲ δια την απιϲτιαν αυτων

**English Translation**
And he did not do many powers there because of their unbelief.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The flow of divine power is arrested by the barrier of human unbelief. It is not that the power was lacking in him, but that their refusal to believe closed the door to its operation. Faith is the requisite vessel for the reception of miracles; without it, the work remains undone.
