**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
οψε δε ϲαββατων τη επιφωϲκουϲη ειϲ μιαν ϲαββατ ηλθεν μαριαμʼ η μαγδαληνη · και η αλλη μαρια · θεω τον ταφ

**English Translation**
Now late on the Sabbaths, as it was dawning toward the first of the Sabbaths, came Mariam the Magdalene and the other Maria to view the grave.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The observance of the old rest fades as the new day begins to dawn. The women approach the place of death not to anoint the body but simply to view the grave, maintaining a vigil of sight at the boundary between the Sabbath silence and the coming light.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ϲιϲμοϲ ε μεγαϲ · αγ γαρ κατα εξ ο ο και προϲελθων απε τον λιθ και εκαθητο ε αυτου

**English Translation**
And behold, a great earthquake occurred; for a messenger descending from heaven and approaching rolled away the stone and sat upon it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The earth shakes in response to the descent of authority from heaven. The stone, intended to seal the dead within the earth, becomes a seat for the messenger, demonstrating that the barrier of the grave is now subject to the one who sits in triumph.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ην δε η ειδεα αυτου ωϲ αϲτραπη και το αυτου λευ ωϲ η χιων

**English Translation**
Now his appearance was as lightning, and his [garment] white as snow.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The messenger bears the terrifying brilliance of lightning, illuminating the darkness of the tomb with sudden power. The whiteness like snow signifies a purity originating from above, untouched by the corruption of the earth or the decay of the grave.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
απο δε του φοβου αυ εϲιϲθηϲαν οι τηρουντεϲ και ε ωϲ νεκροι

**English Translation**
And from fear of him the keepers were shaken and became as dead men.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Those commissioned to guard the dead are themselves struck with the stillness of death. The terror of the divine presence incapacitates the strong, rendering the living guards indistinguishable from the corpses they were set to watch.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο αγγελοϲ ειπεν ταιϲ γυναιξιν μη φοβηθηται φοβιϲθαι ϋμιϲ · οιδα γαρ οτι τον εϲταυρω ζητειτε ˙

**English Translation**
But answering, the angel said to the women, "Do not fear, you; for I know that you seek the one having been crucified."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The angel draws a sharp distinction between the guards and the women; the former freeze in terror, while the latter are commanded to cast off fear. Their seeking of the crucified one serves as the ground for their courage, for devotion to the cross invites divine reassurance.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ουκ εϲτιν ωδε · η γαρ καθωϲ ειπεν δευτε ειδε τον τοπον οπου εκειτο ·

**English Translation**
He is not here; for he was raised, just as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The absence of the body serves as the proof of the resurrection. The invitation to inspect the empty place validates the word he had previously spoken, confirming that the physical reality now aligns with his promise.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και ταχυ πορευθιϲαι ειπα τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου οτι ηγερθη απο των νεκρ νεκρ και ϊδου προαγει ϋμαϲ ειϲ την γαλι εκει αυτ αυτ οψεϲθαι · ϊδου ει ειπον υμιν

**English Translation**
And going quickly, say to his disciples that he was raised from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I told you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command necessitates haste; the news of the rising cannot wait. The location of the promised sight is set in Galilee, directing the disciples back to the place of their calling, while the angelic declaration stands as a sealed testimony given before the event occurs.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και απελθουϲαι ταχυ απο του μνη μετα φοβου και χαραϲ μεγαληϲ εδραμον απαγγι τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
And departing quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report to his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The women are propelled from the place of death by a paradox of emotions. Great joy mingles with fear, driving their feet to run as the first bearers of the message to the waiting disciples.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου υπηντη απηντηϲεν αυταιϲ λεγ χαιρετε αι δε προϲ εκρατη αυτου τουϲ πο και προϲεκυ αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And behold, he met them, saying, "Rejoice." And approaching, they took hold of his feet and worshiped him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The risen Lord intercepts their path with a greeting of grace. By grasping his feet, the women confirm the tangible reality of his body, refuting any thought of a mere spirit, and offer the worship due to the victor.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγει αυταιϲ ο μη φοβειϲθε ϋπαγεται απαγγι τοιϲ αδελφοιϲ μου ϊνα ελθωϲιν απελθωϲιν ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν και εκει με οψονται

**English Translation**
Then [Jesus] says to them, "Do not fear; go, report to my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He elevates the disciples to the status of "brothers," signaling restoration despite their desertion. The instruction reinforces Galilee as the appointed theater for the revelation of his glory to the community.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
πορευομενων δε αυτων ϊδου τι τηϲ κουϲτω ελθοντεϲ ειϲ την πολιν ανηγ τοιϲ αρχϊε απαντα τα γενομενα

**English Translation**
Now as they were going, behold, some of the guard coming into the city reported to the high priests all the things that had happened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the women carry the truth of life to the brothers, the guards carry the facts of the event to the adversaries. The testimony of the miracle is delivered directly to the religious authorities, leaving them without ignorance regarding the empty tomb.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυναχθεντεϲ μετα των πρεϲβυ ϲυμβουλι τε εποιηϲαν εποιηϲαν κ(αι) λαβοντεϲ λαβοντεϲ εποιηϲαν κ(αι) λαβοντεϲ αργυρια ϊκανα ε τοιϲ ϲτρα

**English Translation**
And having gathered with the elders and having taken counsel, and having taken sufficient silver pieces, they gave [them] to the soldiers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The assembly gathers not to seek the truth but to manufacture a plot. They utilize silver to suppress the report of the miracle, attempting to purchase silence and obscure the divine act with material corruption.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ οτι ειπατε οι μαθη αυτου νυκτοϲ ελθοντεϲ εκλε αυτον ημ κοιμωμενων ˙

**English Translation**
Saying, "Say that 'His disciples coming by night stole him while we were sleeping.'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They command the soldiers to spread a lie that confesses their own negligence. The fabrication requires the guards to claim knowledge of events that supposedly transpired while they were asleep, exchanging their military honor for the denial of the resurrection.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και εαν ακουϲθη τουτο επι του η ημειϲ πειϲομεν και ϋ αμεριμνουϲ ποιηϲωμεν

**English Translation**
And if this is heard before the governor, we will persuade [him] and make you free from worry.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authorities promise political protection to shield the soldiers from the consequences of the lie. They presume the ability to manipulate the governor's judgment, ensuring that the admitted failure of duty brings no punishment.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
οι δε λαβοντεϲ τα αρ εποιηϲαν ωϲ καθωϲ εδιδαχθηϲαν και εφημιϲθη ο λογοϲ ουτοϲ πα ϊουδαιοιϲ εωϲ μεχρι τηϲ ϲημερον

**English Translation**
So taking the silver [pieces], they did as they were taught; and this word was spread abroad among Jews until this day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The soldiers act according to their payment rather than the truth they witnessed. The persistence of this false report testifies to the enduring conflict between the proclaimed gospel and the orchestrated denial among the people.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ενδεκα μαθη επορευθηϲαν ειϲ την γαλιλαι γαλιλαι ειϲ το οροϲ ου ε αυτοιϲ ο

**English Translation**
But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where [Jesus] had appointed them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The group is reduced to eleven, marking the absence of the betrayer. Their obedience in traveling to the specific mountain places them in the ordained position to receive the final commission from their Lord.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδοντεϲ αυτ προϲεκυνηϲαν οι δε εδιϲταϲαν ·

**English Translation**
And seeing him, they worshiped; but some doubted.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Worship is the immediate response to the sight of the risen one, yet hesitation lingers in some. The presence of doubt within the circle of the eleven reveals that faith must grapple with the magnitude of the revelation even while standing before the divine reality.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων ο ελαληϲεν αυτοιϲ λε εδοθη μοι παϲα εξουϲια εν ουρανω και επι γηϲ ·

And approaching, [Jesus] spoke to them, saying, "All authority was given to me in heaven and on earth."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He draws near to bridge the distance of their doubt. The declaration of universal authority unites the heavens and the earth under his single dominion, establishing the absolute foundation for the command he is about to issue.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
πορευθεντεϲ μαθητευϲατε π τα εθνη βαπτι αυτουϲ · ειϲ το ονομα του π και του ϋϊου και του αγιου ˙

**English Translation**
Going, make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy [Spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mission expands from the confines of the mountain to encompass all nations. The singular name signifies the unity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy, into which the nations are to be immersed through baptism.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
διδαϲκοντεϲ αυ τηριν παντα οϲα ενετιλαμην ϋμιν και ϊδου εγω ειμι μεθ υμων παϲαϲ ταϲ ημε εωϲ τηϲ ϲυν του αιω ·:· ⌇﹏
