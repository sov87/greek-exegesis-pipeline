**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εμβαϲ ειϲ πλοι διεπεραϲεν κ(αι) ηλθεν ειϲ την ϊ πολιν

**English Translation**
And stepping into [a] boat, he crossed over and came into [his] own city.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord departs and returns, sanctifying movement by his presence. He enters "his own city," showing that while the Creator owns the whole earth, he accepts a specific earthly dwelling to manifest his nearness to humanity. The crossing over the water signifies the transition from the miracles of the deep to the ministry within the habitations of men.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου προϲεφε αυτω παραλυ επι κλινηϲ βεβλημενον · και ειδων ο την πι αυτων ειπεν τω παραλυτικω θαρϲει τεκνον α ϲου αι αμαρ

**English Translation**
And behold, they brought to him [a] paralytic lying on [a] bed; and seeing the faith of them, he said to the paralytic, "Take courage, child, [forgiven are] your sins."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine sight: he sees "faith," a quality usually invisible to the eye, proving he is the Searcher of hearts. He addresses the root of human misery first; before the limbs are straightened, the soul is unburdened. By calling the man "child," he grants adoption and intimacy, showing that the forgiveness of sins is the restoration of paternal relationship.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου τινεϲ τ τ γραμματεων ει εν εαυτοιϲ ου βλαϲφημει

**English Translation**
And behold, some of the scribes said within themselves, "[This man] blasphemes."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusation is hidden "within themselves," yet it is a loud cry to the ears of God. They recognize that forgiveness belongs to the Divine alone, yet their error lies in failing to see the Divine standing before them. They judge the Lawgiver by the standard of their own limited understanding of the Law.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδων ο ταϲ αυτων ειπεν ϊνατι ενθυ πονηρα εν ταιϲ καρδιεϲ καρδιαιϲ ϋ

**English Translation**
And seeing their [thoughts], he said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He answers their unspoken thoughts, a miracle no less potent than healing the body. By revealing the secrets of their "hearts," he demonstrates the very authority they questioned. The "evil" is not in their logic, but in the malice of their intent and their refusal to recognize the time of their visitation.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
τι γαρ εϲτιν ευκοπωτερον ει αφιονται αφιενται ϲου αι αμαρτιαι η ειπειν εγειρε κ(αι) περι

**English Translation**
For which is easier, to say, 'Forgiven are your sins,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He juxtaposes the invisible spiritual reality with the visible physical action. To the human mind, words of forgiveness are easy because they cannot be tested; to the Divine, both require the same omnipotence. He uses the command to "rise" as the visible seal of the invisible absolution.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ϊνα δε ειδητε οτι εξουϲιαν εχι ο του επι τηϲ γηϲ αφιεναι αμαρτιαϲ τοτε λεγει τω παρα εγερθειϲ αρον ϲου την κλι και πορευου υπαγε ειϲ τον οικον ϲου

**English Translation**
"But that you may know that the [Son] of [Man] has authority on earth to forgive sins"—then he says to the paralytic—"Having arisen, take up your bed and go into your house."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The title "[Son] of [Man]" bridges the gap between the heavenly court and the dust of the "earth." The authority is brought down to where men live. The command to "take up" the bed turns the evidence of his former weakness into a trophy of his restoration; he carries that which once carried him.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και εγερθειϲ απηλ ειϲ τον οικον αυτου

**English Translation**
And having arisen, he went away into his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Obedience is immediate, authenticating the cure. The return to "his house" signifies the restoration of the man to his proper place in the community and family. The miracle does not merely amaze the crowd; it restores the order of creation within the domestic sphere.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ϊδοντεϲ δε οι οχλοι εφοβηθηϲαν κ(αι) εδοξαϲαν τον τον δοντα εξουϲι τοιαυτην τοιϲ α

**English Translation**
But seeing [it], the crowds feared and glorified God, the [one] having given such authority to men.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear is the beginning of wisdom; the crowds are struck with holy dread before the manifestation of power. They glorify God, yet their understanding is partial, for they marvel that such authority is given to "men," not grasping that the One before them is the God-Man.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και παραγων ο εκιθ ειδεν α α εκι καθη επι το τε μαθθαι λεγομενον κ(αι) λεγι αυτω ακολου μοι και αναϲταϲ ηκολουθει αυτω

**English Translation**
And passing by from there, [Jesus] saw a man sitting at the tax booth, called Matthew, and says to him, "Follow me." And having arisen, he followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gaze of mercy falls upon the despised tax collector. The call "Follow me" is creative, like the command "Let there be light," imparting the power to obey. Matthew leaves the seat of greed to follow the seat of Wisdom, showing that no occupation or past sin places a man beyond the reach of the calling voice.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ανακειμεν κ(αι) εγενετο ανακιμενου αυτου εν τη οικια ϊδου πολλοι τελωνε τελωναι και αμαρτωλοι ϲυ ελθοντεϲ ϲυνανεκιντο τω και τοιϲ μαθητεϲ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And it came to pass, as he was reclining in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners, coming together, were reclining with [Jesus] and his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "house" becomes a sanctuary where the unclean are made clean by association with the Holy One. He does not fear contamination from "sinners," for Light dispels darkness. The table fellowship signifies the gathering of the nations and the outcast into the new covenant.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδοντεϲ οι φαριϲαιοι ελεγ τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυ δια τι μετα των τελωνων και α εϲθι ο διδαϲκαλοϲ ϋμων

**English Translation**
And seeing [it], the Pharisees said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisees judge by the exterior law of separation. They question the "disciples" to sow doubt about the "teacher." They perceive eating as a defilement, failing to see it as a medicine being administered to the sick by the Great Physician.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ακουϲαϲ ειπ ου χριαν εχουϲ οι ϊϲχυοντεϲ ϊατρ ϊατρ αλλ οι κακωϲ εχ εχ

**English Translation**
But hearing [it], he said, "The strong have no need of a physician, but those having [sickness]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He declares the nature of his incarnation: he is the Physician of souls. Those who think themselves "strong" shut themselves out from grace by their own pride. It is the acknowledgement of being in a "bad" state that draws the healing art of God; to confess one's sickness is the first step toward health.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
πορευθεντεϲ δε μαθεται τι εϲτ εϲτ ελεοϲ θελω και ου θυϲιαν ου γαρ ηλ καλεϲαι δικαι αλλα αμαρτω

**English Translation**
But having gone learn what is, is mercy I will, and not sacrifice; for I came not to call righteous [ones] but sinners.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord commands us to depart from ignorance and learn the nature of divine existence. The text repeats "what is" (*ti est est*), emphasizing that the very being of God’s will is mercy. Mercy is not merely an act but the substance of what He desires, standing in opposition to empty ritual sacrifice. He defines His mission clearly: He has arrived in the flesh not for those who claim righteousness, but specifically to summon the sinner to this reality of mercy.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲερ αυτω οι μαθηται ϊωαν λεγοντεϲ δι τι ημιϲ και οι φα νηϲτευο πυκνα πολλα οι δε μαθη ϲου ου νηϲτευ

**English Translation**
Then approach him the disciples of John saying, Why [do] we and the Pharisees fast often many [times], but your disciples do not fast?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples of John align themselves with the Pharisees, burdened by the weight of their observances, described here as "often many." This phrasing suggests a multiplication of ritual labor, a heaviness of practice that they contrast with the freedom of the Lord’s disciples. They seek a reason for this discrepancy, perceiving their own abundant fasting as a standard that the Lord’s followers fail to meet.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο μη δυνανται οι ϋϊοι του νυμφω πενθειν ε οϲον μετ αυτ εϲτιν ο νυμφι ελευϲονται δε ημεραι οταν απαρθη απ αυ ο νυμφειοϲ και τοτε νηϲτευ

**English Translation**
And he said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as with them is the bridegroom; but days will come when is taken away from them the bridegroom, and then they will fast.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of the Bridegroom defines the era; it is a time of nuptial joy, not mourning. The "sons of the bridechamber" are exempt from the sorrow of fasting while the union is manifest. Yet, the Lord prophesies a future separation, a removal of the Bridegroom, which will inaugurate the proper season for fasting. The discipline of the body is thus regulated by the presence or absence of the divine Spouse.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ουδειϲ δε επιβαλ επιβλημα ρα αγναφου ε ϊματιω παλεω αιρι γαρ το πληρω αυτου απο του ϊματιου και χειρον ϲχιϲμα γεινεται

**English Translation**
But no one puts a patch of uncarded cloth on an old garment; for takes away its fullness from the garment, and a worse tear becomes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord warns against mixing the new power of grace with the old, worn structures of the law. The "uncarded" or raw cloth possesses a strength and fullness that the old garment cannot sustain. To attempt such a union is destructive; the new does not heal the old but tears it further, revealing the incompatibility of the dead letter with the living spirit.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ουδε βαλλουϲιν οι νεον ειϲ αϲκουϲ παλαιουϲ ει δε μη γε ρηγνυνται οι α και ο οινοϲ εκ και οι αϲκοι απολλυνται αλλ οινον νεον ειϲ αϲκουϲ καινουϲ βλητεον και αμ ϲυντηρο

**English Translation**
Nor do they put wine new into wineskins old; otherwise burst the [skins] and the wine [spills out] and the wineskins are destroyed; but wine new into wineskins new one must put, and both are preserved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The new wine of the Gospel requires a new vessel, a renewed humanity, to contain it. The old skins, brittle and unyielding, cannot withstand the fermentation and life of the spirit. Ruin awaits those who try to confine this new power within ancient forms; both the doctrine and the recipient are lost. Preservation is found only when the vessel is made new to match the newness of the wine.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ταυτα αυτου λαλο αυτοιϲ ϊδου αρ προϲελθ ειϲ προϲελθ ειϲελθ προϲεκυνι αυτω λεγων η θυγατηρ μου αρτι ετελευ αλλα ελθ επιθεϲ την χει ϲου επ αυτην και ζηϲεται

**English Translation**
These things [while] he speaking to them, behold a ruler having come to, one having come to, entered, worshipped him saying, My daughter just now died; but come lay your hand upon her and she will live.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the Lord speaks of new wine, a ruler intrudes with a plea of life and death. The text stammers—"having come to, one having come to, entered"—reflecting the urgency and agitation of the man. His faith is precise: though death has occurred, the imposition of the Lord's hand is sufficient to reverse it. He acknowledges Jesus as the source of life who can command the dead to live.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και εγερθειϲ ο ηκολουθει αυτω και οι μαθηται αυ

**English Translation**
And having risen he followed him and his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord responds immediately, rising from his teaching to perform the work of mercy. The action follows the petition without delay. He is accompanied by his disciples, who must witness that the Master is not only a teacher of wisdom but the Lord of life.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου γυνη αιμαροουϲα αιμοροουϲα δω ετη προϲελ οπιϲθεν ηψατο του κραϲπε του ϊματιου αυτου

**English Translation**
And behold a woman flowing blood, flowing blood [twelve] years, having come behind touched the fringe of his garment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition in the text, "flowing blood, flowing blood," emphasizes the unceasing nature of her affliction. For many years she has suffered this drainage of life. Unworthy to face Him, she approaches from behind, seeking contact with the mere fringe of His garment, believing that holiness permeates even his vestments.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ελεγεν γαρ εν εαυτη εαν α μονον αψωμαι του ϊματι αυτου ϲωθηϲο

**English Translation**
For she said in herself, If only I touch his garment, I shall be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Her dialogue is internal; she speaks "in herself." Faith precedes the miracle. She requires no word or look from Him, only physical contact with what is His. She is convinced that salvation is objective and tangible, accessible even through the hem of His robe.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ϲτραφειϲ και ϊδων αυτην ειπ θαρϲι θυγατερ η πι ϲου ϲεϲωκεν ϲε και εϲωθη η γυ απο τηϲ ωραϲ εκινηϲ

**English Translation**
But he having turned and seeing her said, Take courage, daughter; your faith has saved you. And the woman was saved from that hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord exposes her secret act but comforts her fear, calling her "daughter." He clarifies that it was not magic in the garment, but her faith that facilitated the cure. The healing is instantaneous, marked from that very hour, confirming the power of faith to draw virtue from the Lord.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και ελθ ο ειϲ την οικι του αρχοντοϲ και ϊδων τουϲ ︴ αυλη και τον οχλον θορυβουμενον

**English Translation**
And having come into the house of the ruler and seeing the [ones in the] court and the crowd making a tumult...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Entering the place of death, the Lord encounters the chaos of mourning. The text indicates the presence of those in the court and a noisy crowd, signaling the social reality of death—a spectacle of noise and despair. The Lord enters this tumult as the agent of peace and order.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
ελεγεν αναχωρι ου γαρ απεθαν το κοραϲιον αλλα καθευδει και κατε αυτου ειδο οτι απεθανεν

**English Translation**
He said, Withdraw; for the girl did not die but sleeps. And they derided him, knowing that she died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ redefines death as sleep, for to Him, resurrection is as simple as waking. He commands the mourners to withdraw, for their noisy despair has no place where the Life is present. They mock Him, relying on their human knowledge ("knowing that she died"), blind to the divine authority that stands before them, ready to undo the finality of death.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
οτε δε εξεβληθη ο οχλοϲ ειϲελθ εκρατηϲεν τηϲ χιροϲ αυτηϲ και η το κοραϲι

**English Translation**
But when the crowd was cast out, having entered, he took hold of her hand, and the girl arose.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To restore life, the tumult of the faithless crowd must first be expelled. The Lord enters the chamber of death only when the mockers are removed, demonstrating that the mystery of resurrection requires the silence of reverence. He does not heal from a distance but takes hold of her hand, transmitting life through contact, so that the flesh which was dead responds immediately to the touch of its Creator.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και εξηλθεν η φημη αυτηϲ ειϲ ολην την γην ε

**English Translation**
And the report of this went out into all that land.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Though the miracle occurs in the privacy of the chamber, the truth of it cannot be contained by walls. The report goes out not by human design but by the inherent power of the act itself. The fame spreads into the entire land, testifying that the authority over death is now present among men.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και παραγοντι εκει τω ηκολου αυτω δυο τυφλοι κραυγαζ και λεγοντεϲ ελεηϲον ημαϲ ϋϊε

**English Translation**
And as he passed by there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, Have mercy on us, Son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
These men, though bereft of sight, perceive the reality of the Lord better than those who see. By addressing him simply as "Son," they acknowledge a lineage and authority that demands mercy. They follow him not by vision but by the sound of his passing, proving that faith is an inner illumination that guides the feet even when the eyes are darkened.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ειϲελθοντι ελθοντι δε αυτω ειϲ την οι προϲηλθον αυτω οι δυο τυφλοι και λεγει αυτοιϲ ο πι οτι δυνα υμιν τουτο ποι λεγουϲιν αυ ναι

**English Translation**
And having entered into the house, the two blind men came to him; and Jesus says to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord retreats to the house to test the persistence of their faith. He demands a verbal confession, not because he is ignorant of their hearts, but because salvation requires the active assent of the will. He asks if they believe he has the power "to do this," forcing them to articulate their hope that the Creator can restore what is lacking in nature.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
τοτε η των οφθαλ αυτων λεγ κατα την πιϲτιν ϋμων γενηθητω ϋμιν

**English Translation**
Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith let it be done to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cure is measured out in proportion to their trust. The Lord touches the organ that is dead, and his word establishes the condition for its restoration. He does not say "according to my power," which is infinite, but "according to your faith," making the recipient a participant in the miracle through their capacity to believe.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και ανεω αυτων οι οφθαλ και ενεβριμηθη αυτοιϲ ο λεγ ορατε μηδιϲ γινω

**English Translation**
And their eyes were opened; and Jesus sternly charged them, saying, See that no one knows.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Light floods their eyes immediately upon the word. Yet, the Lord responds with a stern charge for silence, guarding the mystery of his work from premature or sensational proclamation. He seeks to heal the soul through humility and obedience, prohibiting the very publicity that worldly men seek.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
οι δε εξελ διεφημι αυτον εν ολη τη γη εκεινη

**English Translation**
But they, having gone out, spread his fame in all that land.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Gratitude overwhelms obedience. They are unable to hide the gift of sight, for the change in their nature serves as a witness they cannot suppress. While they transgress the command to be silent, their action reveals that the glory of God, once received, compels the creature to speak.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
αυτων δε εξερχο ϊδου προϲ αυτω κω δαιμονιζομε

**English Translation**
And as they were going out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed by a demon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The enemy attacks human nature in manifold ways; as the blind depart, the mute arrives. This man cannot cry out for mercy like the previous two, for the demon has bound his tongue. He relies entirely on the charity of those who bring him, showing that the church must often carry those who are spiritually silenced by evil to the feet of the Savior.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και εκβληθ του δαιμονιου ελαληϲεν ο κω και εθαυμα οι οχλοι λεγ ουδεποτε εφα ουτωϲ εν τω

**English Translation**
And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, Never was it seen thus in Israel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Speech returns the moment the diabolical presence is expelled. The faculty of speech is natural to man; it is the intruder that suppresses it. The crowd confesses that a new era has dawned in Israel, for the authority to liberate the tongue and banish spirits exceeds all historical precedent in their nation.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
οι δε φαριϲαι ελεγον εν τω αρχ αρχ των δαιμονι εκβαλλει τα δεμονια

**English Translation**
But the Pharisees said, By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Confronted with undeniable power, the Pharisees retreat into blasphemy. Unable to deny the miracle, they malign the source, attributing the work of light to the prince of darkness. This reveals the hardness of their hearts: they prefer to credit the devil with the power of healing rather than submit to the authority of the Lord.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και περιηγεν ο ταϲ πολιϲ παϲαϲ και ταϲ κωμαϲ δι εν ταιϲ ϲυναγωγαιϲ αυτ αυτων κ(αι) κηρυϲϲων το ευ τηϲ βα και θερα παϲαν νο και παϲαν μα εν τω λαω και ηκολουθηϲ αυτω

**English Translation**
And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people; and they followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord is indefatigable in his visitation, entering both structured cities and humble villages. He combines the illumination of the mind through teaching with the restoration of the body through healing. The text notes that they followed him, indicating that the demonstration of power and the proclamation of the kingdom create a flock that trails after the Shepherd.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε τουϲ οχλουϲ εϲπλαγχνιϲθη περι αυτων οτι η εϲκυλμενοι και εριμμενοι ω προβατα μη ε ποιμενα

**English Translation**
But seeing the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and thrown down, as sheep having no shepherd.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine gaze perceives the true spiritual condition of the people. They are not merely a crowd but a ravaged flock, distressed and prostrate. His compassion is not a fleeting emotion but a theological recognition of their need for a ruler. The absence of a true shepherd leaves the soul exposed to every predator, necessitating the intervention of the One who gathers the scattered.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγι τοιϲ μα αυτου ο μ θεριϲμοϲ πολυϲ οι δε εργατε ολιγοι

**English Translation**
Then he says to his disciples, The harvest indeed is much, but the workers are few.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He directs his speech to those who learn from him, drawing their eyes to the vastness of the standing crop. The field is not empty but full of souls ready for the gathering, yet the abundance of the yield stands in contrast to the poverty of the labor force. He reveals that the limitation lies not in the grace of the season, which is plentiful, but in the scarcity of those willing to endure the heat of the work.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
δεηθητε ουν του του θεριϲμου οπωϲ εκβαλη ερ ειϲ τον θε αυτου :

**English Translation**
Beseech therefore the [Lord] of the harvest, so that he might cast out workers into his harvest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Since the laborers are few, the command is given to petition the one who possesses the authority over the field. We do not gather workers by human persuasion but beg the master of the crop to act. The verb signifies a forceful thrusting out; he must drive the laborers forth from their inactivity into the urgency of the task. The harvest belongs solely to him, and only by his power are workers sent into what is his own.
