**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ομοιωθηϲεται η βαϲιλεια των ου δεκα παρθε αιτινεϲ λαβου ταϲ λαμπαδαϲ αυτων εξηλθον ειϲ ϋπαντηϲιν του νυμφιου

**English Translation**
Then the kingdom of the heavens shall be likened to ten virgins, who having taken their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The kingdom of the heavens is here set forth as a state of expectation and movement. These ten virgins do not remain static but take up their lamps, indicating that illumination is required for the journey. Their departure signifies a deliberate separation from the mundane to engage in a sacred encounter, for the entire purpose of their going out is the meeting with the bridegroom.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
πεντε δε εξ αυτων ηϲαν μωραι και πεντε > φρονιμοι

**English Translation**
And five of them were foolish and five prudent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred text divides the company not by their destination or their initial action, for all ten went out, but by their interior disposition. The distinction lies between the foolish and the prudent; one group possesses the foresight necessary for the kingdom, while the other lacks the wisdom to sustain their purpose.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
αι γαρ μω λαβουϲαι ταϲ λαμ ουκ ελαβον μεθ εαυτων ελαι

**English Translation**
For the foolish, having taken the lamps, did not take oil with themselves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is revealed the precise nature of their folly: they possess the form without the substance. They grasp the lamps, the external vessels of light, yet they neglect the oil which fuels the flame. To carry the instrument of illumination without the source of its life is a vanity that renders the bearer unprepared for the duration of the wait.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
αι δε φρονιμοι ελα ελαιον εν τοιϲ αγγιοιϲ μετα των λαμπαδων εαυτ εαυτ

**English Translation**
But the prudent took oil in the vessels with their own lamps.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Prudence is demonstrated in the redundancy of provision. These wise ones do not rely solely on the moment but secure oil in vessels alongside their lamps, ensuring that the light can be sustained. They understand that the meeting with the bridegroom requires an enduring supply, and thus they carry within themselves the capacity for persistence.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
χρονιζοντοϲ δε > του νυμφιου ενυ παϲαι και εκαθευδον

**English Translation**
Now the bridegroom delaying, they all slumbered and slept.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The delay of the bridegroom serves as a trial of patience, yet the weakness of the flesh touches all alike. Neither the foolish nor the prudent are exempt from the heaviness of waiting, for every one of them slumbered and slept. The difference in their condition is not found in their wakefulness during the delay, but in their readiness prior to the repose.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
μεϲηϲ δε νυκτοϲ κραυγη γεγονεν ϊδου ο νυμ εξερχεϲθε ειϲ απαντηϲιν

**English Translation**
But at the middle of the night a cry happened: Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The summons arrives at the extremity of darkness, the middle of the night, shattering the silence with a cry. This sudden proclamation demands an immediate response: "Behold, the bridegroom." The command to come out to the meeting permits no hesitation, revealing that the time for preparation has passed and the time for presence has begun.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ηγερθηϲαν πα αι παρθενοι εκει και εκοϲμηϲ ταϲ λαμπαδαϲ εαυ

**English Translation**
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The awakening is universal; all the virgins rise from their sleep to attend to their duty. The act of trimming their lamps signifies the attempt to bring forth light for the encounter. It is in this moment of rising and ordering the lamps that the hidden reality of their provision—or lack thereof—becomes manifest.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
αι δε μωραι ταιϲ φρονιμοιϲ ειπον δοτε ημιν εκ του ελαιου ϋμων οτι αι λαμπαδεϲ ημ ϲβεννυνται

**English Translation**
And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The deficiency of the foolish is now exposed by the demand of the hour. Seeing their lamps being quenched, they seek to borrow from the abundance of others. They acknowledge their need for oil too late, attempting to rely on the resources of the prudent when they should have secured their own sustenance.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲαν δε αι φρονιμοι λεγουϲαι μηποτε ουκ αρκε ϋμιν και ημιν πορευεϲθε μαλλ προϲ τουϲ πωλο και αγοραϲατε εαυταιϲ

**English Translation**
But the prudent answered saying, Lest there be not enough for us and you; go rather to those selling and buy for yourselves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prudent refuse not out of malice but out of necessity, for the oil required for the meeting is not transferable. There is a sufficiency only for those who have prepared, and to divide it would leave both groups in darkness. The instruction to go to those selling and buy highlights that the acquisition of this grace is a personal labor that cannot be fulfilled by another at the crisis.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
απερχομε δε αυτων αγο ηλθεν ο νυμ και αι ετοιμοι ειϲηλθον μετ αυ ειϲ τουϲ γαμουϲ και εκλιϲθη η θυρα

**English Translation**
And while they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those ready went in with him to the wedding feasts, and the door was shut.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The arrival of the bridegroom is definitive and intersects the actions of the virgins. Those who were ready entered immediately into the joy of the wedding feasts, united with him. The shutting of the door marks the absolute boundary of the kingdom; once the bridegroom has received the prepared, the opportunity for entry ceases, and the division is sealed.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ϋϲτερον δε ερχον και αι λοιπαι παρ λεγουϲαι ανοιξον η ˙

**English Translation**
And afterwards come also the remaining virgins, saying, Open to us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The return of the remaining virgins is futile, for they arrive after the decisive moment. Their plea, "Open to us," expresses a desire for admission that is no longer granted. Their identity as virgins remains, but their status as excluded is fixed by their absence at the coming of the bridegroom.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει αμην λεγω ϋμιν ουκ οιδα ϋμαϲ

**English Translation**
But he answering said, Amen I say to you, I know you not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verdict of the bridegroom is a terrifying negation of relationship. To be without the oil of prudence is to be unrecognized by the master of the feast. The phrase "I know you not" severs the bond completely; despite their lamps and their knocking, they are strangers to the bridegroom because they failed to watch with the necessary provision.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
γρηγορειτε ουν οτι ουκ οιδατε τ ημεραν ουδε την ωραν

**English Translation**
Watch therefore, because you do not know the day nor the hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to watch is absolute, grounded not in what is revealed, but in what remains hidden. Since the day and the hour are veiled from your sight, your vigilance must be perpetual, for ignorance of the timing allows no interval for slumber.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
ωϲπερ γαρ ανθρω αποδημων εκαλεϲεν τουϲ ϊ δουλουϲ και παρεδωκεν αυ> τα ϋπαρχον> αυτου ˙

**English Translation**
For it is just as a man going abroad called his own servants and delivered to them his possessions.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The man going abroad does not abandon his property but transfers the burden of his possessions to his own servants. By calling them his own, he signifies that both the servants and the goods belong solely to him, binding them to stewardship during his absence.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και ω μεν εδωκεν πεντε τα ω δε δυο ˙ ω δε εν · εκαϲτω κατα την ϊδιαν δυναμ και απεδημηϲεν ευθεωϲ ·

**English Translation**
And to one he gave five [talents], and to another two, and to another one; to each according to his own power, and he went abroad immediately.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The distribution is not equal in quantity but equitable in proportion to power. The man’s immediate departure leaves the servants with no further instruction than the capacity he discerned within them, testing their fidelity through the silence of his absence.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
πορευθειϲ δε ο τα πεντε αλαντα ταλαντα λαβων ηργαϲατο ειργαϲατο εν αυτοιϲ και εποι εκερδηϲεν εκερδηϲεν αλλα πεντε ταλαντα

**English Translation**
And having gone, the one having received the five talents talents worked worked with them and made gained gained other five talents.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency of the servant is marked by the immediacy of his labor and the doubling of the fruit. He did not let the talents lie idle, but by working and working again, he transformed the trust received into an abundance equal to the gift.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ωϲαυτωϲ κ(αι) ο τα δυο εκερδηϲ αλλα δυο ·

**English Translation**
Likewise also the one with the two gained other two.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Though the amount received was less, the diligence exercised was identical. He who had two did not despise his portion but mirrored the labor of the first, proving that faithfulness is measured by ratio of gain to gift, not by the sum alone.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ο δε το λαβων απελθων ωρυξεν γην και ε το αργυρι του κυριου αυτου

**English Translation**
But the one having received the [one], having gone away, dug the earth and [hid] the money of his lord.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To dig the earth is to bury the gift in the lower things of this world. By hiding the money of his lord, this servant rendered the silver dead and fruitless, severing the connection between the lord’s possession and the potential for life and increase.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
μετα δε πολυν χρο ερχεται ο κυ των δουλ εκεινων και ϲυναι λογον μετ αυτ

**English Translation**
Now after much time the lord of those servants comes and settles an account with them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The delay is long, testing the endurance of the servants, but the return of the lord is certain. He comes not merely to greet them but to settle the account, demanding a reckoning of how his time and his property were occupied.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων ο τα πεντε λαβων προϲ αλλα πεν ταλαντα λεγων ˙ κυριε πεντε ταλ μοι παρεδωκαϲ ϊδε αλλα πεντε > ταλαντα εκερδηϲα ·

**English Translation**
And having come, the one having received the five [brought] other five talents saying: Lord, five talents you delivered to me; see, other five talents I gained.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant approaches with boldness, holding the fruit of his labor. He acknowledges the source of the capital by saying "you delivered to me," yet he presents the increase as a visible testament to his work, saying "see," for the gain is the proof of his fidelity.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο κυριοϲ αυτου ευ δουλε α και πιϲτε επι ολιγα ηϲ πιϲτοϲ επι πολλων ϲε κα ειϲελθε ειϲ την χαραν του κυριου ϲου

**English Translation**
His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; over a few things you were faithful, over many things I will set you; enter into the joy of your lord.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The lord affirms the servant’s nature as good and faithful. Because the servant proved true over the "few things" of the deposit, he is established over "many things," moving from the burden of labor into the very joy and rest of his lord.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
προϲελθων δε και ο τα δυο ταλαντα λαβ ειπεν δυο ταλαν> μοι παρεδωκαϲ ϊδε αλλα δυο ταλαν εκερδηϲα

**English Translation**
And having come also the one having received the two talents said: Two talents you delivered to me; see, other two talents I gained.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This servant repeats the pattern of the first, showing that the number of talents matters less than the integrity of the return. He presents his two gained talents with the same confidence, for he has fulfilled the capacity of the trust given to him.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο κυριοϲ αυτου ευ δουλε α και πιϲτε επι ολιγα ηϲ πιϲτοϲ > επι πολλων ϲε κα ειϲελθε ειϲ την χαραν του κυριου ϲου

**English Translation**
His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant; over a few things you were faithful, over many things I will set you; enter into the joy of your lord.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The lord pronounces the exact same blessing upon the second as upon the first. The reward of entering the joy of the lord is not graded by the magnitude of the wealth, but is granted fully to all who are found faithful over what was measured out to them.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
προϲελθων δε και ο το εν ταλαντον ει ειπεν εγνων ϲε οτι αν> αυϲτηροϲ ει θεριζων οπου ουκ εϲπειραϲ και > ϲυναγων οθεν ου διεϲκορπιϲαϲ

**English Translation**
And having come also the one having received the one talent said: I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow and gathering from where you did not scatter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant’s inaction is rooted in a distorted knowledge of the man. He accuses the master of being hard and unjust—reaping without sowing—and uses this perception of severity as a pretext for his own sloth, judging his master rather than serving him.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και φοβηθειϲ απελθ εκρυψα το ταλαν ϲου εν τη γη ϊ εχειϲ το ϲον

**English Translation**
And being afraid, having gone away, I hid the talent of yours in the earth; behold, you have the yours.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear paralyzes the soul, causing the servant to bury the gift rather than employ it. He returns the talent untouched, mistakenly believing that safety lies in returning exactly what was received. By saying "you have the yours," he disowns the trust, treating the Master’s property as a foreign burden to be relieved of rather than a seed to be cultivated.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο κυ αυτου ειπεν αυτω πονηρε δου και οκνηρε ηδειϲ οτι θεριζω οπου ουκ εϲπειρα και ϲυ οθεν ου διε

**English Translation**
But answering, the Lord of him said to him: Wicked servant and slothful, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather whence I did not scatter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord judges the servant by the servant's own confession. If the Master is exacting, reaping where he has not sown, then sloth is the most dangerous response. The "wicked" nature is found in the refusal to labor, while the "slothful" heart uses the Master’s severity as an excuse for inactivity rather than a spur to diligence.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
εδει ϲε ουν βαλειν τα αρ το αργυριον μου τοιϲ τρα και ελθ εγω εκομιϲαμην αν το εμον ϲυν το

**English Translation**
It was necessary therefore for you to cast the silver of mine to the bankers, and having come I would have received the mine with the [interest].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The silver belongs to the Lord ("the mine"), and its nature is to increase. Even the minimal effort of casting it to "the bankers" would have sufficed to honor the Master’s property. The failure lies in denying the silver its potential to yield increase, leaving the Master’s claim fruitless when he returns to claim "the mine."

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
αρατε ουν απ αυ το ταλαντον και δοτε τω εχ τα δεκα ταλαν

**English Translation**
Take therefore from him the talent and give to the one having the ten talents.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The talent is not allowed to remain in fruitless hands. It is stripped from the one who buried it and transferred to the one who proved capable of multiplication. Authority over the gift is granted to the one who "has" ten, for stewardship is the prerequisite for continued possession.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
τω γαρ εχοντι παντι δοθηϲεται και περιϲϲευθηϲε του δε μη εχ και ο εχει αρθη απ αυτου

**English Translation**
For to everyone having it shall be given and he shall abound; but from the one not having, even what he has shall be taken from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the divine economy: possession is defined by use. To "have" is to fruitfully employ the grace given; to "not have" is to possess without fruit. The removal of the gift from the slothful is the natural end of his refusal to engage with the abundance offered, resulting in total destitution.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) τον αχριον δουλ εκβαλετε ειϲ το > ϲκοτοϲ το εξωτερ εκει εϲται ο κλαυ> και ο βρυγμοϲ των οδοντων

**English Translation**
And the useless servant cast out into the darkness the outer; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant is deemed "useless" because he produced no increase. His punishment is expulsion from the presence of the Light into "the darkness the outer." The "weeping and the gnashing of the teeth" signify the finality of this separation and the bitter anguish of opportunity eternally lost.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
οταν δε ελθη ο ϋιοϲ του ανθρωπου εν τη δοξη αυτου και παντεϲ οι αγγελοι μετ αυτου τοτε > καθιϲει επι θρονου δοξηϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
But when the Son of Man comes in the glory of him and all the angels with him, then he shall sit upon a throne of glory of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Son of Man appears not in weakness but in the fullness of his glory, attended by the angelic host. He assumes the "throne of glory," marking the transition from the era of mercy to the moment of judgment. The King sits to render the final verdict upon history.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και > ϲυναχθηϲονται εμπροϲθεν αυτου παντα τα εθνη κ(αι) αφοριϲει αφοριεει αυτουϲ απ αλληλων ωϲ> ο ποιμην αφο τα προβατα απο των εριφων

**English Translation**
And shall be gathered before him all the nations, and he shall separate them from one another as the shepherd separates the sheep from the kids.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gathering is universal ("all the nations"), yet the judgment is particular. The separation is as natural and decisive as a shepherd distinguishing species. The "sheep" and the "kids" are revealed for what they are; the judgment merely makes manifest the nature they have formed through their deeds.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και ϲτηϲει τα μ προβατα εκ δεξι τα δε εριφια εξ ευ αυτου

**English Translation**
And he shall stand the sheep on the right, but the kids on the left of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Position reveals destiny. The "right" is the place of honor and acceptance, reserved for the sheep. The "left" is the place of rejection for the kids. The spatial division enacts the eternal spiritual reality of favor versus condemnation.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ερει ο βαϲιλευϲ τοιϲ εκ δεξιων αυ δευτε οι ευλο του π μου κληρονομη την ητοιμα υμιν βα απο κατα κοϲμου

**English Translation**
Then the King shall say to those on the right of him: Come, the blessed of the Father of me, inherit the prepared for you Kingdom from foundation of the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The King invites the righteous to "inherit," implying they are children and heirs. They are "blessed of the Father," and their reward is a Kingdom "prepared" by God's design from the very "foundation of the world." Their salvation was the divine intent before creation began.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
επι γαρ και εδω μοι φαγειν ˙ εδιψηϲα και επο> με ξενοϲ > ημην και ϲυνηγα με

**English Translation**
For since also you gave me to eat; I thirsted and you gave me drink; a stranger I was and you gathered me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The King reveals the cause of their inheritance: acts of mercy. He identifies completely with the needy. To feed the hungry was to feed the King; to gather the stranger was to welcome the Lord. The specific, physical acts of love are the evidence of their blessedness.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
γυμνοϲ και περιεβαλετε με ˙ ηϲθενηϲα κ(αι) επεϲκεψαϲθε με εν φυλακη ημ και ηλθατε προϲ εμε ˙

**English Translation**
Naked and you clothed me; I was weak and you visited me; in prison I was and you came to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The list of mercies concludes with clothing the naked and visiting the sick and imprisoned. The King is found in the lowest places of human suffering ("weak," "in prison"). The righteous are those who did not turn away from such misery but entered into it, and in doing so, they approached the King himself.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
τοτε αποκριθηϲ αυτω οι δικαι λεγοντεϲ πο ϲε ειδομεν πει> και εθρεψα · η διψωντα και εποτιϲαμεν

**English Translation**
Then the righteous shall answer him saying, When did we see thee hungering and nourished, or thirsting and gave drink?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The righteous manifest a holy ignorance of their own virtue. By asking "when," they reveal that their acts of nourishing and giving drink were not calculated for a reward but flowed naturally from their character. They did not perceive the majesty of the one they fed, for true righteousness attends to the need of the hungering without waiting for a vision of glory.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
ποτε δε ϲε ειδο> ξενον και ϲυ · η γυ και περιεβα

**English Translation**
And when did we see thee a stranger and gathered, or naked and clothed?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation continues regarding the stranger and the naked. To gather the stranger is to bring the outsider into the fellowship; to clothe the naked is to cover the shame of the vulnerable. The righteous perceive these deeds only as responses to human necessity, unaware that in gathering the stranger they were offering hospitality to the very center of all authority.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
ποτε δε ϲε ειδομεν αϲθενη η εν φυλακη και ηλθομεν προϲ ϲε

**English Translation**
And when did we see thee weak or in prison and came unto thee?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Weakness and imprisonment mark the lowest estate of man, places of confinement and powerlessness. To come unto such a one is to descend into their affliction. The righteous wonder at the claim that they came unto *him*, for they recall only visiting the weak and the bound, not realizing that the presence they sought was hidden within the suffering they relieved.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο > βαϲιλευϲ ερει αυτοιϲ αμην λεγω ϋμιν εφ οϲον εποιηϲα ενι τουτων τ αδελφων μου τ ελαχιϲτων εμοι εποιηϲατε

**English Translation**
And answering, the King shall say to them, Amen I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it to one of these my brethren the least, ye did it to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The King establishes a perfect union between his person and the least of the brethren. There is no distance between the throne and the wretchedness of the poor; the act performed upon the least is immediately transferred to the King. By calling them brethren, he elevates their status, making the service rendered to them a direct service to his own sovereignty.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ερει και τοιϲ > εξ ευωνυμων ϋ απ εμου > κατηραμενοι > ειϲ το πυρ το αι> το ητοι> τω δι και τοιϲ αγγελοιϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
Then shall he say also to those on the left, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the fire the eternal, which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sentence of separation is absolute: the cursed are commanded to depart from the source of life. They are sent into a fire characterized by eternity, a state not originally intended for humanity but prepared for the devil and his angels. By their choices, the cursed have aligned themselves with the angelic rebellion and thus inherit the doom prepared for that rebellion.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
επιναϲα γαρ και ουκ εδωκατε μοι φαγειν εδιψηϲα και ουκ εποτιϲα με

**English Translation**
For I hungered and ye gave me not to eat; I thirsted and ye gave me not drink.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The indictment rests upon the reality of the King's need which went unmet. He identifies the hunger and thirst as his own personal affliction. The charge is not of active malice but of omission; they possessed the means to alleviate the suffering but refused to give. This refusal to give sustenance is judged as a direct rejection of the person speaking.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
ξενοϲ ημ και ου ϲυνηγαγε με γυμνοϲ κ(αι) ου περιεβαλεται αϲθενηϲ κ(αι) εν φυλακη και > ουκ επεϲκεψαϲθε με

**English Translation**
I was a stranger and ye gathered me not; naked and ye clothed me not; weak and in prison and ye visited me not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The catalogue of neglect exposes the hardness of heart. The stranger was left outside, the naked remained exposed, and the prisoner was abandoned in isolation. The accusation "ye visited me not" implies a duty of oversight and care that was ignored. By failing to gather and clothe, they effectively excluded the King from their midst, leaving him to suffer alone in the guise of the afflicted.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
τοτε αποκριθη> αυτω οι αυτοι κ(αι) αυτοι λεγοντεϲ πο ϲε ειδομεν πι η διψων η ξενον η γυμνον η αϲθενη η εν φυλακη και ουκ ηδιηκο> ϲοι

**English Translation**
Then shall they answer him, they themselves also saying, When did we see thee hungering or thirsting or a stranger or naked or weak or in prison and did not minister to thee?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Their defense is rooted in a lack of recognition. They list the miseries—hunger, thirst, nakedness, prison—but separate them from the person of the Lord. They claim that had they seen *him*, they would have ministered. This reveals that their service is contingent upon the visibility of glory, not the obligation of charity. They demand a sign of dignity before they will stoop to serve, failing to see the dignity inherent in the suffering itself.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
τοτε αποκριθηϲε αυτοιϲ λεγων αμην λεγω ϋμιν εφ οϲον ουκ ε> ενι του των ελαχι> ουδε εμοι εποιηϲατε

**English Translation**
Then shall he answer them saying, Amen I say to you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these the least, neither did ye it to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment is sealed by the same logic of identification. The neglect of the least is the neglect of the King. There is no other criteria for the service of God than the service of the least. The omission of the act towards the visible poor is an omission of duty towards the invisible Sovereign. The failure to do is accounted as a positive act of rejection against the divine person.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
και > απελευϲονται > ουτοι ειϲ κολαϲ αιωνιον οι δε δι ειϲ ζωην > αιωνιον

**English Translation**
And these shall go away into punishment eternal, but the righteous into life eternal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final disposition is irrevocable. The movement is two-fold: one group into punishment, the other into life. Both states are described as eternal, binding the duration of the life to the duration of the punishment. The righteous enter into the life which corresponds to their acts of mercy, while those who failed in charity depart into the punishment which befits their neglect.
