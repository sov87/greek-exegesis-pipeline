**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
εν εκεινη τη ω> προϲηλθον οι μαθηται τω λε τιϲ αρα μει εϲτιν εν τη βαϲιλεια των ου

**English Translation**
In that hour came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inquiry arises in a specific hour, marking a moment where earthly ambition confronts divine order. The disciples approach the Lord not with a plea for mercy, but with a calculation of rank, seeking to measure magnitude within a kingdom that defies measurement. They ask who is greatest, presuming a hierarchy of power, yet they stand before the King who embodies the fullness of the kingdom in His own person.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲαμε παιδιον εϲτη αυτο εν μεϲω αυτων

**English Translation**
And having called a child, he set him in the midst of them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord answers not with a treatise but with a living sign, calling a child from the periphery to the center. By placing the child in the midst of them, He disrupts their circle of status; the one who possesses no legal power or social standing becomes the focal point of divine instruction. This action establishes that the center of the assembly is defined not by the greatest disciple, but by the one whom the Lord has called and positioned.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αμην λεγω ϋμιν εαν μη ϲτραφητε και γενηϲθε ωϲ τα παιδια ου μη ειϲ ειϲελθητε ειϲ την βα των ουρα

**English Translation**
And said, Verily I say to you, if ye turn not and become as the children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Entrance into the kingdom demands a fundamental reversion, a turning back from the complexity of ambition to the simplicity of origin. The Lord does not merely suggest a change of behavior but a change of being, commanding the disciples to become as children. Without this radical transformation—stripping away the pride of age and achievement—the gate of the kingdom remains shut, for one cannot ascend to heaven while weighed down by the desire for earthly greatness.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
οϲτιϲ ουν ταπινωϲει εαυ ωϲ το παιδιον τουτο ουτοϲ εϲτ εϲτ ο μειζων εν τη βα των ουρα

**English Translation**
Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this child, this one is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the paradox of divine magnitude: true height is found only in the depth of humility. The one who lowers himself to the status of the child—who claims no rights and relies entirely on the care of another—is the one whom the kingdom recognizes as great. Self-humiliation is not a loss of dignity but the very method of exaltation in the spiritual order.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ εαν δε παιδιον εν τοιουτο επι τω ο μου εμε δεχεται

**English Translation**
And whoever receives one such child in my name receives me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord establishes an identity between Himself and the lowly. To receive a child in His name is not merely an act of charity but a theological encounter, for the Master is hidden within the least. The reception of the humble is the reception of the Christ, turning every act of hospitality toward the insignificant into direct communion with the King.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
οϲ δ αν ϲκ ενα των > μεικρων τουτ των πιϲτευοντ ειϲ εμε ϲυμφερει αυτω ϊνα κρεμα> μυλοϲ ονικοϲ περι τον τραχηλον αυτου και καταπ εν τω πελαγι τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ

**English Translation**
But whoever offends one of these little ones believing in me, it is profitable for him that a millstone of an ass be hung about his neck and he be drowned in the depth of the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The protection of the faith of the simple is so paramount that the destruction of the physical body is preferable to the guilt of causing a believer to stumble. The image of the heavy millstone and the depth of the sea signifies a judgment of total submersion, removing the offender entirely from the community of the living. It is better to suffer a horrific temporal death than to bear the eternal weight of ruining a soul that believes in Him.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ουαι τω κοϲμω απο των ϲκανδαλων αναγκη γαρ εϲτιν ελθειν τα ϲκανδαλα πλην ουαι τω α δι ου το ϲκανδαλ ερχεται ˙

**English Translation**
Woe to the world because of offenses; for it is necessary that offenses come; but woe to the man through whom the offense comes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world is pitied for the inevitable presence of stumbling blocks, which arise from the conflict between light and darkness. Yet, necessity does not absolve the agent; the inevitability of sin in a fallen world does not excuse the individual who becomes its instrument. The woe pronounced is personal and terrifying, marking the man who serves as the conduit for spiritual ruin.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ει δε η χειρ ϲου η ο πουϲ ϲου ϲκ ϲε εξελε εκκοψ αυ και βαλε απο ϲου καλον ϲοι εϲτιν ειϲ ειϲ την ζω ζω κυλλον η χωλον η δυο χειραϲ η δυο πο εχοντα βληθη ειϲ το πυρ το αι

**English Translation**
And if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off and cast from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life maimed or lame, than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the fire eternal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The integrity of the body must be sacrificed for the integrity of the soul. Hand and foot, instruments of action and path, become enemies if they lead to sin; their amputation represents the violent severance of habits and attachments that endanger salvation. It is a severe mercy to enter life incomplete in flesh rather than to preserve physical wholeness for the sake of eternal burning.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και ει ο ο> ϲου ϲκ ϲε εξελε αυ και βαλε απο > ϲου καλον ϲοι εϲτ μονοφθαλμον ειϲ την ζωην ειϲ η δυο οφθαλ εχοντα βλη ειϲ την γε του πυ>

**English Translation**
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast from thee; it is good for thee one-eyed to enter into life, than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eye, the lamp of the body and the gate of desire, must also be surrendered if it becomes a cause of stumbling. The Lord demands a singular focus on life, even at the cost of vision itself. The alternative is the Gehenna of fire, a destination of total loss where the preservation of the physical senses serves only to heighten the perception of torment.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ορατε μη καταφρο ενοϲ τ μεικρων τουτ λεγω γαρ υμιν ο οι αγγελοι αυτ εν ουρανοιϲ δια παντοϲ βλεπουϲι το προϲωπον του πατροϲ μου του εν ουρανοιϲ

**English Translation**
See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, that their angels in heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Contempt for the little ones is forbidden because their dignity is anchored in the celestial court. Their angels, standing in the immediate presence of the Father, possess the beatific vision; thus, the lowliest believer on earth is represented before the highest throne. To despise the little one is to insult one whose guardian gazes eternally upon the face of God.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
τι υμιν δοκει εαν γε τινι εκατον προβατα και πλανηθη εξ αυτων ουχι α τα ενενηκ εννεα επι τα ορη πορευ ζητι το πλα

**English Translation**
What think ye? If there be to any man a hundred sheep, and one of them go astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains, and going seek that which strays?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine economy values the one lost soul with an intensity that compels the shepherd to leave the safety of the many. The ninety-nine on the mountains represent the established and the secure, yet the shepherd’s heart is moved by the single wanderer. The search is active and laborious, driven by a love that cannot rest while a portion of the flock remains in peril.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και ε γενηται ευριν ευρ αυτο αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι χαιρι επ αυτω μαλλον η επι τοιϲ ενενηκοντα εν τοιϲ μη πε

**English Translation**
And if it happen that he find it, verily I say to you, that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The joy of recovery surpasses the contentment of possession. While the ninety-nine are safe, the restoration of the one who was lost provokes a singular celebration, revealing the mercy of God which delights in the return of the sinner. This rejoicing confirms that the kingdom is built not merely on justice for the righteous, but on the triumphant recovery of the fallen.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ ουκ εϲτιν θελημα του ϋ του εν ουρα ϊνα απολη εν των μικρ τουτων

**English Translation**
Thus it is not the will of the Son in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine volition is singular in its intent for preservation. The Son in heaven holds a will that specifically encompasses the safety of the smallest members of the flock, ensuring that not even one constitutes a loss to the heavenly order.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε αμαρτηϲη ὁ αδελφοϲ ϲου ϋ ελεγξον αυ μεταξυ ϲου κ(αι) αυτου μονου ε ϲου ακουϲη εκερ τον αδελ ϲου

**English Translation**
But if your brother sins, reprove him between you and him alone; if he hears you, you have gained your brother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Correction is an act of restoration, not public humiliation. The command dictates that the initial movement toward the erring brother must be shrouded in privacy, allowing the relationship to be mended without the stain of open scandal.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε μη ακουϲη παρα μετα ϲεαυτου ετι ενα η δυο ϊνα επι ϲτοματοϲ δυ η τριων μαρτυ ϲταθη παν ρημα

**English Translation**
But if he does not hear, take with yourself yet one or two, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may stand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Truth requires the stability of corroboration. When private admonition fails, the circle widens not to shame, but to establish the certainty of the matter through the requisite number of witnesses, ensuring the judgment rests on solid testimony.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε πα αυτων ειπον τη εκκλη εαν δε και τηϲ εκκληϲιαϲ παρα εϲτω ϲοι ωϲπερ ο εθνικοϲ και ο τελωνηϲ

**English Translation**
And if he refuses to hear them, speak to the church; but if he also refuses to hear the church, let him be to you just as the gentile and the tax collector.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ultimate tribunal is the gathered assembly of the faithful. Persistent refusal to heed the voice of the church results in a separation of communion, placing the obstinate one outside the covenant boundaries, akin to those who live without the law.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμ οϲ οϲα εαν δηϲητε ε τηϲ γηϲ εϲται δεδεμενα εν δεδεμενο̣ν̣ ε̣ν̣ τοιϲ ουρανοιϲ κ(αι) και οϲα αν εαν εαν λυϲηται ε τηϲ γηϲ εϲται λελυμενα εν ου

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, whatever things you bind on the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatever things you loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgments rendered by the church on earth possess a terrifying reality in the celestial realm. The authority to bind and loose is not a mere administrative function but a mirror of divine ratification, linking terrestrial discipline with heavenly consequence.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
παλιν λεγω ϋμιν οτι εαν δυο ϲυμ ε ϋμων επι τηϲ γηϲ περι παντοϲ πραγματοϲ ου ε αιτηϲωνται αυ γενηϲεται παρα του μου του εν ο ·

**English Translation**
Again I say to you that if two of you agree on the earth concerning every matter of which they ask, it shall be done for them by my [Father] in [heaven].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is a profound power in the concord of the faithful. When even a small number unify their will on earth, this harmony compels action from the divine source, demonstrating that spiritual unity is the prerequisite for answered petition.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ου οπου ὁυ γαρ ειϲιν δυο η · · ϲυ ειϲ το εμον ονομα εκει ειμι εν με αυτων

**English Translation**
For where there are two or [three] gathered into my name, there am I in the midst of them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of the Lord is located within the assembly gathered for his sake. It is not the location but the Name which constitutes the sanctuary, drawing the divine presence into the very center of the community.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲελθ αυτω ο πετροϲ ειπεν ποϲακιϲ αμαρτη ειϲ εμε ο αδελ μου και αφη αυτω εωϲ επτα

**English Translation**
Then Peter approaching him said, How often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? Until seven times?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter seeks to quantify the obligation of mercy, suggesting a limit that appears generous to human reasoning. He attempts to place a boundary upon charity, defining the endpoint of forgiveness by a specific count.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτω ο ου λεγω ϲοι εωϲ ε αλλ εωϲ εβδομηκοντακιϲ επτα

**English Translation**
He says to him: I do not say to you until seven, but until seventy times seven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord shatters the boundaries of calculated mercy. Forgiveness is removed from the realm of arithmetic and placed into the realm of the infinite, requiring a patience that multiplies beyond any reasonable accounting.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
δια τουτο ωμοιω η βαϲιλια των ο α βαϲι οϲ ηθεληϲεν ϲυναραι λογον με των δουλων αυτου

**English Translation**
Therefore the kingdom of heaven was likened to a man, a king, who wished to settle an account with his slaves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heavenly kingdom operates under the strict sovereignty of a monarch who demands a reckoning. The relationship between the creator and the creature involves a serious accounting of debts owed to the supreme authority.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
αρξαμενου δε αυτου ϲυναιρ ϲυναιρ προϲηνεχθη ειϲ αυτω αυτω ειϲ οφιλετηϲ πολλων μυριων ταλαντ

**English Translation**
And when he began to settle, there was brought to him one debtor of many ten-thousand talents.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The magnitude of the debt presented is overwhelming, signifying a burden impossible for the servant to bear. This illustrates the infinite nature of the obligation that stands against the subject before the king.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
μη εχοντοϲ δε αυτου αποδουνε εκελευϲεν αυτ αυτ ο πραθηνε πραθηναι και την γυνεκα γυναικα και τα πεδια και παντα ο ειχεν και απο

**English Translation**
But as he had not [means] to pay, the lord commanded him to be sold, and the wife, and the children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Insolvency before the king results in total forfeiture. The justice of the master claims the very person of the debtor and all his house, showing that the debt involves the entirety of one's life and freedom.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
πεϲων ουν ο δουλοϲ εκινοϲ προϲ αυτω λεγ μακροθυμηϲ επ εμοι και παντα αποδωϲω ϲοι ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Falling therefore that servant [before] him says: Have patience on me, and all I will pay to thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant adopts the posture of abject humility, falling before he speaks, acknowledging the vast disparity between his station and the authority he faces. His plea is not for the cancellation of the debt, for he does not yet understand the nature of grace, but for time (`μακροθυμηϲ`), acting under the delusion that human effort can eventually settle an infinite deficit. He promises a repayment that is impossible, seeking to bind the master to a contract of patience rather than surrendering to the necessity of mercy.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ϲπλαγχνιϲθιϲ δε ο του δουλου ε απελυϲεν αυτον και το δανι αφηκεν αυτω ·

**English Translation**
And being moved with compassion the [lord] of that servant released him, and the loan he forgave him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The master responds not to the logic of the servant's promise, but to the misery of his condition. The movement of compassion (`ϲπλαγχνιϲθιϲ`) precedes the legal act; judgment is suspended by love. The release is total: the servant is freed from physical custody (`απελυϲεν`) and the crushing weight of the loan is utterly sent away (`αφηκεν`), demonstrating that divine forgiveness clears both the person and the account without demanding collateral.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
εξελθων δε ο δου εκινοϲ ευρεν ενα των ϲυνδου αυτου οϲ ω αυτω εκατ εκατ δηναρια και κρατη αυτον επνιγ επνιγ λεγων αποδοϲ ει τι οφιλιϲ

**English Translation**
But going out that servant found one of his fellow-servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and seizing him he choked [him], saying: Pay if anything thou owest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He goes out from the presence of grace and immediately enacts the tyranny of the law upon his equal. The violence is visceral; he seizes and chokes (`επνιγ`) the debtor, enforcing a physical claim over a trivial sum compared to what he was just remitted. By demanding "pay if anything thou owest," he reinstates the strict accounting he had just begged to escape, proving his heart was untouched by the charity he received.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
πεϲων ουν ο ϲυνδουλοϲ αυτου παρεκαλι αυτον λεγων μακροθυμηϲον επ εμοι και παντα απο ϲοι

**English Translation**
Falling therefore his fellow-servant besought him, saying: Have patience on me, and all I will [pay] to thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The fellow-servant mirrors the first servant’s earlier action exactly, falling and using the precise words of the previous plea. This creates a moment of judgment for the first servant, who sees his own desperation reflected in his brother. The repetition of the prayer for patience (`μακροθυμηϲον`) serves as a test: will he recognize the voice of his own need in the mouth of another, or has the relief of his own danger erased the memory of his frailty?

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ου ηθελεν και αλλα α εβαλεν αυτον ειϲ φυλακ εωϲ αποδη αποδω το ο

**English Translation**
But he would not; but he cast him into prison until he should pay that which [was owed].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text locates the sin in the will: "he would not" (`ου ηθελεν`). He had the power to forgive, derived from the forgiveness he possessed, but he chose the way of coercion. By casting his brother into prison, he ensures the debt cannot be paid, as a prisoner earns no wages. He prefers the destruction of his brother's freedom to the relinquishing of his own petty claim, locking his fellow-servant in the darkness to satisfy his greed.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ϊδ ϊδ ουν δε ουν οι ϲυνδου αυτου τα γενο γεινομενα γενομενα ελυπηθη ϲφοδρα οι δε ελθοντεϲ διεϲα τω εαυ παντα τα γε

**English Translation**
Seeing therefore his fellow-servants the things happening, they were grieved exceedingly; and coming they reported to their own [lord] all the things done.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The community of servants, witnessing this violation of mercy, is struck with great grief (`ελυπηθη`). They perceive that the grace shown to one should have flowed to all; its arrest causes scandal. They do not take vengeance themselves but report the "things done" to the one Authority who established the law of the house, testifying that the order of forgiveness has been inverted by the ungrateful recipient.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲκαλεϲα αυτον ο αυτου λεγι αυτω δουλε πονηρε πα την οφιλην εκινην αφηκα ϲοι επι παρεκαλεϲαϲ με

**English Translation**
Then calling him, his [lord] says to him: Wicked servant, all that debt I forgave thee, since thou besoughtest me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant is now defined by his wickedness (`πονηρε`), which consists of receiving charity without reciprocating it. The master reminds him that the forgiveness was a response to a plea ("since thou besoughtest me"). The cancellation of the debt was not a right but a gift contingent upon the relationship established by prayer; by acting as a tyrant to his fellow, the servant retroactively invalidates the spirit of the grace he was given.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
ουκ εδει και ϲε ελεηϲε τον ϲυν ϲου ωϲ καγω ϲε ηλεηϲα

**English Translation**
Did it not behoove thee also to have pity on thy fellow-servant, as I also had pity on thee?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The moral force of the gospel is captured in the word "behoove" or "was necessary" (`εδει`). Mercy is not optional for the redeemed; it is an obligation binding upon those who have been spared. The master sets his own action ("as I") as the absolute archetype for the servant’s conduct. To accept the master's pity while refusing one's own to a brother is a contradiction the kingdom cannot sustain.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και οργιϲθιϲ ο ωᵨ αυτου παρεδω αυτον τοιϲ βαϲανιϲταιϲ εω εωϲ ου αποδω παν το ὁφιλομεν ὁφιλομεν αυτω αυτω ˙

**English Translation**
And being angry his [lord] delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was owed to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The master's anger results in a delivery not merely to confinement, but to "tormentors" (`βαϲανιϲταιϲ`). The revocation of mercy leaves the servant to face the full, unmitigated reality of his debt. The condition "until he pay all" suggests a punishment without end, for he has no means in the hands of tormentors to generate the infinite sum required for his release. He who refused to forgive a temporal debt is consumed by an eternal one.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ και ο μου ο ουρα ποιηϲι ϋμ ϋμ εαν μη αφητε εκαϲτοϲ τω αδελ αυτου απο τ καρδιων ϋμων

**English Translation**
So also my [Father] the heavenly will do to you, if ye forgive not each his brother from your hearts.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The similitude is closed with a direct warning to the faithful. The heavenly Father's dealing with us is inextricably linked to our dealing with our brethren. The requirement is deep and searching: forgiveness must not be superficial or verbal, but "from the hearts" (`απο των καρδιων`). If the heart retains malice, the entire person remains subject to the judgment, for God will not acquit the one who holds a brother guilty.
