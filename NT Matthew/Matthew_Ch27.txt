**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
πρωϊαϲ δε γενο ϲυμβου ελαβον π οι αρχϊεριϲ και οι πρεϲβυτεροι του λαου κατα του ωϲτε θανατω αυτον

**English Translation**
And morning having come, counsel took [all] the chief priests and the elders of the people against him, so as to kill him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The darkness of the night’s conspiracy matures into the resolve of the morning. The leaders of the people, entrusted with the guidance of the nation, unify their counsel not for preservation but for destruction. They seek the death of the one who is Life, turning their authority against its very source.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και δη αυτον α και πα πιλατω τω ηγεμονι

**English Translation**
And binding him, [they led away] and [delivered] to Pilate the governor.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They bind the one who releases captives, attempting to constrain divine power with human cords. By delivering him to the governor, they transfer the burden of judgment to the Gentile authority, yet the act of handing him over implicates them in the very sentence they seek.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ϊδων ϊουδαϲ ο παραδιδουϲ αυ οτι κατεκρι μετεμεληθη μεταμεληθιϲ και εϲτρεψεν εϲτρεψεν απεϲτρεψεν τα · αργυρια τοιϲ αρ και πρε

**English Translation**
Then seeing, Judas the [one] betraying him, that he was condemned, having regretted [regretting], and turned [turned] returned the silver pieces to the chief [priests] and elders.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The traitor witnesses the fruit of his deed—condemnation—and is seized by a fruitless sorrow. The manifold repetition of his turning back the silver betrays the turmoil of a soul seeking to undo an irreversible transaction. He returns the price, but he cannot return the person.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
λεγ ημαρτον παραδουϲ αιμα αθωον οι δε ειπον τι προϲ ημαϲ ϲυ οψη

**English Translation**
Saying, I sinned having betrayed innocent blood. But they said, What [is that] to us? You shall see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A confession of sin and a proclamation of innocence ring out in the temple, yet they fall on stony ground. The conspirators acknowledge no shared guilt in the shedding of innocent blood, isolating the betrayer with his burden. They cast the weight of the deed solely upon the one who served their purpose.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και ριψαϲ τα αργυρι ειϲ τον ναον α και απελθων απηγ

**English Translation**
And having thrown the silver pieces into the temple, [he withdrew] and having gone away, hanged himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The wages of iniquity are cast into the sanctuary, polluting the holy place with the price of a life. The betrayer separates himself from the fellowship of the living, finding no place for repentance but only the finality of despair in his self-destruction.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
οι δε αρχϊερειϲ λα τα αργυρι ειπον ουκ εξεϲτ βαλιν αυτα ειϲ τ κορβαναν επι τι αιματοϲ εϲτ

**English Translation**
But the chief priests [taking] the silver pieces said, It is not lawful to cast them into the treasury, since price of blood it is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They scruple over the ritual purity of the treasury while trafficking in the destruction of the innocent. They rightly identify the silver as the price of blood, condemning their own purchase even as they seek to maintain the law's outward form.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ϲυμβουλιον δε λα ηγοραϲαν εξ αυτων τον αγρ του κεραμεωϲ ειϲ ταφην τοιϲ ξενοιϲ

**English Translation**
And counsel [having taken], they bought from them the field of the potter for burial for the strangers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The coin given for the Holy One is used to purchase a resting place for those who are strangers to the land. In this exchange, the rejection of the one brings a place of repose for the outcasts, prefiguring a grace that extends to those outside the covenant.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
διο εκληθη ο αγροϲ εκινοϲ αγροϲ αι εωϲ τηϲ ϲη

**English Translation**
Wherefore was called that field, Field of Blood, until [today].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The land itself bears the name of the crime, serving as a perpetual witness to the cost of its acquisition. The title "Field of Blood" endures, marking the earth with the memory of the betrayal and the specific value placed upon the life of the condemned.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε επληρωθη το ρηθεν δια ϊερεμι του προφητου > λεγοντοϲ και > ελα τα · · αργυρια τ > τιμην του > τετιμη ον > ετιμη απο ϋϊων >

**English Translation**
And then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet saying, And [they took] the [thirty] silver pieces, the price of the [one] valued, whom [they valued] from sons...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ancient lamentation finds its completion in this transaction. The specific valuation—thirty pieces—is not an accident of history but a fulfillment of the prophetic word. The sons of the people set a price upon the priceless, reducing the infinite worth of the Just One to a countable sum.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και εδωκα > αυ ειϲ τον αγρον του > κεραμεωϲ καθα > ϲυνεταξεν μοι

**English Translation**
And I gave them for the field of the potter, just as [he] appointed me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disposition of the blood money follows a divine appointment, even through the agency of the unjust. The prophetic "I gave" aligns the historical act of the priests with the sovereign script of God, who orchestrates even the betrayal into a vessel of His purpose.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε εϲταθη εμ του ηγε και επηρω αυτον ο ο ηγε λεγων ϲυ ει ο βαϲιλευϲ των ϊου ο δε εφη ϲυ λεγιϲ

**English Translation**
Now he stood before the governor; and the governor asked him saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he said, You say.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He stands in silence before the earthly power, affirming his kingship only through the words of the interrogator. He does not claim the title for himself in a manner that seeks earthly rivalry, but allows the truth to be spoken by the Gentile, acknowledging the reality without accepting the political definition.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και εν τω κατηγο αυτον ϋπο των αρχϊερεων και πρεϲβυτερ ουδεν απεκρινα

**English Translation**
And in his being accused by the chief priests and elders, nothing he answered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Against the torrent of accusations, the Word offers no verbal defense. His silence is not an admission of guilt but a demonstration of a higher authority that refuses to engage with falsehood. He endures the contradiction of sinners without returning reviling for reviling.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγι αυτω ο πιλατοϲ ουκ ακου ποϲα ϲου κατα

**English Translation**
Then Pilate says to him, Do you not hear how many things [are] against you?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The governor appeals to the hearing of the ear, listing the quantity of accusations rather than their quality. The text presents the charges simply as "things against," suggesting the vagueness of the world's hostility when confronted with the Truth.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ απεκριθη αυ προϲ ουδε εν ρη ωϲτε θαυμαζ τον ηγεμονα λι λι

**English Translation**
And he answered him not to even one word, so that the governor marveled very much.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Silence becomes a sovereign act; by refusing to engage with even a single "word" (*rēma*), the accused exerts a power that forces the ruler to marvel greatly (*li li*). The stillness of the just man confounds the authority of the state.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
κατα δε εορτην ει ο ηγεμων απολυειν ενα τω οχλω δεϲμιον παρητουντο ηθελον

**English Translation**
Now at the feast the governor [was accustomed] to release one prisoner to the crowd [whom] they requested [and] wished.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mechanism of mercy is corrupted into a tool of popularity; the text emphasizes that the release is governed by what the crowd requests and wishes, placing the power of life and death in the hands of fluctuating desire.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ειχ ειχ δε τον τε τοτε δεϲμιον επιϲημον λεγο βαραββαν

**English Translation**
And they had, they had at that time a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition (*eich eich*) underscores the crowd's possession of this specific sinner; Barabbas is "notorious," marked out by name, standing as the precise embodiment of the guilt the world prefers to hold onto.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ϲυνηγμενων ουν αυτων ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο ο πιλατοϲ τινα θε απολυϲω υμ βαραββαν · η τον λεγομενον

**English Translation**
Therefore when they were gathered, Pilate said to them, Whom do you wish I release to you? Barabbas, or the [one] called?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate places the notorious name against the one merely designated as "the called." The gathering of the people serves only to present them with a binary choice between the known agent of violence and the undefined figure of mystery.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
η γαρ οτι δια φθον παρεδωκαν αυτ

**English Translation**
For he knew that because of envy they delivered him up.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The root of the judicial crisis is identified not as justice, but as envy (*phthonon*). The judge's knowledge of this malice renders his subsequent actions inexcusable, as he discerns the innocence of the delivered one yet proceeds.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
καθημενου δε αυ επι του βηματοϲ απεϲτιλεν προϲ αυ η γυνη αυτου λεγουϲα μηδεν ϲοι και τω δικαιω εκι πολλα γαρ επα ϲημερον κατ ο δι αυτον

**English Translation**
And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that righteous man; for I suffered many things today in a dream because of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine testimony enters the judgment seat (*bēma*) through the suffering of a woman in a dream. The accused is vindicated by the title "righteous man," establishing his innocence even as the earthly court moves toward his condemnation.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
οι δε αρχϊεριϲ και οι πρεϲβυτεροι επιϲ τουϲ οχλουϲ ϊνα αι τον βα τον δε α

**English Translation**
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy the [other].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Religious authority is inverted, used to persuade the multitude toward death rather than life. The objective is twofold: the preservation of Barabbas and the specific destruction of the other, showing the total exchange of guilt for innocence.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο η ειπεν αυ τινα θελετε απο των · · απολυ ϋμιν οι δε ειπ τον βαραββαν

**English Translation**
And the governor answering said to them, Whom do you wish of the [two] I release to you? And they said, Barabbas.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The governor offers a division "of the [two]," attempting to rely on the people's will. Their response is immediate and singular: they name Barabbas, rejecting the unnamed alternative and aligning themselves with the notorious prisoner.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτοιϲ ο πιλα τι ουν ποιηϲω τον λεγομενον λεγουϲιν παν ϲταυρωθητω

**English Translation**
Pilate says to them, What then shall I do [with] the [one] called? They all say, Let him be crucified.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Faced with "the called" one, the crowd's will unifies into a command for execution. The phrase "let him be crucified" marks the transition from rejection to active destruction, as the entirety (*pantes*) demands the cross.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εφη τι γαρ κακ εποιηϲεν οι δε περιϲϲω περιϲϲωϲ εκρα λεγοντεϲ ϲταυ

**English Translation**
And he said, For what evil did he do? But they cried out exceedingly, exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Rational inquiry into "what evil" is drowned out by the volume of hatred. The repetition of "exceedingly" (*perissōs*) signifies a madness that transcends law, where the shout for crucifixion serves as its own justification.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε ο πιλατοϲ οτι ουδεν ωφελι αλλα μαλλον θορυ γεινεται λαβ λαβ ϋδωρ απενιψατο ταϲ χιραϲ απεναν του οχλου λεγων · αθωοϲ ειμι απο του αιματοϲ του δικαιου τουτου υμειϲ δε ο

**English Translation**
And Pilate, seeing that it profits nothing, but rather a tumult is arising, taking water, washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; and you [see to it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judge abdicates his duty in the face of a tumult, using water to cleanse a moral stain. He confesses the accused as "this righteous man" yet abandons him, attempting to shift the weight of the blood entirely onto the beholders.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθιϲ παϲ ο λαοϲ ειπεν το αιμα αυτου εφ ημαϲ και επι τα τεκνα ημων ·

**English Translation**
And answering, all the people said, His blood [be] upon us and upon our children.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The collective voice of "all the people" accepts a burden of terrifying weight. By invoking "his blood" upon themselves and their "children," they establish a self-imposed covenant of judgment, binding the consequences of this death to their own lineage.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
τοτε απελυϲεν αυτοιϲ τον βαραββαν τον δε φραγελλωϲαϲ παρεδωκεν αυτοιϲ ϊνα ϲταυ

**English Translation**
Then he released Barabbas to them, but having scourged [him], he delivered [him] to them in order that [he be] cru[cified].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The release of "Barabbas" stands in stark opposition to the fate of the one "scourged." The governor delivers the victim "to them," effectively transferring the physical execution to the will of the petitioners, for the specific purpose that he be "cru[cified]."

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
τοτε οι ϲτρατιωται του ηγεμονοϲ πα τον ειϲ το πραιτωριον ϲυνηγαγον επ αυτ ολην την ϲπιραν

**English Translation**
Then the soldiers of the governor, [taking] him into the praetorium, gathered together upon him the whole cohort.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The location shifts to the "praetorium," the seat of authority, where the "soldiers of the governor" act as agents of the state. The gathering of the "whole cohort" "upon him" signifies the overwhelming force of the world arrayed against a single captive.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και εκδυϲαντεϲ ενδυϲαντεϲ εκδυϲαντεϲ αυ · χλαμυδα κοκ περιεθηκ αυτω ˙

**English Translation**
And stripping, clothing, stripping him, a scarlet chlamys they placed around him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text describes a chaotic sequence of "stripping, clothing, stripping," reflecting the unstable and violent mockery of the soldiers. They ultimately place a "scarlet chlamys" around him, using the raiment of command to degrade rather than honor.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και πλεξαν ϲτεφανον εξ α επεθη επι τηϲ κεφα αυτου · και κα εν τη δεξι αυτου · και γονυ εμ αυτου ενε αυτω λεγον χαιρε ο βαϲιλευϲ των ϊουδαιων

**English Translation**
And plaiting a crown out of [thorns], they put [it] upon his head, and a [reed] in his right [hand]; and kneeling [before] him, they [mocked] him, saying, Hail, the King of the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Every symbol of royalty is inverted: the "crown" is woven from "thorns," and the scepter is a mere "[reed]" in his "right [hand]." Their verbal confession, "Hail, the King of the Jews," speaks a truth they intend only as scorn, delivered while "kneeling" in false adoration.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και εμπτυϲαντεϲ ειϲ αυ ελαβον τον κα και ετυπτ ειϲ την κεφαλην αυτου

**English Translation**
And spitting into him, they took the [reed] and struck into his head.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mockery turns to physical assault; the homage of the previous verse becomes "spitting into him." They use the emblem of his mock sovereignty, the "[reed]," to inflict pain directly "into his head," combining insult with injury.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
και οτε ενεπε αυτω · εκδυϲ αυτον την χλα ενεδυϲαν αυτον τα ϊματια αυ και απηγαγον αυτον ειϲ το ϲταυ

**English Translation**
And when they [had mocked] him, they [stripped] him of the [chlamys], put his garments on him, and led him away in order to [crucify].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "chlamys" is removed, and "his garments" are restored, marking the end of the theatrical torture. The procession now has a singular, final destination: they lead him away "to [crucify]," moving from the praetorium to the place of execution.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
εξερχομενοι δε ευ κυρηνε ονοματι ϲιμω τουτον ηγγαρευ ϊνα αρη τον ϲταυ αυτου

**English Translation**
And coming out they [found] a Cyrenian, by name Simon; this one they impressed that he might bear his [cross].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Upon leaving the city, the burden is transferred to a stranger, "Simon," identified as a "Cyrenian." The soldiers "impressed" him into service, compelling participation in the suffering by forcing him to "bear his [cross]."

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντεϲ ειϲ το λεγομενον γολγοθα ο εϲ κρανιου τοποϲ λεγομενοϲ λεγομενοϲ

**English Translation**
And coming into the [place] called Golgotha, which is Place of a Skull called called.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They arrive at the specific location "called Golgotha." The text defines this site vividly as "Place of a Skull," and the repetition "called called" emphasizes the notoriety and the specific designation of this ground of death.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
εδω αυτω πιν πιειν οιν μετα χοληϲ μεμιγ και γευϲα ουκ ηθελη ηθελεν ηθεληϲεν πιν πιειν πιειν

**English Translation**
They gave him to drink to drink wine mingled with gall; and tasting, he would not would not would not to drink to drink to drink.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters with the intensity of the refusal. Offered "wine mingled with gall," he tastes but rejects the stupefying mixture. The threefold repetition "would not would not would not" underscores the absolute resolution of his will to face the passion without dimming his senses.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ϲταυρωϲ δε αυτον διεμε τα ιματια αυ βαλοντεϲ κλη

**English Translation**
And [having crucified] him, they [divided] his garments, casting a [lot].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act of execution is stated simply as "[having crucified] him." Attention immediately shifts to the spoils, where "his garments" are "divided" not by right or order, but by the chance of "casting a [lot]," stripping the victim of his last earthly possession.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και καθημενοι ετηρουν αυτον ε

**English Translation**
And sitting down, they watched him [there].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The soldiers assume a posture of waiting, "sitting down." Their duty is now passive vigilance as they "watched him [there]," ensuring the sentence is carried to its fatal conclusion.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και επεθηκαν επα τηϲ κεφαληϲ αυ την αιτιαν αυ γεγραμμενην ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο βα των ϊουδε

**English Translation**
And they put up over his head his accusation written: This is the king of the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusation placed above the head serves not as a charge of crime but as a proclamation of identity. Written for all to see, the title declares him King of the Jews, confirming the very sovereignty intended to be mocked. The placement over the head signifies that this authority crowns him even in the humiliation of the cross.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ϲταυρουνται ϲυ ϲ αυτω δυο ληϲτε ληϲται ειϲ εκ δεξιων και ειϲ εξ ευωνυμ

**English Translation**
Then are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right and one on the left.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He is numbered among transgressors, crucified between two robbers as if he were their captain in crime. Yet, being placed between one on the right and one on the left reveals a center of judgment and mercy even on the cross. The arrangement mimics a royal court, though the attendants are thieves.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
οι δε παραπορευο εβλαϲφη αυτον κινο ταϲ κεφαλαϲ αυ

**English Translation**
And those passing by blasphemed him, shaking their heads,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The physical motion of shaking heads accompanies the verbal assault of blasphemy. Those passing by do not stop to understand but move in derision, using their bodies to deny the authority resting above his own head. This movement signifies a rejection of the wisdom of God manifest in suffering.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και λεγοντεϲ ο καταλυων τον να και εν τριϲιν η οικοδομ ϲωϲον ϲεαυτον ˙ ει υϊοϲ ει του και καταβηθι απο του ϲταυρου

**English Translation**
and saying: The [one] destroying the temple and in three days building [it], save yourself; if you are Son of the [God], and come down from the cross.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mockery targets his power to rebuild and his identity as Son. They demand he come down to prove his sonship, unaware that staying on the cross is the ultimate proof of his obedience. The demand to save oneself contradicts his divine mission to save the world through the destruction of his own bodily temple.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
ομοι οι αρχϊεριϲ εμ μετα των πρεϲβυτερ και γραμμαται ελεγον

**English Translation**
Likewise the chief priests mocking with the elders and scribes said:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The religious leaders join the chorus of scorn. Chief priests, elders, and scribes, who should discern the signs, instead unite in mockery. Their agreement in ridicule marks their blindness to the fulfillment of the very scriptures the scribes study and the priests serve.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
αλλουϲ ε εαυτον ου δυναται ϲωϲαι · βα ι εϲτιν · καταβατω νυν α του ϲταυρου και πιϲτευϲωμ επ αυτον ·

**English Translation**
Others he saved, himself he cannot save; King of Israel he is; let him come down now from the cross and we will believe upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They speak a profound truth in their taunt: he cannot save himself precisely because he wills to save others. Their declaration, "King of Israel he is," stands as an unwitting confession of his true dignity. They demand a descent from the cross as a condition for belief, failing to see that his remaining upon it is the foundation of faith.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
πεποι επι τον · ρυϲαϲθω νυν · ει θελι αυτον ˙ ειπ γαρ οτι θεου ειμι

**English Translation**
He has trusted on the [God]; let him deliver [him] now if he wants him; for he said that: I am of God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They mock his trust in the [God], implying that suffering is evidence of divine rejection. They quote his own claim, "I am of God," using his relationship with the Father as the weapon of their scorn. They demand immediate deliverance as the only proof of divine favor, ignoring the mystery of patience.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
το δʼ αυτο και οι λη οι ϲυνϲταυ ϲυν αυτω ωνειδιζ αυτον

**English Translation**
And the same also the robbers who were crucified with him reproached him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reproach is universal, extending even to the robbers dying beside him. Suffering does not automatically bring wisdom; these men, sharing his physical agony, join the world in rejecting his spiritual authority. The rejection is total, from the highest priests to the lowest criminals.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
απο δε εκτηϲ ω ϲκοτοϲ εγενε εφ ολην την γην εωϲ ωραϲ ενα

**English Translation**
And from the sixth hour darkness came upon the whole earth until the ninth hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The creation responds to the Creator's plight where men do not. Darkness covers the earth, signaling a cosmic mourning and a suspension of the natural order. The light of the world is suffering, and the sun veils its face, testifying against the blindness of those who mock below.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
περι δε την ε ωραν ανε ο φω μεγαλη λεγ ελωϊ ελωϊ λεμα ϲαβαχθανει του εϲτιν μου μου · ϊνατι με εγ

**English Translation**
And about the ninth hour [he] cried out with a loud voice saying: Eloi Eloi lema sabachthanei? That is: My [God], my [God], why me [forsook]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cry in the loud voice reveals the depth of the agony. Using the words "Eloi Eloi," he expresses the reality of abandonment felt in the flesh. "Why" marks the mystery of this separation, where the Son experiences the distance of sin without sinning. The repetition "My [God]" clings to relation even in desolation.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
τινεϲ δε των εκει εϲτηκοτων ακου ελεγον η φωνι ουτοϲ ·

**English Translation**
And some of those standing there hearing said: [Elijah] this one calls.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Misunderstanding the cry, they confuse the call to God for a summons of Elijah. This error exposes their superstition and lack of spiritual discernment. They listen but do not hear, substituting a prophet for the Father.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
και ευθεωϲ δραμ ειϲ · και λαβων ϲπογ πληϲαϲ τε ο και περιθειϲ καλαμω . εποτιζ εποτιζ αυτον

**English Translation**
And immediately one running; and taking a sponge, filling [it] of [vinegar] and putting [it] around a reed, gave him to drink.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The immediate physical response involves running and a sponge filled with sour wine. The bitter drink offered on a reed fulfills the bitterness of the suffering. Even in this act, whether of mercy or mockery, the scripture is accomplished through the vinegar and the reed.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
οι δε λοιποι ελεγ ελεγ αφεϲ ϊδωμεν ει ερχεται ηλιαϲ ϲω ϲωϲων αυτον αλλοϲ δε λαβων λογχ λογχ ενυξεν αυτου τ πλευραν και εξηλ ϋδωρ και αι

**English Translation**
But the rest said, 'Let be, let us see if Elias comes saving him.' But another, taking a spear, pierced his side, and there came out water and blood.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the mystery revealed in the flesh even before the spirit departs. While the crowd mocks, waiting for Elias, the soldier’s iron opens the fountain of life. From the living temple of His body, the water of cleansing and the blood of redemption flow forth immediately under the stroke, testifying that the Fount of Life pours itself out voluntarily while He yet breathes.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
ο δε παλιν κρα φωνη μεγα αφηκεν το ·

**English Translation**
But he, again crying out with a great voice, yielded up the [spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The order of the sacrifice is preserved: after the blood is shed, the voice remains to declare victory. He does not fade in silence as one conquered by the spear, but cries out with a great voice, showing that death does not seize Him by force; rather, He authoritatively releases that which is His to give.

**Verse 51**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου το κατα του να εϲχιϲθη ειϲ δυο ανωθεν εωϲ κατω · και η γη εϲι εϲιϲ και αι πετραι εϲχιϲθηϲαν

**English Translation**
And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from top unto bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The visible sanctuary mourns the destruction of the invisible Shrine. The veil is torn not from below by human hands, but from above, signifying the end of the hidden mysteries of the old law. The very earth and stones, lacking a soul, yet shudder in sympathy with the Creator, rebuking the hardness of the hearts of men who remain unmoved.

**Verse 52**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) τα μνημια ανεωχθηϲαν και πολλα ϲωματα των κεκοιμημε αγιων ηγερ ·

**English Translation**
And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the sleeping saints were raised.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The death of the Life-giver breaks the bars of the grave. Even before the third day, the power of the Resurrection is operative, disturbing the sleep of the just. These many bodies stand as witnesses that the keys of death have been snatched away at the very moment the Lord yielded His spirit.

**Verse 53**
**Greek Text**
και εξελ εκ των μνημιων μετα την εγερϲιν αυτου ειϲ την αγιαν πο ενεφανιϲθη πολλοιϲ

**English Translation**
And coming forth out of the tombs after his arising, into the holy city, they appeared to many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the precision: the tombs open at His death, but the saints come forth only after His arising. He is the Firstfruits; the members follow the Head. They enter the holy city not to dwell there again in mortality, but to manifest the triumph to the many who dwell in the shadow.

**Verse 54**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εκατονταρχηϲ και οι μετ αυτου τηρουντεϲ τον ϊδοντεϲ τον ϲιϲμ και τα γενομενα εφοβηθηϲαν ϲφο λεγοντεϲ αλη ην του ην ουτοϲ

**English Translation**
But the centurion, and those with him guarding the [one], seeing the earthquake and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, 'Truly was of [God] was this one.'

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Gentiles perceive what the priests denied. Terror seizes the guards at the shaking of the earth, leading to a confession of truth. Even in their broken speech, acknowledging Him as belonging to the Divine, the nations begin to claim the inheritance rejected by the builders.

**Verse 55**
**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε κακει γυ πολλαι απο μακροθεν θεωρουϲαι αιτι ηκολουθηϲ τω απο τηϲ γα διακονου αυτω

**English Translation**
And there were there many women beholding from afar, who followed the [one] from Galilee, ministering to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The courage of the weak shames the cowardice of the strong. While the disciples fled, these women, bound by service and devotion, remain. They watch from a distance, yet they are near in spirit, having ministered to His physical needs in Galilee, and now attending the final liturgy of His passion.

**Verse 56**
**Greek Text**
εν αιϲ ην μαρια η μαγδαληνη κ(αι) μαρια η του ϊακω και η μαρια η ιωϲηφ και η μαρια η ιωϲηφ και η μητηρ των ϋϊων ζεβε

**English Translation**
Among whom was Maria the Magdalene, and Maria the [mother] of Jacob, and Maria the [mother] of Joseph, and Maria the [mother] of Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The names are recorded as pillars of witness. The repetition of Maria emphasizes the specific identity of the witnesses against any confusion. These mothers and disciples stand guard over the body, ensuring that the identity of the One who died is the same as the One who shall rise.

**Verse 57**
**Greek Text**
οψιαϲ δε γενομε ηλθεν πλουϲιοϲ απο α τουνο ϊωϲηφʼ οϲ και αυτοϲ εμαθητευ τω

**English Translation**
And evening having come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, by name Joseph, who also himself was discipled to the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Providence prepares a tomb suitable for a King. A rich man serves the One who became poor, showing that wealth may be sanctified by service to the Body. He comes at evening, the time of rest, to offer rest to the One who labored for our salvation.

**Verse 58**
**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ προϲελθων τω πιλατω ητηϲατο το ϲωμα του το ο πιλατοϲ εκε αποδοθη αποδοθηναι

**English Translation**
This one, approaching Pilate, asked for the body of the [Lord]. Then Pilate commanded it to be given back.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Boldness enters the heart of the secret disciple. He claims the body not as a corpse of a criminal, but as a precious treasure. Pilate grants the request, unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy that He would be with the rich in His death, releasing the victim from the jurisdiction of the state into the care of the faithful.

**Verse 59**
**Greek Text**
και λαβων το ϲω ο ϊωϲηφʼ ενε αυτο ϲιν καθαρα

**English Translation**
And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The purity of the linen corresponds to the purity of the Victim. There are no spices mentioned here, only the clean winding sheet, signifying the simplicity and incorruption of the Body. As He was born in swaddling clothes, so He departs in linen, naked of worldly goods but clothed in righteousness.

**Verse 60**
**Greek Text**
και εθηκεν εν τω καινω αυτου μνη ο ελατομη εν τη πετρα και προϲκυλιϲαϲ λιθον μεγαν τη θυρα του μνημι απηλθεν

**English Translation**
And he laid [it] in his new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he departed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
It must be a new tomb, lest any other dead be confused with the Living One. Hewn from rock, it signifies the strength and permanence of the mystery. The great stone seals the door, marking the end of the earthly ministry and the beginning of the Sabbath rest of the Creator in the heart of the earth.

**Verse 61**
**Greek Text**
ην δε εκει μαρι η μαγδαληνη και η αλλη μαρια καθημενε καθημεναι απε του ταφου ˙

**English Translation**
And there was Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting [sitting] opposite the tomb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The faithful women remain when others have fled, maintaining a vigil of sorrow. Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary assume the posture of "sitting," indicating a settled and persistent waiting rather than a fleeting glance. They position themselves "opposite the tomb," fixing their eyes upon the physical reality of death, ensuring that the location of the body is known and watched, unknowingly preparing to be the first witnesses of what follows the silence.

**Verse 62**
**Greek Text**
τη δε επαυριον η εϲτιν μετα τ παραϲκευην ϲυ ϲ οι αρ και οι φα προϲ πι

**English Translation**
Now on the morrow, which is after the preparation, were gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees to Pilate.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The temporal notation "after the preparation" marks the Sabbath, yet the chief priests and Pharisees do not rest in God. Instead, they violate the spirit of the holy day by gathering to a Gentile ruler, Pilate. Their assembly is driven by anxiety rather than worship, uniting distinct factions of the law against the one who fulfilled it, showing that their enmity towards the Truth is greater than their observance of the ritual.

**Verse 63**
**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ · εμνηϲθημ οτι εκινοϲ ο πλα ειπεν ετι ζ μετα τριϲ ημεραϲ εγιρομαι

**English Translation**
Saying: We remembered that that deceiver said, while still living, After three days I rise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
It is a profound irony that the enemies of the Lord remember His words more clearly than His own followers. They label the Truth "that deceiver," yet they tremble at His promise. By recalling that He said, "After three days I rise," they testify that this prophecy was known and public, thereby stripping themselves of the excuse of ignorance regarding His claims of authority over death.

**Verse 64**
**Greek Text**
κελευ ουν αϲφαλι τον ταφ εωϲ τηϲ τριτηϲ ημεραϲ μηποτε ελθοντεϲ οι μαθη κλεψουϲιν αυ και ειπωϲιν τω λαω ηγερθη α των νεκρων και εϲται η εϲχα πλανη χειρ χειρ τηϲ πρωτηϲ

**English Translation**
Command therefore the tomb to be secured until the third day, lest coming the disciples steal him, and say to the people, He was raised from the dead, and the last deception will be worse [worse] than the first.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They seek to "secure the tomb" to prevent a theft, fearing the disciples' influence on the people. In their calculation, they declare that a belief in the resurrection—which they name the "last deception"—would be "worse" than His earthly ministry. Unwittingly, they prepare the stage so that the resurrection cannot be attributed to theft; by ensuring the tomb is guarded, they guarantee that the emptiness of the grave will be the work of God, not man.

**Verse 65**
**Greek Text**
εφη δε αυτοιϲ ο πι εχετε κουϲ · ϋπαγετε αϲφαλιϲαϲθαι ωϲ οιδατε

**English Translation**
And Pilate said to them, You have a guard; go, make it secure as you know.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate grants them the resources of the state, saying "You have a guard," but he limits the command to the scope of their own understanding: "as you know." He challenges them to use their utmost human skill and worldly power to bind the dead. The instruction exposes the futility of their wisdom, for they attempt to secure the Creator with the tools of the creature, unaware that no seal can hold the Source of Life.

**Verse 66**
**Greek Text**
οι δε πορευ ηϲφαλιϲ τον ταφον ϲφρα τον λιθ μετα τηϲ κουϲτω

**English Translation**
And they, having gone, secured the tomb, sealing the stone with the guard.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They depart to execute their futile defense, combining the legal authority of "sealing the stone" with the physical force of the "guard." By adding the seal, they close the only exit, and by setting the watch, they eliminate the possibility of intrusion. Thus, the enemies of the Lord provide the strongest historical testimony to the reality of the miracle; for when the stone is found rolled away, it is against the seal and the guard that the power of God has triumphed.
