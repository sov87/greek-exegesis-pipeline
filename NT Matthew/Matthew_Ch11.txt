**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο οτε ετελεϲεν ο δια τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου μετεβη εκειθ του διδαϲκιν και κηρυϲϲιν εν ταιϲ πολεϲιν αυτων

**English Translation**
And it came to pass when he finished the ordering to his disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master concludes his charge, yet he does not rest. Having finished the ordering (`δια`) of his disciples, he himself acts, departing (`μετεβη`) to perform the very tasks of teaching (`διδαϲκιν`) and preaching (`κηρυϲϲιν`) he has entrusted to others. The work is shared; the cities belong to them (`αυτων`), yet he enters them to establish the word.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ϊωαννηϲ α εν τω δε τα ερ του πεμψαϲ δια των μαθητ αυτου

**English Translation**
Now John, hearing in the prison the works of the [Christ], sending through his disciples,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Confinement in the prison (`δε`) cannot bind the hearing (`α`) of the spirit. John perceives the works (`ερ`) from afar. Even in chains, his ministry continues through agency; he does not go himself but acts by sending (`πεμψαϲ`) those who follow him (`μαθητ`), linking his own school to the manifestation of power he discerns.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ειπεν αυτω ϲυ ει ο ερχομενοϲ η ετερον προϲδο

**English Translation**
said to him, Art thou the coming one, or do we look for another?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question strikes at the heart of identity: "Art thou" (`ϲυ ει`). The title is singular and absolute—"the coming one" (`ο ερχομενοϲ`). There is no room for duality; if he is not the fulfillment, the expectation (`προϲδο`) must entirely shift to another (`ετερον`). The query demands a verdict on the arrival of the promised age.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθιϲ ο ειπεν αυτοιϲ πο απαγ τω ϊωαννη α ακουετε και βλε

**English Translation**
And answering he said to them, Going report to John what things ye hear and see:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He does not answer with a simple affirmation but with a command to witness. They must go (`πο`) and report (`απαγ`) empirical evidence. The proof of his identity lies not in titles but in what is heard (`ακουετε`) and seen (`βλε`). The messengers are transformed into observers of the divine operation.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
τυφλοι ανα και χω περιπατουϲ περιπατουϲ λεπροι καθαριζ και κωφοι ακου και νεκροι εγιροντε και πτω ευαγγελιζοντε

**English Translation**
Blind receive sight, and lame walk, walk, lepers are cleansed, and deaf hear, and dead are raised, and poor are evangelized.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The catalogue of miracles confirms the era of restoration. The physical infirmities—blindness, lameness, leprosy, deafness, death—are overturned by the authority present. The repetition of "walk" (`περιπατουϲ`) emphasizes the reality of the cure. The culmination is the spiritual elevation of the lowly: the poor (`πτω`) are evangelized (`ευαγγελιζοντε`), marking the true abundance of the kingdom.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και μακαριοϲ εϲ · οϲ εαν μη ϲκ ϲκ εν εμοι

**English Translation**
And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A beatitude (`μακαριοϲ`) is pronounced upon the steadfast. The danger lies in being offended (`ϲκ`) by the humble or unexpected nature of his appearance. The blessing is reserved for the one who finds no stumbling block in him (`εν εμοι`), accepting the mystery of the works without demanding a different form of glory.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
τουτων δε πορευ ηρξατο ο λεγιν τοιϲ οχλοιϲ περι ϊωαννου τι εξηλθατε ειϲ τ τ ερημον θεαϲαϲθε καλαμον ϋπο α ϲαλευομε

**English Translation**
And as these were departing, he began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by wind?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As the messengers depart (`πορευ`), the discourse turns to the multitude (`οχλοιϲ`). The setting of John's ministry was the wilderness (`ερημον`), a place of austerity. The rhetorical question denies frailty; John is no reed (`καλαμον`) utilized by the wind (`α`) to be shaken (`ϲαλευομε`). The wilderness requires a firmness that defies the shifting airs of the world.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
αλλα τι εξηλ α ϊδιν ϊδιν α ϊδιν α εν μαλακοιϲ ημ · ϊδου οι τα μαλακα φο εν τοιϲ οι των βαϲιλε ειϲιν

**English Translation**
But what went ye out to see, to see? A man clothed in soft [things]? Behold, those wearing soft things are in the houses of kings.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "to see" (`ϊδιν`) presses the intent of their journey. It was not for luxury. A man clothed (`ημ`) in softness (`μαλακοιϲ`) belongs to the palaces, the houses (`οι`) of kings (`βαϲιλε`). The prophet stands apart from royal comfort; his authority is not derived from the vestments of the court but from the stark reality of his mission.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
αλλα τι εξηλθα προφητην ϊδ ϊδ προφητην ναι λεγω υμιν κ(αι) περιϲϲοτερον προφητου

**English Translation**
But why went ye out? To see a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The people sought a prophet (`προφητην`), and they found one. Yet, the reality exceeds the office. He is "more than" (`περιϲϲοτερον`) a prophet. The affirmation "Yea, I say to you" (`ναι λεγω υμιν`) elevates John beyond the historical line of seers, placing him in a unique proximity to the fulfillment of the ages.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ εϲτιν περι ου γε ϊδου εγω αποϲτελ τον αγγελον μου προ προϲω ϲου οϲ καταϲκευ την οδον ϲου εμπροϲθεν ϲου

**English Translation**
This is [he] concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Scripture (`γε` for `γεγραπται`) authenticates his role. He is the specific messenger (`αγγελον`) sent by the Divine "I" (`εγω`) before the face (`προϲω`) of the Coming One. His task is technical and immediate: to prepare (`καταϲκευ`) the way (`οδον`). He is the precursor who bridges the gap between the prophecy and the presence.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν ουκ εγηγερτε εν γεννητοιϲ γυνε μιζων ϊω του βαπτιϲτου ο δε μικροτεροϲ εν τη βαϲιλια τ ο ο μιζων αυτου εϲτιν

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, there has not risen among [those] born of women [one] greater than John the Baptist; but the lesser in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A distinction is drawn between the natural order and the spiritual realm. Among those born of women (`γεννητοιϲ γυνε`), John (`ϊω`) holds the highest rank (`μιζων`). Yet, the kingdom (`βαϲιλια`) introduces a new standard of greatness. The lesser (`μικροτεροϲ`) within this new economy transcends the pinnacle of the old, for they participate in the reality John only heralded.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
απο δε των ημερ ϊωαννου του βα εωϲ αρτι η βαϲιλια των ου βιαζετε κ(αι) βιαζετε βιαϲτε αρπαζου αυτην

**English Translation**
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens is forced, and is forced, [and] violent ones seize it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Since the days (`ημερ`) of the Baptist, a new urgency has seized the cosmos. The kingdom (`βαϲιλια`) is not passive; it is subject to force (`βιαζετε`). The repetition underscores the intensity of this movement. Violent ones (`βιαϲτε`)—those with desperate, consuming zeal—seize (`αρπαζου`) it. Possession of the holy requires a vigor that breaks through the inertia of the age.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
παντεϲ γαρ οι προ και ο νομοϲ εωϲ ϊωαννου ε

**English Translation**
For all the [ones] before and the law until John [prophesied].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The history of revelation is partitioned into two great epochs. The Law and those who preceded John spoke with a voice of anticipation, pointing forward to a reality they had not yet touched. With John, that preparatory age concludes, fulfilling the boundary of the ancient promises.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και ει θελετε δε αυτοϲ εϲτ ηλιαϲ ο μελλων ερχεϲθε

**English Translation**
And if you wish [to receive it], he is Elias, the one about to come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The identification of the forerunner depends upon the volition of the hearer. Elias returns not in fleshly identity but in the spirit and power of the office. Only those who submit their will to the divine economy can perceive the fulfillment of the prophecy in the person present.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ο εχων ωτα ακουειν ακου

**English Translation**
The one having ears to hear, let him hear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Physical possession of ears does not guarantee spiritual reception. To "have ears to hear" implies an active, interior capacity to discern the voice of truth. The command compels the hearer to move from passive auditing to active understanding.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
τινι δε ομοιωϲω την γενεαν ταυτ ομοια εϲτιν παιδι καθημενοιϲ εν τεϲ αγορεϲ ταιϲ αγοραιϲ α προϲ τοιϲ ε

**English Translation**
But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the markets [the markets], who [call] to the [companions].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This generation displays the petulance of idle youth sitting in the public squares. By repeating the location of the markets, the text emphasizes the worldly, transactional theater of their refusal. They treat the divine vocation as a game, judging the messengers rather than heeding the message.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
λεγουϲιν η ϋμιν και ουκ ωρχηϲαϲθε εθρηνηϲαμεν και ουκ εκοψαϲθε

**English Translation**
They say: We [piped] to you and you did not dance; we lamented and you did not mourn.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heart of this generation is hardened against every mode of divine appeal. They are moved neither by the joyous melody of grace, which invites dancing, nor by the solemn dirge of repentance, which calls for mourning. Their spiritual lethargy renders them unresponsive to both celebration and contrition.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ηλθεν γαρ ϊωαν μητε εϲθι μητε πινων και λεγουϲιν δεμονι δαιμονιον εχει

**English Translation**
For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say: He has a demon [demon].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Asceticism and severe self-denial are slandered by the worldly as madness or demonic possession. John’s refusal of earthly comfort is interpreted not as holiness, but as an aberration, proving that the wicked will always find a pretext to reject the righteous.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ηλθεν ο του εϲθι και πινων κ(αι) και λεγουϲιν ϊδου α φαγοϲ και οι φιλοϲ τελωνων και α και ε η ϲοφι απο των εργων αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
The [Son] of [Man] came eating and drinking, and [and] they say: Behold a man, a glutton and [wine-drinker], a friend of tax-collectors and [sinners]. And wisdom was [justified] by her works.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
When the divine approach shifts from asceticism to communion, the world still finds fault, labeling it gluttony and loose association. Yet Wisdom is not vindicated by the approval of the critics, but by the tangible fruit of her works among the tax-collectors and those willing to receive her.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ηρξατο ονιδι ταϲ πολειϲ εν αιϲ εγενοντο αι πλιϲται δυνα αυτου οτι ου με

**English Translation**
Then he began to reproach the cities in which his most powers were done, because they did not [repent].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manifestation of divine power brings with it a terrifying responsibility. Miracles are not mere spectacles but summons to repentance. The reproach falls heavily upon those who witness the intrusion of heaven into earth and yet refuse to alter their lives.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ουαι ϲοι χοραζειν ουαι ϲοι βηδϲαιδ βηδϲαιδ βηδϲαϊδα οτι ει η εν τυρω και ϲιδωνι εγενον αι δυναμιϲ αι γε εν ϋμ παλαι αν εν ϲακ και ϲποδω κα μετενο

**English Translation**
Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida [Bethsaida Bethsaida]! For if the powers which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have [repented] long ago [sitting] in sackcloth and ashes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering repetition of the name Bethsaida amplifies the tragedy of its unbelief. The pagan cities of Tyre and Sidon, known for their pride and commerce, are judged less harsh than the covenant people who saw the powers of God and remained unmoved. Greater light ignored incurs greater condemnation.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
πλην λεγω ϋμιν τυρω και ϲιδωνι ανεκτοτερον εϲτε εν ημερα κριϲεωϲ η ϋμιν

**English Translation**
But I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine justice measures culpability by opportunity. Tyre and Sidon lacked the direct visitation of the powers witnessed by the Galilean cities. Therefore, the day of judgment will be an unbearable terror for those who squandered the immediate presence of the Truth.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυ καφαρναουμ μη εωϲ ο ϋ εωϲ αδου καταβιβαϲθηϲη οτι ει εν ϲοδομοιϲ εγενηθηϲαν αι δυ αι γενομε εν ϲοι εμειν ϋμιν ε̣μ̣ε̣ι̣ν̣ αν μεχρι τηϲ ϲημε

**English Translation**
And you, Capharnaum, not unto [heaven]? Unto Hades you shall be brought down. For if the powers which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained [to you] [remained] until this day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Capharnaum, the very headquarters of the ministry, presumed a height equal to heaven but faces a depth equal to Hades. Even Sodom, the archetype of divine wrath, would have endured had it received the grace poured out upon this city. Privilege without repentance is the surest path to destruction.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
πλην λεγω ϋμιν οτι α εϲτε γη ϲοδομων εν η κριϲεωϲ η ϲοι

**English Translation**
But I say to you that it shall be [more tolerable] for the land of Sodom in the [day] of judgment than for you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verdict is final and startling: the land of Sodom will find more mercy at the judgment than the city that hosted the Lord. Rejection of the visible work of God hardens the soul more thoroughly than the ignorance of the ancients.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
εν εκινω τω καιρω αποκριθιϲ ο ειπ εξομολογουμαι ϲοι του ου και τηϲ γηϲ οτι εκρυψαϲ ταυτα απο ϲοφων και ϲυ και απεκα αυτα νηπι

**English Translation**
In that time answering the [one] said: I confess to you of the heaven and of the earth, that you hid these things from wise [ones] and intelligent [ones] and revealed them to infants.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The speaker claims a singular authority in that specific time, addressing the dominion "of the heaven and of the earth." We observe a divine economy of concealment and disclosure; wisdom and intelligence, often celebrated by men, here serve as veils preventing access to the mysteries. Instead, it is the *nepi*—the infants, the voiceless, the simple—to whom the revelation (*apeka*) is granted. The text demonstrates that knowledge of these hidden things is not seized by intellect but received by those who lack the pretension of the wise.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
ναι ο οτι ουτωϲ ευδοκια εγενετο εμπρο ϲου

**English Translation**
Yes, the [one], for thus good pleasure came to be before you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The affirmation "Yes" ratifies the divine will as absolute "good pleasure" (*eudokia*). This pleasure is not a distant decree but occurs *empro sou*—before you, in your very presence. The event of this good pleasure is accomplished within the immediate sight of the one addressed, confirming an intimate and approving witness to the hiding from the wise and the revealing to the infants.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
παντα μοι παρε ϋπο του μου και ουδιϲ επιγινω τον ει μη ο ουδε τον τιϲ επιγινωϲκι ει μη ο και ω εαν βουλητε ο απο

**English Translation**
All things to me were delivered by the [one] of me; and no one knows the [one] except the [one], nor the [one] anyone knows except the [one], and to whom if wills the [one] to reveal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the total delivery (*pare*) of authority, handed down "by the [one] of me." The text delineates a closed circle of knowledge (*epigino*) accessible only to the inherent relation between the "me" and the "of me." No outside observer penetrates this knowing; it is exclusive to the persons involved. Access is granted to humanity only through a specific act of will: "to whom if wills the [one] to reveal." Thus, revelation is an act of volition proceeding from this unique, shared knowledge.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
δευτε προϲ με π οι κοπιωντεϲ και πεφορτιϲμε καγω αναπαυ υμαϲ

**English Translation**
Come to me all the laboring ones and burdened ones, and I will give rest to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The summons is universal (*p* for *pantes*—all) yet specifically targeted at those in a state of exhaustion. The "laboring ones" and "burdened ones" are invited not to a doctrine, but to a person ("Come to me"). The promise corresponds to the condition: for labor, there is the cessation of toil; for the burden (*pephortisme*), there is the active provision of rest (*anapau*). The speaker possesses the inherent capacity to grant this rest to the weary.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
αρατε τον ζυγον μ(ου) εφ υμαϲ και μαθε μαθετε απ εμου μαθετε απ εμου οτι πραϋϲ ειμι και ταπινοϲ τη καρ και ευρηϲετε αναπαυϲιν ταιϲ ψυχεϲ ϋμων

**English Translation**
Take the yoke of me upon you and learn, learn from me, learn from me, that meek I am and humble in the heart; and you shall find rest for the souls of you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to "take the yoke" is immediately followed by a threefold urgency to "learn" (*mathe mathete... mathete*). This repetition emphasizes that the instruction is paramount. The content of this learning is the character of the speaker: meekness and humility of heart. Unlike the burdens of the world, this yoke is educational and bound to the nature of the one who gives it. The result is not merely bodily rest, but a finding of rest specifically for the "souls" (*psyches*) of the hearers.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ο γαρ ζυγοϲ μου χρη και το φορτι μου ελαφρον ε

**English Translation**
For the yoke of me [is] kind, and the burden of me light is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rationale for the previous command is the quality of the instrument used. The yoke is described as *chri* (kind, useful, or good), indicating it fits the bearer well without galling. The burden is explicitly "light." The final *e* (is) asserts this as an ontological fact: the requirements of this master do not crush the laborer but sustain him. The paradox of a light burden confirms the divine nature of the yoke-giver.
