**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
εν δε ταιϲ ημερεϲ εκειναιϲ παραγει παραγινεται ϊωανʼνηϲ ο βαπτιϲτηϲ · κηρυϲ εν τη ερημω τηϲ ϊουδεαϲ

**English Translation**
Now in those days arrives—comes—John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the temporal marker "in those days," signifying a divinely appointed season. The text initially reads "arrives" (*paragei*) but corrects to "comes" (*paraginetai*), emphasizing the historical reality of his advent. He is defined not by his father, but by his office: "the Baptist." He appears not in the palaces of kings but in the "wilderness," a place of desolation where the soul is stripped of worldly comfort to hear the proclamation of God.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
λεγ μετανοεῖτε ηγʼγι γαρ η βαϲιλια βαϲιλεῖα των ·

**English Translation**
Saying: Repent! For near is the kingdom of [the heavens].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The primary command of the herald is *metanoeite*: a total transformation of the mind and will. The urgency is dictated by the proximity (*ēngiken*) of the Royal Dominion (*basileia*). The scribe’s correction of the spelling of "kingdom" underscores its weight. The phrase ends abruptly with the genitive article "of the..." (*tōn*), pointing our hearts inevitably upward to the heavens, the source of this new reign.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
‾̷‾ ου γαρ εϲτιν ο ρη δια ηϲαιου του προφητου > λεγον · φωνη > βοων εν τη ερημω · > ἑτοιμαϲατε την > οδον ευθιαϲ > ποιειται ποιειτε ταϲ > τρι αυτου ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
For this is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying: Voice crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of [the] Lord, straight make his paths.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John is identified as the fulfillment of the ancient oracle. He is the "Voice" (*phōnē*) that precedes the Eternal Word. His location remains the wilderness, signaling a new Exodus. The imperative is dual: "prepare" the road and "make straight" (*euthias poieite*) the paths (*tribous*). The correction in the verb *poieite* (make/do) reinforces the active duty of the soul to remove the obstacles of sin before the Lord's arrival.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ δε ὁ ϊωανʼ ειχεν το εν ἁυτου απο τριχων καμηλου και ζωνην δερ περι την ὂϲφυν ἁυτου η δε τροφη ην αυ ακριδεϲ · και με αγριον ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Now John himself had his garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his loin; and his food was locusts and wild honey.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Baptist's authority is clad in asceticism. His "garment" (*endyma*) of camel hair and "leather belt" recall the prophet Elijah, binding up his loins for service. His sustenance is distinct from the luxury of the city; he consumes "locusts and wild honey," foods provided directly by creation, signifying a life entirely dependent on Providence and separated from the softness of the world.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
τοτε εξεπορευε προϲ αυτον ϊ και παϲα ἡ ϊουδεα ϊουδαῖα κ(αι) παϲα ἡ περιχω του ϊορδανου

**English Translation**
Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the magnetic power of holiness: the city of Jerusalem (*Hierosolyma*) and the entire province "went out" (*exeporeueto*) to the desert. The spelling correction of *Ioudaia* confirms the scope of the movement. They leave the center of religious establishment to find God at the boundary line, the "region around the Jordan," the river of crossing.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και εβαπτιζοντο εν τω ϊορδανη ποταμω αυτου εξομο ταϲ ἁμαρτιαϲ ἁυ : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And they were baptized in the Jordan river by him, confessing their sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The action is passive, *ebaptizonto*: they submitted to the washing. The location is the "River Jordan," the waters of transition. But the ritual is efficacious only when accompanied by the soul's work: *exomologoumenoi*, "confessing out" their sins. The water cleanses the body only as the confession purges the conscience.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε πολʼλουϲ των φαριϲαιων και ϲαδʼδουκαι ερχομενουϲ ε το βαπτιϲμα αυτου εῖπεν αυτοιϲ · γενʼ εχιδνῶν τιϲ ϋ φυγιν απο τηϲ μελʼλουϲηϲ ορ · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: Offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John discerns the spirits. Seeing the religious elites—Pharisees and Sadducees—he exposes their nature as a "brood of vipers" (*gennēmata echidnōn*), referencing the serpent of old. He challenges their motive: are they truly repenting, or merely trying to "flee" (*phygein*) the impending divine judgment, the "coming wrath" (*mellousēs orgēs*)?

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ποιηϲάτε ουν καρ αξιον τηϲ με ·

**English Translation**
Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True conversion is not merely verbal; it requires tangible evidence. The command is *poiēsate* (do/make/produce) "fruit" (*karpon*) that weighs equal to the claim of repentance (*metanoias*). A barren tree cannot claim to be alive; neither can a sinner claim grace without the fruit of a changed life.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και μη δο λεγιν εν ε εχο τον αβρααμʼ λεγω γαρ ὁ δυναται ο εκ των λιθων του εγιραι εγεῖραι τεκνα τω αβρααμʼ ·

**English Translation**
And do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham [as father]; for I say to you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He strikes at the root of their pride: hereditary privilege. "Do not presume" (*mē doxēte*) that lineage saves. God’s power is creative, not biological; He can call life out of dead matter, "out of these stones" (*ek tōn lithōn*), just as He formed Adam from clay. To be a child of Abraham is a matter of faith, not flesh.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ηδη δε ἡ αξίνη προϲ ‾̷‾ την ριζαν των δ κειται παν ουν δενδρον μη ποιουν καρπον καλον εκκοπτε και ειϲ πυρ βαλʼ · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And already the axe lies at the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment is not distant; it is imminent. The "axe" (*axinē*) is already positioned (*keitai*) not at the branches, but at the "root." The examination is radical. The outcome for fruitlessness is severance (*ekkoptetai*) and destruction by "fire" (*pyr*), symbolizing total purification and judgment.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
εγω μεν γαρ βαπτιζω εν εν βαπτιζω ειϲ μετανοι ὁ δε οπιϲω μου ερχομενοϲ ϊϲ μου εϲτιν ὁυ ουκʼ ειμι ϊκανοϲ τα βαϲταϲαι αυ βαπτιϲι εν ἁγιω και πυ ˙

**English Translation**
I indeed baptize [you] in [water] unto repentance; but the one coming after me is stronger than I, whose [sandals] I am not sufficient to carry; he will baptize [you] in [the] Holy [Spirit] and fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John distinguishes the shadow from the substance. His baptism is preparatory, "unto repentance." The One following is "stronger" (*ischyroteros*). John confesses extreme humility, unworthy even of the slave's task to "carry" (*bastasai*) his sandals. The Greater Baptism is pneumatic and purgative: in the "Holy [Spirit]" and "fire," sanctifying the inner man.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ὁυ το πτῦον εν ‾̷‾ τη χειρι αυτου και διακαθαριε'ι διακατ̣αριει την ἅλωνα ἁυτου · και ϲυναξει τον ϲιτ ἁυτου ειϲ την α · το δε αχυρον κατακαυ πυρι αϲβεϲτω · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Whose winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor; and he will gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Christ is the Judge. The "winnowing shovel" (*ptyon*) separates the true from the false. He purges "his" threshing floor (*halōna*), which is the Church. The "wheat" (*siton*), the substance of the faithful, is gathered for preservation. The "chaff" (*achyron*), light and empty, faces "unquenchable fire." There is no middle ground between the barn and the fire.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
τοτε παραγινεται ο απο τηϲ γαλι επι τον ϊορ προϲ τον ϊωανʼνην του βα αυ

**English Translation**
Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of humility. The Lord "arrives" (*paraginetai*) from Galilee, descending to the Jordan. The Sinless One comes to the sinner, the Master to the servant, with the specific intent "to be baptized" (*tou baptisthēnai*). He enters the waters not to be cleansed, but to sanctify the waters for us.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ιωαννηϲ ‾̷‾ διεκωλυ αυτον · λεγ · εγω χριαν χρειαν εχω ϲου βαπτιϲθη βαπτιϲθηναι · και ϲυ ερχη προϲ με : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But John was preventing him, saying: I have need to be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John rightly perceives the inversion of order and attempts to "hinder" (*diekōlyen*) him. He confesses his own spiritual poverty: "I have need" (*chreian echō*) of Your baptism. It is the cry of the creature recognizing the Creator. "And You come to me?" expresses the shock of the Incarnation's humility.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ὁ ειπεν προϲ αυ άφεϲ αρτι ˙ ου ουτωϲ γαρ πρεπον ε ἡμαϲ ἡμιν ἡμιν πλη παϲαν δι · τοτε ‾̷‾ αφιηϲιν αυτον : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But answering Jesus said to him: Permit it now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he permits him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks with authority: "Permit it now" (*aphes arti*). This is a temporary dispensation for a greater purpose. It is "fitting" (*prepon*) to fulfill "all righteousness" (*pasan dikaiosynēn*); Christ must walk the path of the sinner to redeem the sinner. He submits to the Law to perfect it. John yields (*aphiēsin*) to the divine will.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
βαπτιϲθειϲ δε ὁ ευθυϲ ανεβη απο του και ϊ ανεωχθηϲαν αυτω οι ουρανοι και εῖ κατα ὡϲει πε κ(αι) ερχο επ αυτ ·

**English Translation**
And having been baptized Jesus immediately went up from the [water]; and lo, the heavens were opened to him and he saw [the Spirit] descending like a dove and coming upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Jesus ascends "immediately" (*euthys*) because He has no sins to confess. The cosmos responds to His presence: the heavens "were opened" (*aneōchthēsan*). The vision reveals the Spirit (*pneuma*, abbreviated *pe*) descending with the gentleness of a "dove" (*hōsei peristeran*). The Spirit rests upon the Son, anointing the Messiah for His work.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου φωνη εκ των ο λεγουϲα ὁυτοϲ ε ὁ ὑιοϲ μου ὁ α εν ὡ η ε η ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And lo, a voice out of the [heavens] saying: This is my Son, the Beloved, in whom I am well pleased.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Trinity is made manifest. The Father speaks from the heavens (*ek tōn ouranōn*), validating the Son on earth. He declares the relationship ("My Son," *ho huios mou*), the affection ("the Beloved," *ho agapētos*), and the eternal satisfaction ("in whom I am well pleased," *en hō ēudokēsa*). The baptism of Christ is the revelation of God.
