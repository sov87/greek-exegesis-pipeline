**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο οτε ε ο παν τουϲ λογουϲ του ειπεν τοιϲ μα αυτου

**English Translation**
And it came to pass when [he] finished all these words, he said to his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The completion of these sayings marks a decisive boundary. He finishes the words of instruction to begin the work of the passion. This speech is directed specifically to the disciples, signifying that the final revelation of suffering is reserved for those who have followed him.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
οιδα οτι μετα δυο ημε το παϲχα γινεται και ο ϋϊοϲ του παραδιδοται ειϲ το ϲταυρωθηναι

**English Translation**
You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of [Man] is delivered up to be crucified.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The timeline is fixed not by human conspiracy but by divine foreknowledge; the Passover and the crucifixion are inextricably linked. The Son is delivered up for this specific purpose, transforming the ancient feast into the reality of the cross.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ϲυνηχθηϲαν οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι πρεϲβυτεροι του λαου ειϲ την αυλ του αρχιερεωϲ του λεγομενου καϊαφα

**English Translation**
Then were gathered together the chief priests and the elders of the people into the court of the high priest who was called Caiaphas.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The earthly powers assemble in the court of Caiaphas, uniting the priesthood and the elders against the True Priest. They gather in a place of judgment to plot injustice, revealing the corruption seated in the chair of authority.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυνεβουλευ> ϊνα τον δολω κρατηϲω και αποκτει>

**English Translation**
And they took counsel that they might seize [him] by guile and kill [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Their counsel relies on guile, or deceit, confessing their inability to withstand the truth in open daylight. The intent is absolute and violent: to kill, showing that their hearts are set on destruction rather than law.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ελεγον δε μη εν > τη εορτη ϊνα μη > θορυβοϲ γενηται τω λαω ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They fear the tumult of the people more than the judgment of God. Their hesitation regarding the feast day springs from political calculation and cowardice, not from reverence for the holy season.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
του δε γενομε εν βηθανια > εν οικια ϲιμω>> του λεπρου

**English Translation**
Now when [he] was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He chooses the location of Bethany and the house of Simon the leper. The Lord resides with the unclean and the outcast, sanctifying the dwelling of a leper with his holy presence before his death.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
προϲηλθεν αυτω γυνη εχουϲα αλα μυρου πολυτιμου και κα επι τηϲ κεφαληϲ αυτου ανακιμενου

**English Translation**
A woman came to him having an alabaster [flask] of very precious ointment and poured it upon his head as he reclined.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The woman recognizes the worth of the one reclining; she brings what is very precious and pours it out completely. By anointing his head, she acknowledges his dignity and kingship even as he sits in the house of a leper.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ϊδοντεϲ δε οι μα ηγανακτη λεγοντεϲ ειϲ τι η απωλια αυτη

**English Translation**
But seeing it the disciples were indignant, saying, To what purpose is this waste?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples perceive the offering as destruction or waste (`απωλια`). They fail to see that nothing poured out upon the Lord can be wasted, revealing their blindness to the supreme value of his person.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
εδυνατο γαρ του πραθηναι πολ και δοθηναι πτωχοιϲ

**English Translation**
For this could have been sold for much and given to the poor.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They measure the ointment by its market price, "for much," and propose a utilitarian charity to the poor. They seek to trade the glory of the present moment for a generic act of almsgiving, misunderstanding the time.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
γνουϲ δε ο ειπ αυτοιϲ τι κοπουϲ παρεχετε τη γυνε γυναικι εργον γαρ γαρ καλ ηργαϲατο ειργαϲατο ειϲ εμε

**English Translation**
But knowing it, [he] said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? For a good work she has wrought upon me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He defends the woman against the indignation of the disciples. He classifies her action not as waste, but as a "good work," accepting the personal devotion she has wrought upon him as superior to their calculations.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
παντοτε γαρ τουϲ πτωχουϲ εχετε μεθ εαυτων εμε δε ου παντοτε ε

**English Translation**
For you always have the poor with yourselves, but me you have not always.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sharp distinction is drawn between the constant presence of the poor and the fleeting physical presence of the Lord. The opportunity to honor his body is limited and urgent, taking precedence over perpetual duties.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
βαλουϲα γαρ αυτη το μυρον τουτο επι του ϲω μου προϲ το ενταφιαϲαι με εποιηϲεν

**English Translation**
For in casting this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The woman acts prophetically, treating his living body as one ready for the tomb. She prepares him for burial, accepting the reality of his coming death which the others still ignore.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμ οπου εαν κηρυ το ευαγγελι τουτο εν ολω τω κοϲμω λαληθη και ο εποιη αυτη ειϲ μνη αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she did shall also be spoken of for a memorial of her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The proclamation of this gospel is bound to the entire cosmos ("the whole world"), carrying with it the memory of the woman's deed. The act of anointing is not merely a past event but a perpetual memorial, spoken of wherever the gospel itself is heralded. The text unites the preaching of the word with the remembrance of her service.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
τοτε πορευθιϲ ειϲ των · · ο λεγομε ϊουδαϲ ϊϲκα προϲ τουϲ αρχϊεριϲ

**English Translation**
Then having gone, one of the... called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He who is named Judas Iscariot separates himself to approach the chief priests. The text marks his movement away from the company and toward the authorities of the temple. The specific identification of his name underscores the personal agency in this departure.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ειπεν τι ι θελεται μοι δω και εγω ϋμιν παραδωϲω αυτ οι δε εϲτηϲαν αυ · · αργυρια

**English Translation**
He said, "What do you will to give me, and I will deliver him to you?" And they weighed out to him... silver pieces.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The will of the betrayer is essentially mercenary; he inquires what they will to give in exchange for the delivery of the person. The covenant is made in silver, weighed out as the price of the betrayal. The transaction reduces the delivering of him to a matter of currency and exchange.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και απο τοτε εζητι ευ ϊνα αυτον παραδω

**English Translation**
And from then he sought an opportunity that he might deliver him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
From the moment of the weighing of silver, the seeker's purpose is fixed upon the delivery. He actively looks for the opportune time, his intent governed by the agreement made. The seeking is singular: to hand him over.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
τη δε πρωτη των αζυμων προϲηλ οι μαθηται τω λεγοντεϲ που θελιϲ ετοιμαϲω ϲοι φαγιν το παϲχα

**English Translation**
Now on the first of the unleavened [days], the disciples came to the [one] saying, "Where do you will [that] I prepare for you to eat the passover?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples approach on the appointed day of unleavened bread, submitting to his will regarding the location of the feast. Their question concerns the preparation for him to eat the passover, acknowledging his authority to determine the place. The focus is on readiness for the sacred meal.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ϋπαγετε ειϲ την πολιν προϲ τον δινα · και ειπα αυτω ο διδαϲκα λεγει ο καιροϲ μου εγγυϲ εϲτιν προϲ ϲε ποιω το πα μετα των μα μου

**English Translation**
And he said, "Go into the city to such a one and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is near; with you I keep the passover with my disciples.'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Teacher asserts that "My time is near," indicating a divine chronology known to him. The instruction to go to "such a one" in the city is precise and authoritative. He declares his intention to keep the passover with his disciples, framing the event within the proximity of his specific time.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και ε οι μαθη ωϲ ϲυνεταξ αυτοιϲ ο και ητοι το παϲχα

**English Translation**
And the disciples did as the [one] appointed to them, and they prepared the passover.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples execute the command exactly as appointed to them. There is no deviation; the preparation of the passover is the direct result of their obedience to his order. The text emphasizes the fulfillment of his instructions.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
οψιαϲ δε γενομε ανεκιτο μετα των · · μαθητ

**English Translation**
Now evening having come, he reclined with the... disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As the day concludes and evening arrives, the posture is one of reclining. He is present with the disciples, sharing the table in the hours of darkness. The setting establishes the communion of the group before the impending separation.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και εϲθιοντων αυτων λεγι αμ λεγω ϋμιν οτι ειϲ εξ ϋμων παραδω με

**English Translation**
And as they were eating he says, "Amen I say to you that one of you will deliver me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the midst of the act of eating, the prophecy of betrayal is uttered. The solemn "Amen" confirms that the traitor is within the inner circle ("one of you"). The delivery of him is not an external capture but an internal handing over.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και λυπουμε ϲφοδρα ηρξ ηρξ λεγιν αυτω ειϲ εκαϲτοϲ μητι εγω ειμι

**English Translation**
And being grieved exceedingly, they began... to say to him, each one, "Is it I?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The revelation provokes exceeding grief among them. Each disciple is turned inward to self-examination, asking "Is it I?" The repetition of the inquiry by "each one" highlights the universal distress and the fear of being the instrument of betrayal.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθιϲ ει ο εμβαψαϲ με εμου την χιρα εν τω τρυβλιω . ουτοϲ με παραδωϲει

**English Translation**
And answering he said, "The one having dipped the hand with me in the bowl, this one will deliver me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The betrayer is identified by the intimate action of sharing the bowl. The hand that dips with him is the hand that delivers him. The proximity of fellowship in the meal stands in stark contrast to the act of betrayal which "this one" will perform.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
ο μεν του ανου ϋπαγι καθωϲ γε περι αυτου · ουαι δε τω ανω ε δι ου ο του α παραδι καλον ην αυτω ει ουκ εγεν ο εκι

**English Translation**
The [Son] of Man indeed goes as it is written concerning him; but woe to that man through whom the [Son] of [Man] is delivered; good it was for him if that [one] had not been born.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The departure of the [Son] of Man is governed by scriptural necessity ("as it is written concerning him"). However, this divine plan does not absolve the agent of betrayal; a profound woe is pronounced upon that man. The delivering of the [Son] of [Man] brings a fate upon the betrayer so severe that non-existence is declared preferable to his life.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθιϲ δε ϊου ο παραδιδουϲ αυτον ειπεν μη εγω ειμι ραββει λεγει αυτω ο ϲυ ειπαϲ

**English Translation**
And answering Judas, the one betraying him, said, Is it I, Rabbi? He says to him, You said [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The betrayer speaks, and in naming himself "Judas," the text identifies the agent of handing over. He addresses the Lord not as "Lord," but with the title "Rabbi," marking a distance in his heart even as he feigns ignorance. The answer "You said" is a terrible affirmation; the Lord does not accuse, but allows the betrayer’s own mouth to pronounce the truth of his condition.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
εϲθιοντων δε αυ λαβων ο αρ και ευλογηϲαϲ εκλαϲεν και εδι δουϲ δουϲ τοιϲ μαθητεϲ μαθηταιϲ ειπεν λαβετε φα τουτο εϲτιν το ϲωμα μου

**English Translation**
And as they were eating, taking the bread and having blessed, he broke and gave to the disciples, he said, Take, eat; this is my body.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The action occurs within the eating, sanctifying the nourishment. By blessing and breaking the bread, he signifies the voluntary fracture of his own humanity for the life of the world. The command "Take, eat" proves that the body is given for participation, not merely for observation; the bread is identified absolutely with the body, leaving no space for shadow or symbol alone.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και λαβων ποτηρι και ευχαριϲτη εδωκεν αυ λεγων πιετε εξ αυτου παντεϲ

**English Translation**
And taking a cup and having given thanks, he gave to them, saying, Drink of it all of you;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The giving of thanks precedes the offering of the cup, teaching the church the mode of reception. The imperative "Drink" is universalized by "all of you," binding the community together in the one cup. None are excluded from the command to partake, just as none are exempt from the need for the blood it contains.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
τουτο γαρ εϲτιν το αιμα μου τηϲ δια το περι πολ εκχυννομε ειϲ αφεϲιν αμαρτιων

**English Translation**
for this is my blood of the covenant, that being poured out for many for remission of sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The identity of the contents is declared: it is the blood of the covenant. It is not held back but is "poured out," an active expenditure for the sake of "many." The purpose is explicit and final: the "remission of sins," showing that this blood is the true price of redemption which the old sacrifices only prefigured.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
λεγω δε ϋμιν ου μη πιω απ αρτι εκ του τουτου γενημα τηϲ αμπελου εωϲ τηϲ ημεραϲ εκινηϲ οταν αυ πινω μεθ ϋμ κενον εν τη βαϲι του μου

**English Translation**
But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my [Father].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He marks a boundary in time: the "fruit of the vine" belongs to the present age, which now closes for him. The promise of the "new" drink in the "kingdom" points to a restoration of fellowship beyond the passion. He abstains now to prepare for the great feast where he will be with them again, transformed.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και ϋμνηϲαντεϲ εξηλθον ειϲ το ο των ελαιων

**English Translation**
And having hymned, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They do not depart in silence but with a hymn, arming themselves with praise before the trial. The destination is the "Mount of Olives," a place of crushing and oil, fitting for the agony that approaches. The movement is from the table of communion to the mountain of struggle.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγι αυτοιϲ ο παντεϲ ϋμιϲ ϲκανδαλιϲθηϲε εν εμοι εν τη νυκτι ταυτη γεγραπται γαρ πα τον ποιμενα και διαϲκορπιϲθη διαϲκορπιϲθηϲονται τα προβατα τηϲ ποιμνηϲ

**English Translation**
Then He says to them, All you will be scandalized in me in this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scandal is foretold as universal to the group: "all you." The scripture is cited to show that this scattering is not an accident but a fulfillment; the shepherd must be struck. The dispersion of the "sheep" is the inevitable consequence of the shepherd's passion, proving their dependence on his presence for unity.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
μετα δε το εγερθη με προαξω ϋμαϲ ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν

**English Translation**
But after I am raised, I will lead you before into Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Defeat is not the final word; "after I am raised" asserts the resurrection as a certainty. He promises to "lead" them, resuming his role as Shepherd. The return to "Galilee" signifies a gathering in the place of their first calling, reconstituting the flock that was scattered by the striking.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο πετροϲ ειπεν αυ ει κ(αι) παντεϲ ϲκαν ϲοι εγω ουδεποτε ϲκανδαλιϲθηϲομε ϲκανδαλιϲθηϲομαι

**English Translation**
And answering Peter said to him, If even all shall be scandalized in you, I never will be scandalized.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter sets himself apart from the "all," presuming a strength greater than his brothers. He uses the word "never," contradicting the Lord’s specific prophecy with his own absolute denial of weakness. This pride paves the way for his fall, as he trusts in his own resolve rather than the Word spoken to him.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο αμ λεγω ϲοι οτι εν ταυ τη νυκτι πριν αλεκτορα φωνη τριϲ με απαρνη απαρνηϲη με

**English Translation**
He said to him, Amen I say to you, that in this night, before a cock crows, three times you will deny me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord counters Peter’s "never" with a solemn "Amen." The timeframe is immediate: "in this night." The natural sign of the "cock" crowing will mark the spiritual failure. The denial will not be a singular slip but a threefold rejection, completely dismantling Peter's claim of superior fidelity.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτω ο πετροϲ καν δεη με ϲυν ϲοι αποθανιν ου μη ϲε απαρνηϲομαι ομοιωϲ και παν οι μαθηται ει

**English Translation**
Peter says to him, Even if it behoves me to die with you, I will not deny you. Likewise also all the disciples said.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter escalates his error, claiming readiness to "die with you," oblivious to the reality that only the Shepherd can die for the sheep. He refuses to hear the warning. His boldness becomes a stumbling block for the others, as "all the disciples" mimic his defiance, uniting in a false confidence before the hour of trial.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ερχεται μετ αυ ο ειϲ χωρι λεγομενον γεθ και λεγι τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυ καθιϲατε εωϲ απελθων εκι προ προϲ

**English Translation**
Then He comes with them into a place called Gethsemane, and says to his disciples, Sit until having gone away there, I pray.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They arrive at "Gethsemane," the place of the press. He commands the disciples to "sit," halting their action, while he alone proceeds to the work of prayer. The separation is necessary; the burden of the coming hour belongs to him, and he must go "away there" to address the Father, leaving human support behind.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και παραλαβων τ πετρον και τουϲ δυ ϋϊουϲ ζεβεδεου ηρξατο λυπιϲθε και αδημονιν ·

**English Translation**
And having taken Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and distressed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He selects these three witnesses to behold the hidden agony, separating them from the general body of disciples. The Lord enters the contest of sorrow, proving He possesses a true human soul capable of grief. He does not feign distress but submits to it, preparing the will for the coming struggle by experiencing the full weight of human anguish.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγει αυτοιϲ περιλυποϲ εϲτ η ψυχη μου εωϲ θανατου μινατε ωδε και γρηγορι μετ εμου

**English Translation**
Then he says to them, Sorrowful is my soul unto death; remain here and watch with me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The soul confesses its burden, revealing a sorrow vast enough to reach the threshold of death itself. By declaring His soul sorrowful, He silences those who would deny His assumption of full humanity. The command to watch establishes a communion in suffering; He desires their wakefulness as companions in this vigil against the encroaching darkness.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων μικρον επεϲεν επι προϲωπον αυ προϲευχομε και λεγων μου ει δυνατον ε εϲ παρελθατω α εμου το ποτηρι τουτο πλην ου ωϲ εγω θελω αλ ωϲ ϲυ

**English Translation**
And having gone forward a little, he fell on his face praying and saying, My [Father], if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He falls upon his face, the posture of a servant and a suppliant, grounding the flesh in humility. The prayer articulates the natural recoil of life from death, yet immediately subjugates this instinct to the greater design. He distinguishes between the will of the flesh which seeks preservation and the will which commands obedience, uniting them in the final clause: not as I will, but as you.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και ερχετε προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ και ευριϲκι αυτουϲ καθευδον και λεγι τω πε ουτωϲ ουκ ϊϲχυ μιαν ωραν γρη μετ εμου

**English Translation**
And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus, were you [pl.] not strong enough to watch one hour with me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He seeks the disciples and discovers the frailty of human nature when unsupported by grace; sleep overcomes their intent. The rebuke directs itself to Peter, exposing the gap between his earlier bold words and his present inability to endure. The failure to possess strength for even one hour demonstrates that flesh, left to itself, collapses before the spiritual demand.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
γρηγορειτε και προϲ ϊνα μη ει ειϲ πιραϲμ το μεν προθυ η δε ϲαρξ αϲθε

**English Translation**
Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Vigilance joined with prayer forms the fortress against temptation; neither suffices alone. He delineates the internal warfare where the spirit possesses readiness and zeal, yet the flesh remains without strength. This instruction confirms that the will to good exists, but the vessel of the body requires spiritual fortification to enact that will.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
παλιν εκ δευτερου απελθων προϲη ο λεγων μου ει ου δυνατε του παρελθιν εαν μη αυτο πιω γενηθη το θελημα ϲου

**English Translation**
Again a second time having gone away, he prayed, saying, My [Father], if this is not possible to pass unless I drink it, let your will be done.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The second departure deepens the acceptance of the divine decree. He no longer asks for the cup to pass but acknowledges that the drinking is the necessary means for the will to be done. The prayer shifts from the possibility of avoidance to the certainty of the act, engaging the will fully with the necessity of the sacrifice.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
και ελθων παλιν ευρεν αυτουϲ καθευ ηϲαν γαρ αυ οι οφθαλμοι βεβαρημενοι

**English Translation**
And having come again he found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He returns to witness the persistence of their infirmity. The heaviness of their eyes signifies a nature burdened by earth, unable to gaze into the spiritual depth of the moment. It demonstrates that without the active intervention of the Lord, the natural man sinks into the stupor of the senses.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
και αφιϲ αυτουϲ πα απελθων προϲ τον αυτον εκ τριτου εκ τριτου τον αυτον λογον ει παλιν :

**English Translation**
And having left them, again having gone away to the same [place] the third time, the third time [he spoke] the same word again.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He leaves them to their limitation and enters the solitude of the third petition. The repetition of the same word signifies unalterable fixity of purpose; He does not seek new arguments but confirms the original submission. The threefold act completes the cycle of preparation, sealing his will against the coming trial.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ερχετε προϲ τουϲ μαθηταϲ και λεγι αυτοιϲ καθευδετε το λοιπον και ανα ϊδου ηγγι η ωρα και ο του παραδιδο ειϲ χιραϲ αμαρτω

**English Translation**
Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep for the remaining [time] and rest; behold, the hour has drawn near, and the [Son] of [Man] is delivered into the hands of sinners.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He grants them permission to sleep, for the time of vigil has passed and the event itself is upon them. The hour, previously distant, is now present. He announces the paradox that He, the Holy One, is given over into the hands of sinners, submitting the divine authority to the grasp of the lawless.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
εγειρεϲθε αγωμεν ϊδου ηγγικεν ο πα παραδιδουϲ με

**English Translation**
Arise, let us go; behold, the one delivering me has drawn near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to arise signifies the resumption of action; He does not wait to be found but goes forth to meet the crisis. The proximity of the betrayer is known to Him by spiritual sight before physical arrival. He leads the disciples not into safety, but towards the confrontation, showing He is the master of His own passion.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
και ετι αυτου λαλουν ϊδου ϊουδαϲ ειϲ των · · ηλθεν και μετ αυτου οχλοϲ πολυϲ μετα μαχε και ξυλων α των αρχιερε αρχϊερε και πρεϲβυτερων του λαου

**English Translation**
And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the [twelve] came, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs from the high priests and elders of the people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The betrayal interrupts the word, manifesting immediately as He speaks. Judas is marked as one of the number, intensifying the horror that the enemy comes from within the fold. The crowd comes armed with swords and clubs as if against a robber, revealing their ignorance of His nature, for He requires no binding other than His own will to suffer.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
ο δε παραδιδουϲ αυ εδωκεν αυτοιϲ ϲημιον λεγων ο εαν φιληϲω αυ εϲτιν κρατηϲα αυτον ·

**English Translation**
Now the one delivering him gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I shall kiss, it is he; seize him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The betrayer employs the token of peace, the kiss, as the instrument of war. By this sign, he perverts the gesture of affection into a mark for capture. He commands them to seize the one he kisses, falsely presuming that the Lord can be held by force rather than by the divine consent to the cup.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
και ευθε προϲελθων τω ειπεν χαιρε ραββει και κατεφι αυτον

**English Translation**
And immediately approaching the [Him] he said, Hail Rabbi, and kissed Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The swiftness of the approach betrays the urgency of the evil; he calls Him "Rabbi" with his lips while his heart sells the Master. This kiss, meant as a sign of affection, is here transformed into the seal of treachery, showing that outward reverence can mask inward apostasy.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω εταιρε εφ ο παρει τοτε προϲελθοντεϲ επεβαλον ταϲ χι επι τον και ε αυτον

**English Translation**
And He said to him, Friend, for what are you present? Then approaching they laid the [hands] upon the [Him] and [seized] Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He addresses the betrayer as "Friend," refusing to return hatred for hatred, yet exposing the intent by asking the cause of his presence. The laying on of hands signifies the moment the Creator submits to the grasp of the creature, allowing sinners to bind the One who binds the cosmos.

**Verse 51**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) κ(αι) ϊδου ειϲ των μετα εκτιναϲ την χι απεϲπαϲε την μαχαιραν αυτου κ(αι) παταξαϲ τον δουλ του αρχϊερεωϲ αφι αυτου το ωτι ωτι

**English Translation**
And and behold one of those with [Him] stretching out the hand drew the sword of him and striking the slave of the high priest took off of him the ear ear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The defense of flesh relies on the sword, striking at the servant rather than the master, resulting only in the loss of hearing—the ear. The repetition of "ear" in the text emphasizes the injury to the organ of obedience; violence renders the servant unable to hear, just as the sword of the world deafens the soul.

**Verse 52**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγει αυτω ο αποϲτρεψον την μαχαιραν ϲου ειϲ τ τοπον αυτηϲ παν γαρ οι λαβοντεϲ μαχαιραν εν μα απολουντε απολουνται

**English Translation**
Then says to him the [Jesus]: Return the sword of you into the place of it; for all the taking sword in sword shall perish perish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to return the weapon to its place establishes that the Kingdom is not advanced by iron. The doom pronounced—that those taking the sword shall perish in the sword—reveals a cycle of destruction where the instrument of death consumes its wielder, doubled here to confirm the certainty of the ruin.

**Verse 53**
**Greek Text**
η δοκειϲ οτι ου δυ παρακαλεϲε τον π μου και πα μοι ωδε αρτι πλειω πλειουϲ δωδε λεγιωνων αγ λεγιωνων αγγελων λεγαιωνων αγγελων

**English Translation**
Or do you think that not [able] I beseech the Father of me and [He will present] to me here now more more twelve legions [holy] legions angels legions angels.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering abundance of "legions" and "angels" in the text reflects the overwhelming multitude of heavenly hosts available to the Son, yet held back by divine will. He possesses the power to summon the Father’s armies but chooses the path of weakness, proving that His submission is a voluntary sacrifice, not a defeat.

**Verse 54**
**Greek Text**
πωϲ ουν πληρωθωϲιν αι γραφε γραφαι οτι ουτωϲ δι δει γενεϲθε

**English Translation**
How then shall be fulfilled the scriptures scriptures that thus [it] must happen?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The necessity of the event lies in the Scriptures, which are the blueprint of redemption. If the legions were summoned, the written word would be void; thus, the suffering is endured not for lack of power, but to satisfy the truth of what must happen.

**Verse 55**
**Greek Text**
εν εκεινη τη ωρα ειπεν ο τοιϲ ο ωϲ επι ληϲτ εξηλθατε μετα μαχαιρων και ξυ ϲυλλαβειν με · καθ ημεραν εν τω ϊερω εκαθεζομ διδαϲκων και ου εκρατηϲατε με

**English Translation**
In that the hour said the [Jesus] to the [crowds]: As against a robber you came out with swords and clubs to seize me; daily in the temple I was sitting teaching and not you seized me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He contrasts their nocturnal violence with His daily, open teaching in the temple, exposing their cowardice. They hunt the Light in darkness using the weapons of bandits, treating the Teacher of peace as a criminal, while they themselves act in the shadows.

**Verse 56**
**Greek Text**
τουτο δε ολον γεγο ϊνα πληρωθω πληρωθο̣ϲιν αι γραφε γραφαι των προ τοτε οι μαθηται π αφεντεϲ αυτον εφυγον

**English Translation**
But this whole has happened that might be fulfilled fulfilled the scriptures scriptures of the pro[phets]; then the disciples [all] leaving Him fled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The flight of the disciples is the final seal on the prophecy; as the Shepherd is struck, the sheep scatter. The fulfillment of the "scriptures scriptures" underscores that this abandonment was foreseen, leaving Him in perfect solitude to bear the weight of the world.

**Verse 57**
**Greek Text**
οι δε κρατη τον απη προϲ καϊαφ τον αρχϊερεα οπου οι γραμματιϲ και οι πρεϲβυτεροι ϲυνη

**English Translation**
The but seizing the [Jesus] led away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders [gathered].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The religious authorities gather not for worship but for judgment against the Holy One. Caiaphas becomes the focal point of this assembly, where the scribes and elders unify their power to dismantle the very Law they claim to uphold.

**Verse 58**
**Greek Text**
ο δε πετροϲ ηκολου αυτω μακροθεν εωϲ τηϲ αυληϲ του αρχϊερεωϲ και ειϲ εϲω εκαθη μετα των ϋπηρε ϊδειν το τελοϲ

**English Translation**
The but Peter followed Him from afar until the court of the high priest and entering inside sat with the servants to see the end.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter follows, but the distance—"from afar"—signals the widening gap between disciple and Master. He sits with the servants rather than standing with the Lord, reducing himself to a spectator waiting to see the end, unaware that this end is a new beginning.

**Verse 59**
**Greek Text**
οι δε αρχϊεριϲ και το ϲυνεδριον ολον ε ψευδομαρ κατα του οπωϲ αυτον θανα

**English Translation**
The but high priests and the council whole [sought] false witness against the [Jesus] so that Him [they might kill].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The council seeks a lie to validate a murder, revealing that their judgment is predetermined. They do not seek the truth of the man, but a "false witness" sufficient to justify the death they have already decided in their hearts.

**Verse 60**
**Greek Text**
και ου ευρον πολλων προϲελθοντων ψευδομαρτυρ ψευδομαρτυρ ϋϲτερον δε προϲελ

**English Translation**
And not found many approaching false witnesses false witnesses later but approaching...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "false witnesses" highlights the abundance of lies that nonetheless fail to cohere against the Truth. Even in their malice, they cannot find a sufficient falsehood, for the integrity of the Victim repels their accusations until the end.

**Verse 61**
**Greek Text**
ειπαν ου εφη δυναμαι καταλυϲε τον να του και δια τρι ημερων αυτον οι

**English Translation**
They said, "This [man] stated, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and through three days to build it.'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusers bring forward a distortion of a profound truth, yet they unwittingly testify to the authority of the One standing before them. He does not deny the power to raise what has fallen, for the temple of God is indeed subject to His command. They speak of stones and mortar, but the Lord speaks of the sanctuary of His body, which shall pass through the three days of death to be established eternally.

**Verse 62**
**Greek Text**
και αναϲταϲ ο αρχι ειπεν αυτω ουδεν αποκρινη τι ουτοι ϲου καταμαρ

**English Translation**
And standing up, the high priest said to him, "Do you answer nothing? What do these witness against you?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The high priest rises in agitation, unable to bear the silence of the accused. The judge demands a defense, seeking to entrap the Word in a web of human argument. Yet, the silence of the Lamb is more powerful than the clamor of the witnesses, for He offers no rebuttal to falsehood, allowing the weight of their own confused testimony to hang in the air.

**Verse 63**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εϲιωπα και ο αρχϊερευϲ ειπεν αυτω εξορκιζω ϲε κατα του του ζωντοϲ ϊνα ημιν ειπηϲ ει ϲυ ει ο ο του

**English Translation**
But he was silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Silence provokes the ultimate demand, compelling the high priest to invoke the name of the living God. The question strikes at the heart of the mystery: is this the Anointed One, the Son? The interrogation moves from the destruction of the temple to the identity of the Architect. The adjuration binds the accused to speak the truth, turning the trial into a moment of divine revelation.

**Verse 64**
**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ο ϲυ ει πλην λεγω ϋ απ αρτι οψεϲ τον του καθημενον εκ δε τηϲ δυναμε και ερχομενον επι των νεφελ νεφελ του ο

**English Translation**
He says to him, "You said [it]. However, I say to you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds, the clouds of heaven."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He accepts the title spoken by his judge, turning the accusation into a confession. But He immediately directs their eyes from the humiliation of the present judgment to the glory of the future enthronement. The Son of Man shall not merely stand to be judged but shall sit at the right hand of Power to rule. The clouds of heaven signify that His authority is not of the earth, and His return will vindicate the One now condemned.

**Verse 65**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ο αρχιερευϲ διερ τα ϊματια αυ και λεγει ϊδε λεγων ε τι ετι χριαν εχομεν μαρτυριων ϊδε ν ν ηκουϲατε την βλα

**English Translation**
Then the high priest tore his garments and says, "See! He has spoken blasphemy! What further need do we have of witnesses? See! Now you have heard the blasphemy."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tearing of the priestly vestments signifies the end of the old priesthood, rent asunder by the rejection of the Truth. The high priest declares the truth of God's power to be blasphemy, sealing his own blindness. He dismisses the need for witnesses because the Truth has spoken clearly, and to those who love darkness, the Light sounds like an offense.

**Verse 66**
**Greek Text**
τι ϋμιν δοκει οι δε αποκρι ειπαν ειπον ενο θανατου εϲτ εϲτ

**English Translation**
"What does it seem to you?" And answering they said, "He is liable to death."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The council is unified in its error, pronouncing the Author of Life to be a subject of death. They judge by appearance and adhere to the letter of their law while violating its Spirit. In declaring Him liable to death, they unwittingly prepare the sacrifice that will conquer death itself.

**Verse 67**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ενεπτυϲαν ειϲ το προϲωπον αυ και εκολαφιϲαν αυτον οι δε εραπιϲ εραπιϲ

**English Translation**
Then they spat into his face and buffeted him; and others slapped [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The malice of the heart manifests in the violence of the hand. They defile the face that angels desire to behold, returning spittle for the breath of life. He endures the buffetings and slaps, absorbing the wrath of man to reveal the patience of God. The degradation of the prisoner exposes the savagery of the judges.

**Verse 68**
**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ προφη ημιν τιϲ εϲτιν ο παιϲαϲ ϲε

**English Translation**
Saying, "Prophesy to us! Who is the one who struck you?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They mock the prophetic office, demanding signs while blind to the Sign standing amongst them. They treat the knowledge of God as a parlor game, taunting Him to identify His tormentors. Yet, in their mockery, they acknowledge Him as one who claims to see what is hidden, even as they hide their own faces in shame.

**Verse 69**
**Greek Text**
ο δε πετροϲ εκαθη εξω εν τη αυλη και προϲηλθεν αυ μια παιδιϲκη λεγουϲα και ϲυ ηϲθα μετα του γαλιλεου

**English Translation**
But Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard; and one servant-girl came to him, saying, "And you were with the Galilean."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the Lord stands within, confessing the truth before the mighty, Peter sits without, vulnerable to the weak. The accusation comes not from a high priest, but from a servant-girl, naming the Lord by his earthly region. To be "with the Galilean" is the charge, marking discipleship as a matter of presence and association, now tested by fear.

**Verse 70**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ηρνηϲατο εμ παντ παντ λεγων ουκ οιδα τι λεγειϲ

**English Translation**
But he denied [it] before all, saying, "I do not know what you say."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The denial is public, enacted before all present. Peter seeks refuge in feigned ignorance, claiming not to understand the speech of the accuser. By denying knowledge of the saying, he begins to sever the bond with the Word. Fear drives the disciple to separate himself from the Master, protecting the body by denying the soul's allegiance.

**Verse 71**
**Greek Text**
εξελθοντα δε ειϲ τον πυλωνα ειδεν αυτον αλλη και λεγει τοιϲ εκει ουτοϲ ην μετα του ναζωραιου

**English Translation**
And having gone out into the gateway, another [girl] saw him and says to those there, "This one was with the Nazarene."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Retreating to the gateway offers no escape from the truth of his identity. Another voice raises the cry, identifying him not merely with a region, but with the Nazarene Himself. The witness of the world is persistent; they recognize the followers of the Way even when the followers wish to remain hidden.

**Verse 72**
**Greek Text**
και παλιν ηρνηϲα μετα ορκου ου οιδα τον

**English Translation**
And again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the [man]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sin compounds; a simple denial becomes a sworn oath. He calls God to witness a lie, claiming total ignorance of the Man he once confessed as the Son of God. The descent is rapid: from sitting outside, to feigning ignorance, to swearing separation. In seeking to save his life, he loses his connection to the Life.

**Verse 73**
**Greek Text**
μετα μικρον δε προϲελθοντεϲ οι εϲτωτεϲ ειπον τω πετρω αληθωϲ και ϲυ εξ αυτων ει · και γαρ η λαλια ϲου δηλον ϲε ποιει ·

**English Translation**
And after a little while, those standing by came and said to Peter, "Truly you also are of them; for even your speech makes you manifest."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe how the internal nature of a man cannot be concealed by mere proximity to the world; truth forces its way through the very tongue. Peter stands among the accusers, attempting to blend his presence with theirs, yet his speech—the instrument of his confession—betrays his origin. It is impossible for one who has conversed with the Light to remain hidden in darkness, for the very accent of his soul has been altered. He is "of them," the company of the faithful, and this identity is made manifest even against his will, proving that the mark of discipleship is indelible upon the voice.

**Verse 74**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ηρξατο κατα και ο οτι ουκ οι τον και ευ αλεκτωρ ε

**English Translation**
Then he began to curse and swear that "I know not the [man]"; and immediately a rooster [crowed].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The descent of the soul is rapid when fear governs the will. He does not merely deny, but begins to curse and bind himself with oaths, piling sin upon sin to fortify a lie. He claims no knowledge of the one he formerly confessed, severing the bond of intimacy with a vehement negation. Yet, nature itself rebukes the unnatural act of the apostle; as he completes his denial, the rooster—a creature of the morning and a herald of the light—sounds its cry. The irrational beast obeys its appointed time, while the rational man abdicates his appointed station.

**Verse 75**
**Greek Text**
και ε ο πετροϲ του ρηματοϲ ει οτι πριν αλεκτορα φωνη τριϲ απαρνηϲη με · και εξελθων εξω εκλαυϲεν πικρωϲ

**English Translation**
And Peter remembered the word spoken, that "Before a rooster crows, three times you will deny me"; and having gone out, he wept bitterly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Memory serves here as the agent of judgment and the beginning of restoration. The sound of the rooster awakens the dormant conscience, recalling the specific prediction that had been dismissed in pride. He remembers the word spoken, and this recollection shatters the hardness of his heart. He does not remain in the courtyard of denial but goes "out"—separating himself from the occasion of his fall. The bitterness of his weeping testifies to the sweetness of the love he had betrayed; it is a sorrow not of despair, like that of the traitor, but of a broken spirit seeking to wash away its stain.
