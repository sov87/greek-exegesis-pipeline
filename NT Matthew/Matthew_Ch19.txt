**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο οτε ε ο τουϲ λογουϲ τουτουϲ μετηρεν απο τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ και ηλ και ηλθεν ειϲ τα ορια τηϲ ιουδε ιουδαιαϲ περαν του ϊορ

**English Translation**
And it happened when [he finished] these words he departed from Galilee and he ca- and he came into the borders of Jude- of Judea beyond the Jor[dan]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The movement of the narrative follows the completion of the words. He departs from one region to enter the boundaries of another, crossing beyond the river. The text reiterates his coming, emphasizing the certainty of his arrival in the borders of Judea.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ηκο αυτω οχλοι πολλοι και εθεραπευϲεν αυ εκι :

**English Translation**
And followed him crowds many and he healed th[em] there

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitudes are drawn to follow him, seeking his presence. His power is demonstrated in that specific place where they gathered, as he provides healing to the crowds who attached themselves to him.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και ‾̷‾ προ προϲηλθον αυτω οι φαριϲεοι πιραζ πιραζ αυτον και λε ει εξεϲτ ἀ απολυϲε την γυ αυτου κατα παϲαν αιτιαν

**English Translation**
And ap- approached him the Pharisees test- test- him and say- if it is lawful to r- release the wi[fe] of him according to every cause

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisees approach not with a desire for truth but with an intent to test him. They seek to exploit the law, inquiring if a man may release his wife for any cause whatsoever, thereby looking for a license to sever the bond.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε αποκριθειϲ ειπεν ουκ ανε οτι ο ποι απ αρχηϲ · αρϲεν και θηλυ εποιηϲεν αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
But he answering said did you not read that the [one] mak[ing] from beginning male and female made them

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He refutes their inquiry by pointing to the reading of the ancient text. The order of creation is established by the Maker from the beginning, who formed them specifically as male and female, defining their nature before human custom arose.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν ενεκα τουτου κα τον και την και προϲκολλη τη γυνε γυναικι αυτου και εϲ οι δυο ειϲ ϲαρ μιαν

**English Translation**
And said on account of this lea- the and the and will be joined to the wif- wife of him and the two will be into fle[sh] one

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine pronouncement requires a leaving of the parents to adhere to the wife. This union transforms the two distinct individuals into one flesh, a unity that supersedes their former separate existence.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ωϲτε ου ειϲιν δυο αλλα μια ϲαρξ · ο ο ο ο ϲυνεζευξ ϲυνεζευξ α μη χωριζε

**English Translation**
So that not they are two but one flesh; what what what what yoked together yoked together m[an] let not separate

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They are no longer two but constitute a single fleshly reality. That which has been yoked together by a higher power must not be separated by man; the repetition of the yoking emphasizes the indissoluble nature of the bond.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
λεγουϲιν αυτω τι ουν μωϲηϲ μωϋϲηϲ μωϋϲηϲ ε δουνε βιβλιον αποϲταϲι και απολυϲε :

**English Translation**
They say to him why then Moses Moses Moses co- to give a scroll of divorce and to release

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They appeal repeatedly to the name of Moses to counter the teaching on unity. They view the giving of a scroll of divorce as an established command or right, seeking justification for release in the ancient lawgiver.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτοιϲ ο οτι μωϋϲηϲ προϲ τ τ ϲκληροκαρδιαν ϋμων επετρεψ επετρεψ ϋμιν απολυϲαι ταϲ γυναικαϲ ϋμων απ αρχηϲ δε ου γε ουτωϲ

**English Translation**
He says to them th- that Moses toward the the hardheartedness of you permitted permitted you to release the wives of you but from beginning not has it been thus

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Moses permitted the release of wives only because of their hardheartedness, a concession to human weakness rather than a divine ideal. This permission stands in contrast to the state from the beginning, which did not include such separation.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
λε δε ϋμιν οτι ο οϲ αν απολυϲη τ γυνεκα γυναικα αυτου μη επι πορνια και γα αλλην μοι

**English Translation**
But say to you that who whoever releases the wif- wife of him not upon fornication and mar- another commits adultery

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authoritative declaration asserts that releasing a wife for any reason other than fornication leads to sin. To marry another while the first bond persists is identified explicitly as committing adultery.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
λεγουϲιν αυτω οι μαθη ει ει ουτωϲ εϲτιν η αιτια του α α μετα τηϲ γυνεκοϲ γυναικοϲ ου ϲυμφερι γαμη ˙

**English Translation**
The disci[ples] say to him if if thus is the cause of the m- m[an] with the wif- wife it is not profitable to marry

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples realize the severity of the bond described. If the cause between a man and his wife is so binding and inescapable, they conclude that it is more profitable to avoid marriage altogether than to risk such an unbreakable obligation.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ειπεν αυ ου παντεϲ χωρουϲι τον λογ τουτον αλλ οιϲ δε

**English Translation**
But he said to th[em] not all receive the wor[d] this but to whom it is giv[en]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ability to accept this saying regarding celibacy is not universal. It is restricted to those to whom the capacity is given, indicating that this way of life is a specific gift rather than a general command for all.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ειϲιν γαρ ευνου οιτινεϲ εκ κοι εγεννη ουτωϲ · και ειϲιν ευνου οιτινεϲ ευνου ϋπο τ α α και ειϲιν ευνουχοι οιτι ευνουχιϲ εαυτουϲ δια την βαϲιλειαν των ο : ο δυναμενοϲ χω χωριτω :

**English Translation**
For there are eunuchs who from wom[b] were born thus; and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by the m- m[en] and there are eunuchs who made eunuchs themselves because of the kingdom of the h[eavens]: the [one] being able to recei- let him receive

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Three types of eunuchs are distinguished: those born so from the womb, those made so by men, and those who choose this state for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. This voluntary renunciation is a high calling, intended only for the one who has the power to receive it.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲηνεχθη αυτω πεδια ϊνα ταϲ χιραϲ επι αυτοιϲ και προϲ οι δε μα επετιμηϲ αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
Then children were brought to him, that [he might lay] the hands upon them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text presents a movement of intercession, where the "children" are carried toward the Holy One not for instruction, but for the tangible mystery of the "hands" and prayer. The disciples, abbreviated here in understanding as in the text, perceive an interruption where there is instead a consecration. They rebuke the bringing, yet the laying on of hands serves as the seal of divine favor upon the weak.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ αφετε τα πεδια και μη κωλυετε αυτα ελθιν προϲ εμε των γαρ τοιουτ εϲτιν η βαϲιλια τ ο

**English Translation**
But he said to them, "Permit the children and do not hinder them to come to me; for of such is the kingdom of the h[eavens]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "permit" dissolves the obstruction raised by human authority. The Lord identifies the "kingdom of the h[eavens]" not with the powerful who rebuke, but with the "such" who are brought. Access to Him is the defining characteristic of the kingdom; to hinder this approach is to misunderstand the very nature of His reign.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και επι ταϲ χιραϲ επ αυ επορευθη ε

**English Translation**
And having laid the hands upon them, he departed from th[ere].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The action is consummated in the touch; the "hands" confirm the word spoken previously. There is no further discourse recorded here, only the act of blessing followed by departure. He moves "from th[ere]," signifying that the work of blessing the lowly is a completed station of His journey, requiring no further justification than the act itself.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου ειϲ προϲελ αυτω ειπεν διδαϲκαλε τι αγα ποιηϲαϲ ζω αιωνιον κλη :

**English Translation**
And behold, one having approached him said, "Teacher, what good [thing] having done shall I inherit eternal life?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inquirer addresses Him as "Teacher," seeking a transactional knowledge: a specific "good" deed to be performed to secure an inheritance. The question reveals a mindset where "eternal life" is a wage for work "done," rather than a gift received like the children in the prior verses. He seeks to inherit through action.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ὁ ο δε ειπεν αυτω τι με ερωταϲ πε του αγαθου ειϲ εϲτιν ὁ ο αγαθοϲ ει δε θελιϲ ειϲ την ζωην ειϲελθιν τηρηϲον ταϲ εν :

**English Translation**
But [he] said to him, "Why do you ask me concerning the good? One is the good [One]. But if you wish to enter into the life, keep the commandments."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord redirects the inquiry from the definition of a good work to the identity of the "good [One]." There is no multiplicity of goods to be mastered, but a single Source to be acknowledged. Yet, the path to enter "the life" remains tethered to the covenant; he does not abolish the law but enforces it: "keep the commandments."

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ποιαϲ φηϲιν : ο δε ειπεν το ου φονευϲιϲ ου μοιχευϲιϲ ου κλεψειϲ ου ψευδομαρτυρηϲιϲ

**English Translation**
"Which ones?" he says. And he said, "The: You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord enumerates the prohibitions that guard the life of the neighbor. These commandments—against murder, adultery, theft, and false witness—form the boundary of righteousness in the social order. By citing "The" specific laws, He grounds the young man's vague desire for "good" in the concrete reality of restraining harm against others.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
τιμα τον και την και αγα τον πλη ϲου ωϲ ϲεαυ

**English Translation**
"Honor the [father] and the [mother], and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To the negative prohibitions, He adds the positive obligations. The articles "the" and "the" demand the honor of the progenitors, father and mother. The summit of this second table of the law is the command to "love the neighbor," using the self ("yourself") as the measure of that love. This fulfills the requirements of the earthly life.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτω ο νεανι παντα ταυ εφυλαξα εκ νεοτητοϲ μου τι ετι ϋϲτερω

**English Translation**
The young man says to him, "All these I kept from my youth; what do I still lack?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "young man" claims a perfect record of custody over the law "from youth." Yet, his question "what do I still lack?" exposes the insufficiency of legal observance to satisfy the soul. He possesses the commandments, yet feels a void; he recognizes that the inheritance of life requires something beyond the avoidance of sin.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο ει θελιϲ τελι γενεϲθε ειναι ϋπαγε πωληϲον ϲου τα ϋπαρχοντα και δοϲ πτωχοιϲ και εξειϲ εξετε θηϲαυρον ε και δευ ακολουθι μοι

**English Translation**
[He] said to him, "If you wish to become to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to poor [ones], and you will have treasure in [heavens]; and come, follow me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Perfection ("perfect") is not found in accumulation but in divestment. The command is threefold: go, sell, give. This exchange transmutes earthly "possessions" into "treasure in [heavens]." The awkward phrasing "become to be" suggests a transformation of state. Only after the hands are emptied can the invitation "follow me" be obeyed.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ο νεα απηλθεν λυπουμενοϲ ην γαρ εχων κτημα πολλα ˙

**English Translation**
But having heard, the young man went away grieving; for he was having many possessions.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word is heard but not kept. He departs "grieving," a sorrow born of an inability to let go. His identity is bound to "having many possessions," and this possession possesses him. He walks away from the "Teacher" he sought, choosing the weight of his property over the weight of glory.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ὁ ο δε ειπεν τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι πλουϲιοϲ δυ ειϲελευ ειϲ την βαϲι των ο ο

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] said to his disciples, "Amen I say to you that a rich man will with difficulty enter into the kingdom of the h[eavens]."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord pronounces a solemn "Amen" on the danger of wealth. The "rich man" faces a unique obstruction; the abundance of earthly means creates a scarcity of spiritual capacity. To "enter" becomes a matter of extreme difficulty ("with difficulty"), for the kingdom of the heavens has no space for the burdens of the earth.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
παλιν δε λεγω ϋ οτι ευκοπω εϲτιν καμη δια τρηματοϲ τρυπηματοϲ ραφιδοϲ ειϲελθιν η πλουϲιον ειϲ τ βαϲιλιαν του

**English Translation**
And again I say to you that it is easier for a camel to enter through the hole [or] eye of a needle than for a rich man into the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The comparison is absolute and crushing. The large beast, the "camel," cannot pass through the "hole" or "eye" of the needle. The doubling of the word for the opening emphasizes the narrowness. This physical impossibility mirrors the spiritual impossibility for the "rich man" to enter the "kingdom of [God]" while retaining his burden.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲαντεϲ δε δε οι μαθηται εξεπληϲ ϲφοδρα λεγ λεγ τιϲ αρα δυνατε ϲωθηνε

**English Translation**
Hearing however however the disciples were aston[ished] exceedingly say say who then is able to be saved

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The excessive astonishment of the disciples reveals the severity of the spiritual standard placed before them, for if the path to life is narrowed by the shedding of earthly burdens, who possesses the strength to walk it? The repetition of their speech marks the depth of their perturbation, as the human mind staggers when confronted with the impossibility of its own salvation through natural means. They ask not merely who is willing, but who retains the power or ability to be saved, acknowledging that such a feat transcends human capacity and requires a potency not found in flesh.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
εμβλεψαϲ δε ο ει αυτοιϲ παρα τουτο αδυνατον εϲτιν παρα δε δυνα παντα

**English Translation**
Looking at however the [one] said to them with this impossible is with however possible all

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gaze of the Lord pierces the confusion of the disciples, distinguishing the limitations of the created order from the boundless nature of the uncreated. The text locates impossibility "with this," implying the present state or the human condition, which cannot elevate itself beyond its own nature. Yet, the antithesis is absolute: "with however possible all." In this divine proximity, the barriers of necessity are dissolved, and that which is naturally obstructed becomes open, for the power that establishes reality is not bound by the constraints it imposes upon it.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
τοτε αποκριθειϲ ο πετροϲ ειπεν αυ ϊδου ημιϲ αφη παντα και ηκολουθηϲαμ ϲοι τι αρα εϲται η ·

**English Translation**
Then answering Peter said to him Behold we left all and followed you what then shall be [for] u[s]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter speaks as the representative of total abandonment, presenting the voluntary poverty of the apostles as a completed act. Having severed the tethers to the world, he inquires into the future state, seeking the specific portion reserved for those who have emptied their hands to grasp the Lord. The question is not one of mercenary greed but of existential placement; having become destitute in the visible realm, they ask what definition they now hold in the economy of the kingdom.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ αμην λεγω ϋμ ϋμ οτι ϋμιϲ οι ακολου μοι εν τη παλινγενεϲι οταν καθιϲη ο του α επι θρο δοξηϲ αυτου καθηϲεϲθε και αυ επι · · θρονουϲ κρινοντεϲ ταϲ φυλαϲ του

**English Translation**
The [one] however said to them Amen I say to you you that you the [ones] follow[ing] me in the regeneration when sits the [son] of m[an] upon thro[ne] of glory of him you shall sit also yo[u] upon thrones judging the tribes of [the]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise is anchored in the regeneration, the new birth of the cosmos, where the order of humility is inverted into an order of judgment. He who sits upon the throne of glory shares this session with those who followed him in his humiliation, transforming their earthly lack into judicial authority. They are not merely observers but participants in the final administration, seated upon thrones to judge the tribes, indicating that the governance of the future age is committed to those who forsook the governance of the present age.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και παϲ οϲτιϲ αφη αδελφουϲ η αδελφαϲ η π η μ η γυναικα η τεκνα η αγρουϲ ε η οικιαϲ ενεκα του εμου ο ˙ εκατον λημ και ζωην αι κληρονο

**English Translation**
And everyone who left brothers or sisters or f[ather] or m[other] or wife or children or fields o[r] or houses for sake of the my n[ame] hundred shall rec[eive] and life et[ernal] shall inher[it]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The catalogue of renunciation encompasses the deepest bonds of kinship and the security of property, all severed for the sake of the Name. The recompense is not merely equivalent but exponential, a hundredfold return that testifies to the superabundant generosity of the divine logic. Beyond this multiplication of blessings stands the inheritance of life eternal, distinguishing the temporary reward from the permanent possession, ensuring that the loss of finite relations secures an infinite relation.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
πολλοι δε εϲοντε εϲχατοι πρωτοι και πρωτοι εϲχατοι

**English Translation**
Many however shall be last first and first last

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great inversion that governs the kingdom, overthrowing human hierarchies and temporal precedence. Those who claim primacy by birth, rank, or early appearance are relegated to the end, while those who arrive last, stripped of worldly status, are elevated to the forefront. This decree warns against presumption and comforts the humble, establishing that final standing is determined not by the order of entry or earthly esteem, but by the divine election which reorders all things.
