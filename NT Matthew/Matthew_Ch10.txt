**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και προϲκαλεϲα τουϲ μα αυτου εδω αυτοιϲ εξου ακα ωϲτε εκ αυτα και θε παϲαν νοϲον και παϲαν μαλακιαν :

**English Translation**
And having called his disciples, he gave to them authority of unclean spirits, so as to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord summons the disciples not merely to instruct them but to invest them with power. He confers authority over unclean spirits to expel them, demonstrating that the spiritual dominion over darkness must precede the physical restoration of the body. The commission extends to every disease and every sickness, ensuring that no form of human infirmity remains outside the scope of this delegated grace.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
των δε αποϲτολων τα ο εϲτιν ταυ : πρωτοϲ ϲιμων ο λεγομενοϲ πετροϲ και ανδρεαϲ ο α αυτου · κ(αι) ϊακωβοϲ ο του ζε · και ϊω ο αδελφοϲ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Now the names of the apostles are these: first Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The catalogue of the apostles begins with pairs of brothers, sanctifying the bond of flesh by the higher bond of the spirit. Simon, distinguished as Peter, stands first, indicating a primacy of listing among equals in the mission. James and John, sons of Zebedee, follow, showing that the call of God frequently encompasses entire households in service to the truth.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
φιλιπποϲ και βαρθολομεοϲ θωμαϲ και μαθ ο τελωνηϲ ϊακωβοϲ ο του αλ κ(αι) θαδδαιοϲ

**English Translation**
Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The selection includes Matthew the tax collector, demonstrating that former occupations of ill repute do not bar a man from the highest holy office when he is called by the Word. By joining him with Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, James of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, the Lord weaves diverse origins into a single unified body of messengers, purifying their pasts through their present vocation.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
ϲιμων ο κανανι και ο ϊουδαϲ ο ϊ ο και παραδουϲ παραδιδουϲ παραδουϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed, was betraying, betrayed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Simon the Cananaean is listed alongside Judas Iscariot, whose description is marked by the terrible stuttering repetition of his betrayal. The text emphasises the act of handing him over, inscribing the tragedy of apostasy within the very roll of the chosen. The traitor stands among the elect, a warning that proximity to the Holy One does not guarantee fidelity if the heart is treacherous.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
τουτουϲ τουϲ α ο πα αυτοιϲ λεγ ειϲ οδον εθνων μη απελ και ειϲ πο ϲαμαριτων μη ειϲελθηται

**English Translation**
These [twelve] he charged, saying to them: Into a way of Gentiles do not go, and into a city of Samaritans do not enter;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The restriction of the mission guards the order of divine economy. The apostles are forbidden the way of Gentiles and the cities of Samaritans at this juncture, ensuring that the promises made to the fathers are fulfilled before the grace overflows to the nations. The command to abstain from these paths concentrates the light upon the children of the covenant before its eventual diffusion.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
πορευ δε μαλλον προϲ τα προβατα τα απολωλοτα οι ι

**English Translation**
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mission is directed specifically to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, acknowledging their covenant status and their present wandering. The Shepherd seeks those who have strayed within the fold before gathering those outside. This prioritisation affirms God's faithfulness to His ancient people, seeking their restoration above all else in this season of grace.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
πορευομε δε κηρυϲϲετε λεγοντεϲ οτι ηγ η βαϲιλια των ο

**English Translation**
And going, preach, saying that the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The content of the proclamation is the proximity of the kingdom of the heavens. This announcement requires movement, for the command is to preach while going. The drawing near of this reign signals the end of the time of shadows and the immediate presence of divine governance among men, demanding urgent preparation of the heart.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
αϲθε θεραπευ νεκρουϲ εγειρε λ̣ε̣π̣ρουϲ εγειρεται νεκρουϲ εγειρεται λεπρουϲ καθα δαιμονι εκβαλλετε δωρε ελαβετε δωρε δοτε

**English Translation**
Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons; freely ye received, freely give.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is absolute and overwhelming: sickness, death, leprosy, and demons must yield to the apostles' word. The text's emphatic repetition of raising the dead and cleansing lepers underscores the magnitude of the power granted. Since this authority is a gift received without price, it must be dispensed without commerce, preserving the grace of the miracle from the stain of greed.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
μη κτηϲη χρυϲον μη μηδε αργυρ μηδε χαλκον ειϲ ταϲ ζωναϲ

**English Translation**
Acquire not gold, nor silver, nor copper for your belts;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prohibition against gold, silver, and copper strikes at the root of reliance on earthly provision. The apostles must travel light, their belts empty of currency, trusting solely in the Providence that sends them. This poverty serves as a testimony that their power and authority are not purchased by human means but are divinely endowed and sustained.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
μη πηραν ειϲ οδον μηδε δυο χιτωναϲ μηδε ϋποδημα μηδε ραβδον αξιοϲ γαρ ο εργατηϲ τηϲ τροφηϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
Not a wallet for the way, nor two tunics, nor sandal, nor staff; for worthy is the worker of his food.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Further stripping them of defenses, the Lord forbids the wallet, the second tunic, the sandal, and even the staff. This total vulnerability enforces a dependence on the hospitality of those they serve. The worker is worthy of his food, implying that their sustenance will arise naturally from their labor, provided by those who receive the spiritual benefit of their presence.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ειϲ ην δ αν πολιν η κωμην ειϲελθη εξεταϲαται εν αυ τιϲ αξιοϲ εϲτ κακει μινατε εωϲ αν εξελθηται

**English Translation**
And into whatever city or village ye enter, inquire in it who is worthy; and there remain until ye go out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The apostles must discern the character of their hosts, inquiring for one who is worthy to receive the messengers of truth. Once a worthy house is found, they are to remain there without moving from house to house. This stability honours the host and prevents the appearance of seeking better comfort, anchoring the mission in a specific locus of peace within the community.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ει δε ειϲ την οικιαν αϲπα αυτην λεγ ειρηνη τω οι τουτω λεγοντεϲ ειρηνη τω οικω τουτω

**English Translation**
And entering into the house, greet it, saying: Peace to this house; saying: Peace to this house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The entry into the house is marked by a solemn greeting repeated for emphasis. The command to speak peace to the house conveys the tranquility of the kingdom to the dwelling. The repetition in the text amplifies the necessity of this utterance, establishing the apostolic presence as one that brings divine peace, transforming the home into a sanctuary of the mission.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και εαν μεν ῆ η οι αξια ελθατω η ϊρηνη επ αυ εαν δε μη η α η ϊρηνη ϋμ εφ υμαϲ επιϲτρα

**English Translation**
And if indeed the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peace is not a mere sentiment but a spiritual substance carried by the apostle, capable of resting upon a place or recoiling from it. The worthiness of the dwelling determines the reception of the gift, yet the authority of the giver remains undiminished by rejection. When the vessel is unfit, the blessing does not dissipate into the void but returns to its source, preserving the sanctity of the peace entrusted to the messenger.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ αν μη δεξηται ϋμαϲ μηδε ακουϲη τουϲ λογουϲ ϋμων εξερ εξω τηϲ οικιαϲ η πολεωϲ η κωμηϲ εκινηϲ εκτιναξατε τον κονιορτον εκ τ ποδων ϋμων

**English Translation**
And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, going out outside that house or city or village, shake off the dust from your feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rejection of the messenger constitutes a total severance of communion, marked by the shaking of dust. We are commanded to carry nothing from the unholy place, ensuring that not even the earth of the rebellious city clings to the feet of the faithful. This act testifies that the judgment of that house belongs solely to itself and does not adhere to the walk of those who proclaim the truth.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν ανεκτοτερον ε γη ϲοδομ και γη γομορρων εν ημερα κριϲεωϲ η τη πολι εκινη

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and the land of Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ancient lands of Sodom and Gomorrah faced fire for their depravity, yet a heavier sentence awaits those who spurn the immediate presence of the gospel. To reject the light when it is offered brings a condemnation surpassing that of sins committed in the darkness of passion. The day of judgment measures responsibility by the magnitude of the revelation that was despised.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ϊδου εγω αποϲτελ ϋμαϲ ωϲ προβα εν μεϲω λυκ γινεϲθε ουν φρο ωϲ ο οφιϲ οι οφιϲ και ακαιρεοι ωϲ αι περιϲτεραι

**English Translation**
Behold, I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves; be therefore wise as the serpent [the serpents] and innocent as the doves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord mandates a union of opposing virtues to survive the predation of the world. The disciple must possess the prudence of the serpent, guarding the head and discerning danger, while maintaining the simplicity of the dove, which harbors no bile. Wisdom without innocence becomes guile, and innocence without wisdom becomes folly; only their combination preserves the sheep amongst the wolves.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
προϲε δε απο των α παραδω γαρ ϋμαϲ ειϲ ϲυνεδρια και εν ταιϲ ϲυναγω αυτων μαϲτι ϋμαϲ

**English Translation**
But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The threat arises from organized humanity, where persecution is formalized within councils and synagogues. The scourging occurs within the very structures built for assembly and law, proving that institutional power is often turned against the truth. The disciple is warned that the instruments of religious and civil order will be wielded to inflict suffering upon the just.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και επι ηγεμοναϲ δε και βαϲιλιϲ α ενε εμου ειϲ μαρ αυτοιϲ κ(αι) τοιϲ εθνεϲιν

**English Translation**
And before governors also and kings you will be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The arraignment before earthly rulers serves a divine economy, transforming the courtroom into a pulpit for testimony. The faithful are dragged before governors and kings not merely to suffer, but to present the evidence of the truth to the highest powers and the nations. The trial itself is the ordained method by which the world hears the witness of the suffering servant.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ο δε παραδωϲ ϋμαϲ μη μεριμνη πωϲ η τι λα δοθηϲε γαρ ϋμιν εν ε τη ωρα τι λα

**English Translation**
But when they deliver you up, do not be anxious how or what you shall speak; for it shall be given to you in that hour what you shall speak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Anxiety regarding defense betrays a reliance on human rhetoric rather than divine provision. The prohibition against premeditation forces the disciple to depend entirely on the immediate gift of speech granted in the specific hour of trial. The words necessary for the testimony are not stored in the memory but are poured out at the instant of need.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ου γαρ ϋ εϲτε οι λαλο αλλα το του ϋμων το λαλουν εν ϋμ

**English Translation**
For it is not you who speak, but the [Spirit] of your [Father] that speaks in you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The agency of speech is transferred from the mortal instrument to the indwelling presence. It is not the intellect of the accused that formulates the defense, but the Spirit of the Father articulating the truth through the vessel. This divine possession ensures that the testimony given under duress is the direct voice of God addressing the world through His children.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
παραδωϲι δε α αδελφοϲ αδελφον ειϲ θανατον και τεκνον και επαναϲτηϲον τεκνα επι γο και θανατω αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father child; and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gospel acts as a sword that severs even the most primal bonds of kinship. The hatred of the truth penetrates the household, causing brother to betray brother and children to rise against their progenitors. Death becomes the tool of the family against its own members, revealing that spiritual allegiance provokes a hostility deeper than blood.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) κ(αι) ε μιϲουμε ϋπο παντ δια το ονομα μου ο δε ϋπομιναϲ ειϲ τελοϲ ουτοϲ ϲω

**English Translation**
And [you will be] hated by all because of my name; but the one who endures to the end, this one will be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Universal hatred is the inheritance of those who bear the name, for the world strikes at the name through the bearer. Salvation is not promised to the one who begins the race, but strictly to the one who sustains their confession until the very end. Endurance through the totality of rejection is the requisite mark of the saved.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
οταν δε διωκωϲιν ϋμαϲ εν τη πολι ταυτη φευγεται ειϲ την ετεραν αμην γαρ λεγω ϋ ου μη τελε ταϲ πολιϲ του εωϲ ου ελθη ο του

**English Translation**
But when they persecute you in this city, flee to the other; for amen I say to you, you will not finish the cities of [Israel] until the [Son] of [Man] comes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Flight is commanded as a strategic necessity to preserve the mission, not as an act of cowardice. The laborers must move from city to city, for the territory is vast and the time is short. The urgency of the proclamation is bound to the coming of the Son of Man, ensuring that the work remains incomplete and active until the moment of His arrival.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
ουκ ε μαθητηϲ ϋ τον διδαϲκα αυτου ουδε δουλοϲ ϋπερ τον αυτου

**English Translation**
A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his [lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hierarchy of suffering is established by the example of the Master. If the teacher and lord endures rejection, the disciple and slave must expect the same treatment. To seek exemption from the trials of the head is to claim a status superior to Him, but humility accepts the path of the Lord as the inevitable portion of the servant.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
αρκετ τω μαθητη ϊνα γε ωϲ ο διδαϲκα αυτου και ο δου ωϲ ο αυτου ει τον οικοδεϲποτ οικοδεϲποτ βεεζεβουλ επεκα επεκαλεϲαν ποϲω μαλλον τουϲ οι αυτου

**English Translation**
Sufficient for the disciple that he become as the teacher of him, and the slave as the [one] of him. If the master of the house, master of the house Beelzebul they called, they called, how much more those of the [house] of him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The perfection of the disciple lies in exact conformity to the teacher; to seek a fate superior to the master is pride, not discipleship. The repetition of the title "master of the house" underscores the authority which was maligned, while the stuttering repetition of the accusation "they called" betrays the obsessive malice of the accusers. If the head is branded with the name of a demon, the members of the household must expect no lighter judgment from the world.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
μη ουν φοβηθητε αυτουϲ ουδεν γαρ εϲτιν κεκαλυμ ο ουκ απο και κρυπτον ο ου γνωϲθηϲετε

**English Translation**
Therefore do not fear them; for nothing is covered which [shall] not [be] revealed, and hidden which shall not be known.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear is conquered by the certainty of revelation; the present concealment of truth is temporary and fragile. That which is "covered" implies an external action attempting to hide reality, but such covering is futile against the inevitable uncovering. We do not fear the temporary power of those who hide the truth, for the future holds a total exposure where all things hidden are made known.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ο λεγω ϋμιν εν τη ϲκοτια ειπατε εν τω φωτι και ο ειϲ το ουϲ ακουετε κη επι των δω

**English Translation**
What I say to you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what into the ear you hear, proclaim upon the housetops.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The darkness here is not of evil, but of privacy and preparation, where the word is first received. There is a necessary progression from the intimate whisper into the ear to the public proclamation upon the housetops. The disciple does not hoard the word in the secret place but is commanded to amplify what was given in silence into the full hearing of the public sphere.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και μη φο απο των α αποκτεννοντ το ϲωμα την δε ψυ μη δυναμε αποκτιναι φοβιϲθε δε μαλλ τον δυναμενον και την ψυχην και το ϲωμα απολεϲε γεεννη

**English Translation**
And do not fear from those killing the body, but the soul are not able to kill; but fear rather the one able both the soul and the body to destroy in Gehenna.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Man’s power is limited to the destruction of the clay vessel, the body; he cannot touch the substance of the soul. True fear must be directed only toward the Authority that holds jurisdiction over both the mortal frame and the immortal spirit. The destruction in Gehenna is the total loss of being, a catastrophe far surpassing the temporary severance of death inflicted by men.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ουχι δυο ϲτρουθια αϲϲαριου πωλειτε και εν ε αυτων ου πεϲι επι την γην αν του ϋμων

**English Translation**
Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And one of them shall not fall upon the earth without the [One] of you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The market price of sparrows is negligible, yet their existence is held within a divine oversight that permits not even a single fall without notice. The phrase "without the One of you" binds the fall of the sparrow directly to the One who possesses the disciples. Nothing in creation occurs outside this intimate and possessive knowledge.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ϋμων δε και αι τρι τηϲ κεφαληϲ παϲαι ηριθμημε ειϲιν

**English Translation**
But of you even the hairs of the head are all numbered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine providence is not merely general but rigorously specific, extending to the trivial numbering of hairs. If the parts of the body which are lost without pain are cataloged, how much more is the soul guarded? This numbering signifies a total ownership and a meticulous care that leaves no aspect of the disciple's life to chance.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
μη ουν φοβιϲθε πολλ ϲτρουθιων δια ϋμιϲ

**English Translation**
Therefore do not fear; you differ from many sparrows.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command against fear is grounded in a hierarchy of value established by the Creator. If the lesser vessel—the sparrow—is sustained, the greater vessel—the disciple—is assured. To fear is to deny this difference in value and to doubt the economy of God which weighs the worth of souls above many birds.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
παϲ ουν οϲτιϲ ομολο εν εμοι εμ των αν ομολογηϲω κα εν αυτω εμπρο του μου του εν ουρανοιϲ

**English Translation**
Everyone therefore who shall confess in me before men, I also will confess in him before the [One] of me who [is] in [the] heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The confession is mutual and binding; he who confesses "in" the Lord enters a union that the Lord reciprocates. It is not merely speaking *about* him, but standing *in* him before humanity. This earthly boldness secures a heavenly advocate, ensuring that the witness given among men is ratified before the One in the heavens.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
οϲτιϲ δ αν αρνηϲη με εμπροϲθεν των α αρνη καγω αυτ εμπροϲθεν του μου του εν ου

**English Translation**
But whoever denies me before men, I also will deny him before the [One] of me who [is] in [the] heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Denial is the breaking of the covenant of identity; to disown the Lord before the eyes of men is to be disowned in the court of heaven. The symmetry of justice requires that he who refuses to be known by the Truth on earth shall not be known by the Truth in the presence of the divine. The temporal safety gained by denial purchases eternal estrangement.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
μη νομι οτι ηλθον ϊ βαλιν επι την γην ουκ ηλθ βαλιν ϊρηνην αλλα μαχαιραν

**English Translation**
Do not think that I came to cast peace upon the earth; I came not to cast peace, but a sword.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Incarnation is an invasion that disrupts the false peace of a fallen order. The "sword" signifies the sharp, severing power of truth that cuts between the holy and the profane. We must not look for a tranquility that compromises with error, for the Lord casts a division that necessitates a choice.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ηλθ γαρ διχαϲαι α κατα του πατροϲ αυ και θυγατερα κατα τηϲ μητροϲ αυτηϲ και νυμφ κατα τηϲ πενθε αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
For I came to divide a man against the father of him, and a daughter against the mother of her, and a bride against the mother-in-law of her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sword of truth cuts through the deepest natural bonds of blood and kinship. The loyalty owed to the Creator supersedes the loyalty owed to the progenitor, creating a division where the natural order resists the divine. The family, often an idol of security, is shattered so that the soul may stand singly before its God.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και εχ του οι οικιακοι αυτου

**English Translation**
And enemies of the [man], the members of the household of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Proximity does not guarantee unity; often it ensures the sharpest conflict. When the light enters a house, those who prefer darkness become the enemies of the one who bears the light. The household, intended for shelter, becomes the arena of the fiercest spiritual trial, proving that the bond of faith is stronger and more contentious than the bond of flesh.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
ο φιλων η ϋπερ εμε ουκ εϲ μου αξιοϲ και ο φιλων ϋϊον η θυγατερα ϋπε εμε ουκ εϲτιν μου αξιοϲ

**English Translation**
The one loving [than] above me is not worthy of me; and the one loving son or daughter above me is not worthy of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The order of charity is established by the object of highest devotion. The text places the affection for the Divine above all natural kinship. By stating "loving above me," the Lord defines worthiness not by the absence of earthly love, but by the subordination of it. The bond of blood, represented here by son and daughter, is strong, yet the bond to the Master must supersede it; to invert this order is to forfeit the dignity of the disciple.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ ου λαμβανι τον ϲταυρον αυτου και ακολουθι ο μου ουκ ε μου αξιοϲ

**English Translation**
And who does not take his cross and follow [behind] me is not worthy of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Three acts constitute the faithful disciple: the taking up, the possession of the specific burden ("his cross"), and the movement in the proper direction ("behind me"). Mere suffering without following the Lord is of no merit; likewise, attempting to follow without the instrument of mortification is impossible. The worthiness is found only in the complete imitation of the Master’s path, encompassing both the burden and the obedience.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
ο ευρων την ψυχην αυτου απολεϲι αυτην κ(αι) ο απολεϲαϲ την ψυχην αυτου ενε εμου ευρηϲι αυτην

**English Translation**
The one finding his life will lose it, and the one losing his life on account of me will find it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great paradox of spiritual economy. To grasp the soul for the sake of temporal security is the very mechanism of its destruction. Conversely, the voluntary surrender of the soul, specifically qualified "on account of me," ensures its preservation. The life is not lost into a void, but is deposited into the hands of the Lord, where alone it can be truly found and restored.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
ο δεχομενοϲ ϋ εμε δεχετε ο δε κ(αι) ο εμε δεχομε δεχετε τον αποϲτιλαντα με

**English Translation**
The one receiving [you] receives me; and the one receiving me receives the one having sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is an unbroken unity in the reception of the Truth. Hospitality shown to the messenger does not terminate on the servant but ascends immediately to the Master, and through the Master to the Sender. The authority and presence of the Father are thus accessed through the reception of the Son, which is mediated through the reception of His disciples. No division exists in this hierarchy of grace.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
ο δεχομενοϲ προ ειϲ ονο προφητου μι προφητου λημψετε και ο δε δικαι ειϲ ονομα δικαιου μιϲθον δικεου λημ

**English Translation**
The one receiving a prophet into the name of a prophet a reward of a prophet will receive; and the one [receiving] a righteous man into the name of a righteous man a reward of a righteous man [will receive].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reward is contingent upon the recognition of the office. It is not merely the act of receiving a guest, but receiving him "into the name" of his calling—discerning the prophet as a prophet and the righteous as righteous. By identifying the grace present in the other, the host participates in the specific merit and spiritual wages assigned to that grace. The distinct orders of ministry carry distinct rewards, yet these are shared through the communion of hospitality.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ εαν πο ενα των μι τουτων πο ψυχρου μονον ειϲ ονο μαθητου αμην λεγω ϋμιν ου μη απολεϲη τον μιϲθον αυτου ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And whoever [gives to drink] one of these little ones [a cup] of cold only into the name of a disciple, amen I say to you, no not will he lose his reward.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The magnitude of the deed is subordinate to the motive. Even the simplest provision, "cold only," given to the humblest believer, "one of these little ones," secures an eternal consequence when done "into the name of a disciple." The Lord seals this promise with a double negative, ensuring that the remembrance of such an act can never be obliterated from the divine treasury. The intention sanctifies the gift, making the smallest service immutable in judgment.
