**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
ομοια γαρ εϲτιν η βαϲιλια των ουρα α οικοδεϲπο οϲτιϲ εξηλθ αμα πρωϊ μιϲθω εργαταϲ ειϲ τον αμπελωνα αυτου

**English Translation**
For the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, a house-master, who went out at daybreak to hire workers into his vineyard.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text establishes the sovereignty of the "house-master" (oikodespotēs) over the "kingdom of the heavens." He takes the initiative, going out at the very start of the day (*ama prōi*). The vineyard is identified specifically as his own; he seeks laborers not for their benefit primarily, but for the work within his domain. The calling is an act of going forth from the private dwelling to the public place to gather workers.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ϲυμφωνηϲαϲ δε μετα των εργα εκ δηναριου την ημεραν απε αυτουϲ ειϲ τον αμπελωνα αυτου

**English Translation**
And having agreed with the workers for a denarius the day, he sent them into his vineyard.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Order is established through a covenant: a specific agreement (*symphōnēsas*) binds the master and the laborers. The wage is defined clearly as a denarius for the day's duration. Once the covenant is made, the command follows immediately to send them into the place of labor. There is no ambiguity in this first engagement; work and reward are fixed by mutual consent.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθων πε τριτην ωραν ει αλλουϲ εϲτω εν τη αγορα αρ

**English Translation**
And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing in the marketplace idle.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The master returns to the world outside, the marketplace, at the third hour. He perceives the state of those not in the vineyard as "idle" (argous), meaning without work or effect. His gaze distinguishes those who are standing without purpose from those he has already sent to labor. The marketplace acts as a holding place for those not yet called into service.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και εκεινοιϲ ειπεν ϋπαγετε κ(αι) ϋμιϲ ειϲ τον αμ μου και ο εαν η δικεον δικαιον δω ϋμιν

**English Translation**
And to those he said, Go also ye into my vineyard, and whatever may be just, just, I will give to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "Go also ye" extends the scope of the labor. Here, there is no fixed sum agreed upon as before; instead, the promise rests on the character of the master. The text emphasizes the quality of the reward with a repetition, *dikeon dikaion* (just, just). The laborers must trust that the master will give what is inherently right, rather than relying on a pre-negotiated stipulation.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
οι δε απηλ παλιν δε εξελθ εξελθ περι εκτην και ενα ωραν εποιηϲ ωϲαυτωϲ

**English Translation**
And they went away. And again having gone out, gone out, about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Obedience is immediate: "they went away" into the work. The master’s persistence is marked by the repeated text "gone out, gone out" (*exelth exelth*). He returns at the sixth and ninth hours, repeating the same action. The calling is not a single event but a continuous activity of the master throughout the progression of the day, gathering at every stage.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
περι δε την ενδεκα εξελθων εξηλθεν ευρ ευρ αλλουϲ εϲτωταϲ και λεγει αυτοιϲ τι ωδε εϲτηκατε ολ ολ την ημεραν αργοι

**English Translation**
And about the eleventh, having gone out, he went out [and] found, found others standing, and says to them, Why here stand ye whole, whole the day idle?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
At the final hour, the urgency of the master is visible in the text's doubling: he "found, found" (*eur eur*) them. He confronts their inactivity with the question of why they have stood "whole, whole" (*ol ol*) the day idle. The repetition emphasizes the tragic totality of the wasted time. They have existed through the entire duration of the light without engaging in the work.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
λεγουϲιν αυτω οτι ουδιϲ ημαϲ εμιϲθωϲατο λεγει αυτοιϲ ϋπαγε και ϋμιϲ ειϲ τ αμπελωνα

**English Translation**
They say to him, Because no one hired us. He says to them, Go also ye into the vineyard.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The laborers plead a lack of invitation: "no one hired us." They stood idle not out of refusal, but out of neglect by others. The master accepts no delay; he commands them to enter the vineyard even at this late hour. The invitation "Go also ye" validates their capacity to work, regardless of how little time remains.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
οψιαϲ δε γενομε λεγι ο του αμπελωνοϲ τω επιτροπω αυτου καλεϲον τουϲ ερ και αποδοϲ τον μιϲθον αρξα απο των εϲχατων εωϲ τ τ πρωτων

**English Translation**
And evening having come, he of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workers and give the wage, beginning from the last until the first.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
With the arrival of evening, the work ceases. The authority is designated as "he of the vineyard." He commands the steward to execute a specific order of judgment: payment must begin from the "last" (*eschatōn*) and proceed to the "first" (*prōtōn*). This inversion of temporal priority signifies that the end of the work brings a new ordering of honor not based on duration.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και ελθ οι περι την εν ωραν ε ανα δηνα

**English Translation**
And having come, those about the eleventh hour received a denarius apiece.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Those who worked only the final hour appear first. They receive the full "denarius," the same sum promised to the early workers. The wage is given not as a calculation of minutes worked, but as a complete gift from the master. The shortness of their labor does not diminish the fullness of the master's provision.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ελθοντεϲ δε οι πρω ενομιϲαν ο πλιονα λημψ και ελαβον το ανα δηναριον και αυτοι

**English Translation**
And the first having come, supposed that they will receive more; and they themselves also received the denarius apiece.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "first" approach with a supposition (*enomisan*) generated by comparison. Seeing the mercy shown to the last, they calculate that justice requires an increase for themselves ("receive more"). However, they receive exactly what was covenanted: the denarius. Their expectation of surplus is met with the strict fulfillment of the agreement.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
λαβοντεϲ δε εγογγυζον κα του οικοδεϲπο

**English Translation**
And having received [it], they were grumbling against the house-master.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Reception of the wage turns to complaint. They grumble (*egonguzon*) specifically against the "house-master." The fulfillment of the contract becomes a source of bitterness because their eyes are fixed on the treatment of others rather than their own reward. They impugn the character of the one who hired them.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
λεγοντεϲ ου οι εϲχατοι μι ωραν εποιηϲ εποιηϲ και ϊϲουϲ εϊϲουϲ ϊϲουϲ αυτουϲ η εποιηϲαϲ τοιϲ βαϲταϲαϲι το βαροϲ τηϲ ημεραϲ και τ καυϲωνα

**English Translation**
Saying, These last did, did one hour, and thou madest them equal, equal, equal to us, who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The complaint is based on the disparity of suffering. They cite the "burden" and the "scorching heat" endured, contrasted with the single hour of the last. The text's intense repetition—"did, did" (*epoiēs epoiēs*) and "equal, equal, equal" (*isous eisous isous*)—reveals the depth of their scandal. They are offended that the master has established equality where they perceive a hierarchy of toil.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ε αυτων ειπεν ετερε ουχ αδικω ϲε ουχι δηναριου ϲυνεφωνηϲαϲ μοι

**English Translation**
But he answering said to one of them, Friend, I do not wrong thee: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The householder addresses the complaint by appealing to the binding nature of the covenant established at the start. He calls the laborer "Friend," maintaining a posture of goodwill even amidst the laborer's envy. Justice is defined here not by comparison with others, but by the faithful adherence to the specific agreement made between the master and the individual soul.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
αρον το ϲον και ϋπαγε θελω δε τουτω ω τω εϲχα δουναι ωϲ και ϲυ

**English Translation**
Take that which is thine and go thy way; but I will to give to this last one even as to thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command separates the laborer from his envy; he must take what is his and depart, for his eye cannot bear the master's generosity. The divine will ("I will") is the sole sufficient cause for the distribution of grace. The gift to the last is equal to the first, demonstrating that the reward of the Kingdom is a complete whole, not partitioned by the duration of human toil.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
η ουκ εξεϲτιν μοι ο θελω ποιη εν τοιϲ εμοιϲ η ο οφθαλμοϲ ϲου πονηροϲ εϲτιν οτι εγω αγαθοϲ ειμι

**English Translation**
Or is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs? Or is thine eye evil because I am good?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The master asserts his absolute sovereignty over his own possessions, which are the treasures of grace. The "evil eye" signifies the corruption of vision where one man's blessing becomes another man's grievance. The goodness of God is the standard against which human envy is judged; the wicked eye is blinded by the very light of the master's benevolence.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ εϲον οι εϲχατοι πρω και οι πρωτοι εϲχατοι

**English Translation**
Thus shall the last be first, and the first last.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This pronouncement overturns the temporal order of the world. In the economy of salvation, priority in time does not guarantee preeminence in honor. Those who come late to the vineyard, if they rely wholly on the master's goodness, precede those who rely on the merit of their long labor.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και αναβενων ο ιϲ ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα παρελαβεν τουϲ κατ ϊδιαν και εν τη οδω ειπεν αυ

**English Translation**
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took them apart privately, and on the way said to them,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ascent to Jerusalem is a deliberate movement toward the site of sacrifice. By taking them apart "privately," the Lord indicates that the mystery of the Passion is a revelation reserved for the initiated. The instruction given "on the way" signifies that understanding the cross is the necessary viaticum for the journey of discipleship.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ϊδου αναβενο ε ϊεροϲολυ και ο του αν παραδο τοιϲ αρχι και γραμ και κα αυτ αυτ ειϲ θανατον

**English Translation**
Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord foretells his passion with absolute clarity, identifying the specific agents of his condemnation—the religious authorities of the chief priests and scribes. The phrase "we go up" unites the disciples to his journey, yet the suffering belongs uniquely to the Son of Man. The legal condemnation by the guardians of the law exposes the blindness of the earthly hierarchy.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και παραδωϲουϲιν αυτον τοιϲ εθνε ειϲ το εμπε και μαϲτιγωϲε μαϲτιγωϲαι και ϲταυρωϲε κ(αι) κ(αι) τη τριτη ημερα εγερ ˙

**English Translation**
And they shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he shall be raised.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The betrayal extends from the Jewish leaders to the Gentiles, encompassing all humanity in the guilt of the Passion. The threefold suffering—mocking, scourging, crucifying—dismantles the Lord's dignity, physical integrity, and life. Yet, the prophecy culminates not in death, but in the certainty of the resurrection on the third day, which is the seal of his victory.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲηλθεν αυτω η μητηρ τ ϋϊων ζεβεδαιου μετα των ϋϊων αυτηϲ προϲκυνου και αιτουϲα τι παρ αυτου

**English Translation**
Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, worshipping and asking something from him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ambition often cloaks itself in the vestments of piety; the mother approaches with the posture of worship ("worshipping") to present a request for worldly status. She acts as the intercessor for her sons, seeking to secure their future glory before the cross has even been endured. The request is made "with her sons," implicating them in the desire for preeminence.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ει αυτη τι θε λεγι αυτω ειπε ϊνα καθιϲωϲιν ου οι δυο ϋϊοι μου ειϲ εκ δεξιων και ειϲ εξ ευωνυμ ϲου εν τη βαϲιλια ϲου

**English Translation**
And he said to her, What wilt thou? She saith to him, Say that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left, in thy kingdom.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mother requests a decree ("Say that") to bind the future Kingdom to her family's advantage. She seeks the positions of highest honor and governance—the right and left hands. Her faith is strong enough to believe in his Kingdom, yet carnal enough to misunderstand its nature as a court of earthly power.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθιϲ δε ο ειπεν ουκ οιδα τι αιτιϲθε δυνα πιειν το πο ο εγω μελ πινιν λεγου αυτω δυνα

**English Translation**
But he answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord redirects their gaze from the throne to the chalice. To ask for glory without understanding the necessity of suffering is to "know not what ye ask." The "cup" is the destiny of martyrdom and passion. The sons' response, "We are able," is a bold but naive profession; they affirm their strength before they have received the Spirit or witnessed the cross.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτοιϲ το μ ποτηριον μου πιεϲθε το δε κα εκ δεξιων μου και εξ ευω ουκ εϲ εμον δουνε αλλ οιϲ ητοιμα ϋπο του μου

**English Translation**
He saith to them, Ye shall drink indeed my cup; but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left, is not mine to give, but [it is for them] for whom it hath been prepared by my [Father].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He confirms their future martyrdom ("Ye shall drink"), ratifying their pledge with prophetic authority. However, he distinguishes between the participation in suffering, which is open to his followers, and the allocation of eternal rank, which is reserved by the preparation of the Father. The Son honors the Father's ordering of the Kingdom, refusing to usurp the divine decree regarding the seats of glory.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
και ακουϲαντεϲ ακουϲαντεϲ δε οι δεκα ηρξαντο αγανακτιν περι των δυο αδελφ

**English Translation**
And hearing [it], the ten began to be indignant concerning the two brothers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The indignation of the ten disciples reveals that they are afflicted with the same disease of ambition as the two brothers. They are angry not because the request was spiritual error, but because they fear being supplanted. The community is fractured when the pursuit of individual glory replaces the collective submission to the master's cup.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε προϲκαλε αυτουϲ ειπεν οιδατε ο οι αρχοντεϲ τ τ εθνων κατακυ αυτ αυτ και οι μεγαλοι κα κατεξουϲιαζουϲ αυτων

**English Translation**
But he having called them said: You know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord summons the disciples to a proximity that distinguishes them from the world. He identifies the "rulers of the nations" by their action: they "exercise lordship" (katakyrieuousin), a dominion that presses down from above. The repetition in the text ("over them... over them") emphasizes the suffocating weight of this worldly power. The "great ones" assert authority as a possession, but this is a model of governance the faithful are called to recognize only to reject.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
ουχ ου εϲτε εν ϋμ ϋμ αλλ οϲʼ εαν θελη εν ϋμιν μεγαϲ γενεϲθε εϲτε εϲτω ϋ διακονοϲ

**English Translation**
It is not so among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you, let him be your servant.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The phrase "not so" (ouch houtōs) creates an absolute severance between the kingdom of the earth and the kingdom of heaven. The stuttering of the text—"among you, among you"—intensifies the focus on the internal life of the community. True greatness is redefined not as ascent but as utility; the one who wishes to rise must descend into the role of the "servant" (diakonos), making his very existence a function of his brother's need.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ αν θελη ε εν ϋμιν εινε πρω εϲτε ϋμων δουλοϲ

**English Translation**
And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hierarchy is further inverted here: to be "first" requires a deeper degradation than merely being a servant. The "servant" renders aid, but the "slave" (doulos) surrenders agency. The ambition for primacy is granted only to those who accept total bondage to the welfare of the brethren. The text establishes that the highest station in the Church corresponds to the lowest condition in the social order.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ωϲπερ ο του αν ουκ ηλ διακονηθη αλλα διακο και δουνε την ψυχην αυτου λυτρον αντι πολ

**English Translation**
Just as the [Son] of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imperative of servitude is grounded in the divine archetype. The [Son] of Man enters human history not to receive the tribute due to a king, but to enact the ministry of a slave. The "ransom" (lytron) is the voluntary forfeiture of the "life" (psychēn), an exchange of the One for the "many" (pollōn). Service, therefore, is not merely ethical behavior but a participation in the sacrificial economy of redemption.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και εκπορευομε αυτων απο ϊεριχω ηκολουθη αυτω οχλοϲ πολυϲ

**English Translation**
And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Leaving the walled city of Jericho, the movement is outward, signifying the abandonment of static enclosure for the way of the cross. A "great crowd" follows, drawn by the power of his works, yet they remain a mass, distinct from the few who are called to understand the mystery of the ransom just proclaimed.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου δυο τυφλοι καθημενοι παρα την οδον ακουϲ ο οτι οτι παραγει εκρα λεγοντεϲ ελε ημαϲ ϋϊε δ

**English Translation**
And behold, two blind men sitting by the road, having heard that he is passing by, cried out saying: Have mercy on us, Son of David.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Deprived of sight, these two possess the clearer vision of faith. Sitting "by the road," they inhabit the margins of society, yet they rightly identify the passerby with the royal title "Son of David." Their cry is not for alms but for "mercy" (eleēson), a theological confession that acknowledges their own darkness and his sovereign power to illuminate.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ο δε οχλοϲ επετι αυτοιϲ ϊ ϲιωπηϲωϲιν οι δε πολλω μαλ εκραξαν εκραζαν εκραξαν λεγ λεγ ελεηϲον η δ

**English Translation**
But the crowd rebuked them that they might be silent; but they cried out much more, saying: Have mercy on us, [Son of] David.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitude seeks to silence the prayer of the afflicted, viewing it as a disorder. The text's agitation—"cried out, were crying out, cried out"—mirrors the relentless persistence of the blind men against the suppression of the world. Their desperation pierces through the rebuke; they will not cease to invoke the name of David's heir until the Mercy hears them.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και ϲταϲ ο εφω αυτουϲ και ειπεν τι θελετε ϊνα ποι ϋμιν

**English Translation**
And standing, he called them and said: What do you wish that I do for you?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord halts his journey, proving that the cry of the poor arrests the divine attention more effectively than the praise of the crowd. By asking "What do you wish," he restores dignity to those regarded as nothing, inviting them to articulate their desire. He compels them to confess their need, that the miracle may be an answer to specific faith rather than an imposition.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
λεγουϲ λεγουϲ αυτω ϊνα ανυγω οι οφθαλμοι ϋμων ημων

**English Translation**
They say to him: That our eyes might be opened.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The petition is purified of all secondary concerns; they ask only for light. The textual shift from "your" to "our" eyes betrays the urgency and confusion of the moment, resolving into a personal claim upon the miracle. They desire the opening of their eyes not merely to see the world, but to behold the Face of the one who speaks to them.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
ϲπλαγχνιϲθειϲ δε ὁ ηψατο των ο αυτου αυτων και ευθεωϲ ανε και ηκο αυτω

**English Translation**
And being moved with compassion, he touched their eyes; and immediately they looked up and followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The motivation of the Healer is "compassion" (splagchnistheis), a stirring of the depths. He does not heal from a distance but through contact, touching the organ of their darkness. The result is immediate: they receive sight ("looked up") and this physical restoration converts instantly into discipleship ("followed him"). To see truly is to walk behind him.
