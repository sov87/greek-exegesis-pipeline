**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
του δε γεννηθεντοϲ εν βηθλεεμʼ τηϲ ϊ εν ημερεϲ ημεραιϲ ηρωδου του του βαϲι ϊδο'υ μάγοι απο ανατολων παρεγενοντο ιϲ ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα ·

**English Translation**
Now when he was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The birth occurs in the humility of Bethlehem, yet within the temporal reign of Herod the king, establishing a contrast between the earthly ruler and the newborn divine presence. The arrival of magi from the east signifies that wisdom from afar is drawn to the true center of authority, seeking revelation in Jerusalem.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
λε · που εϲτιν ὁ τεχθειϲ βαϲιλευϲ των ϊουδαιων ι ειδομεν ιδομεν γαρ αυτου τον αϲτεραν αϲτερα εν τη α και ηλθο προϲκυνη αυτω : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Saying, Where is the born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and came to worship him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inquiry acknowledges a King who is "born," not made by men, challenging the legitimacy of established powers. The star acts as a heavenly witness, guiding the nations to offer worship, which is the proper response of creation to the Incarnation.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ο βαϲι ηρωδηϲ ετα και παϲα ϊ μετʼ αυ

**English Translation**
And King Herod having heard was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The news of a true King brings disturbance to the usurper, for worldly power rests on fear and control. That all Jerusalem is troubled with him shows how the spiritual state of the ruler affects the peace of the entire city.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυναγαγ πανταϲ τουϲ αρχι αρχι ϊερειϲ και γραμμα του λαου επυν παρ αυτ πο'υ ο γεννατε γενναται

**English Translation**
And having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where he is born.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herod utilizes the religious authorities not for devotion but to secure his own position. He seeks the location of the birth through the scriptures, turning the holy knowledge of the priests into intelligence for his jealousy.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ὁι δε εῖπαν αυτω αυτω ‾̷‾ εν βηθλεεμʼ τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ · ουτωϲ γαρ γεγραπται δια του προφητου · >

**English Translation**
And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea; for thus it is written through the prophet:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The answer is grounded in the written word, which stands as the final authority on the divine plan. The scribes possess the letter of the prophecy regarding Bethlehem, identifying the place of the Messiah without discerning the time of his arrival.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και ϲυ βηθλεεμ γη > ϊουδα ουδαμωϲ > ε ει εν τοιϲ > ηγεμοϲιν ϊουδα · > ε ου γαρ εξελευϲεται > η ὁϲτιϲ > ποιμανι ποιμανε'ι τον λα > μου τον ι ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And thou, Bethlehem, land of Judah, art by no means least among the governors of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth one who shall shepherd my people Israel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The seeming insignificance of the land is overturned by the greatness of the ruler who emerges from it. The true nature of this King is to shepherd the people, guiding them with pastoral care rather than dominating them with tyranny.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ηρωδηϲ λαθρα καλεϲαϲ τουϲ μαγουϲ ηκριβωϲεν παρ αυ τον χρονον του φαινομενου αϲτεροϲ ·

**English Translation**
Then Herod, having secretly called the magi, inquired exactly from them the time of the appearing star.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The king operates in secrecy, a mark of malice plotting against the light. His precise inquiry into the time of the star serves his intent to calculate the destruction of the child, using the sign of life as a measure for death.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
και πεμ αυτουϲ ειϲ βη εῖπεν πο εξετα ακριβωϲ πε του πεδιου · επ δε ἑύρητε απαγγι μοι · ὁπωϲ κα ελθων προϲ αυτω ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, Go search exactly concerning the child; and when ye have found, report to me, so that I also coming may [go] to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Deceit clothes itself in the language of piety, as the king pretends a desire to approach the child. The command to report back is a trap, attempting to make the innocent worshippers accomplices in his murderous design.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ὁι δε ακουϲαντεϲ του βαϲιλεωϲ ε · και ϊδου ὁ αϲτηρ ὁν ϊ εῖδον εν τη ανατο προῆγεν προηγον αυτουϲ ἑωϲ ελθων εϲτα επανω ὁυ ἠν το παιδιον ·

**English Translation**
And they, having heard the king, went; and behold, the star which they saw in the east went before them, until coming it stood over where the child was.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Leaving the presence of the earthly king, they are once again guided by the heavenly sign. The star resumes its leadership to pinpoint the specific location of the child, showing that divine guidance surpasses human directions.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ϊδον δε τον αϲτεραν αϲτερα εχαρηϲαν χαραν μεγαλην ϲφοδρα · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reappearance of the star brings immense gladness, confirming their journey was not in vain. This great joy is the fruit of faith rewarded, as the light leads them to the very presence of the object of their hope.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντεϲ ειϲ την οικιαν ϊδον εῖδον το παιδιον μετα μαριαϲ τηϲ μητροϲ αυτου · και πεϲον προϲεκυνηϲαν αυτω · και ανοιξαν τουϲ θηϲαυρουϲ ἁυτων προϲηνεγʼ αυτω δωρα χρυϲον · και λιβαν · και ϲμυρναν ·

**English Translation**
And coming into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshipped him; and opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They find the King in a humble house with Mary his mother, yet they offer the tribute of nations. The gifts signify his identity: gold for his royalty, frankincense for his divinity, and myrrh for the mortality he assumed for our sake.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και χρηματιϲθεντεϲ κατ ὁναρ μη ανα προϲ ηρω διʼ άλʼληϲ ὁδου ανεχωρηϲαν ειϲ την εαυτων χω χωραν αὑτων · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And being warned by dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country through another way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine intervention protects the worshippers from becoming tools of the tyrant. Having encountered the Christ, their path is altered; they cannot return by the way they came, symbolizing the change of life after meeting the Lord.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
αναχωρηϲαντ δε αυτων ϊδου αγ φαινε κατʼ οναρ τω ϊ ˙ λεγων · εγερ παραλαβε το παιδιον και την μητερα ἀυτου · και φευγε ειϲ αιγυπτ αιγυπτ · και ϊϲθι εκει ἑωϲ αν έιπω ϲοι · μελʼ γαρ ηρωδηϲ ζητιν το πεδιον του απολεϲε αυτο · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And they having departed, behold, an angel appears by dream to Joseph, saying: Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell thee; for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The safety of the Savior is entrusted to Joseph's guardianship under angelic command. The flight into Egypt shields the child from the immediate wrath of Herod, utilizing a foreign land as a sanctuary against domestic persecution.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε εγερθιϲ παρε το πεδιον και την μητερα ἁυτου νυκτοϲ νυκτο και ανεχωρηϲεν ει αιγυπτον ·

**English Translation**
And he, having arisen, took the child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Joseph responds with immediate obedience, moving under the cover of night to ensure the child's protection. This departure marks the beginning of the Lord's sojourn among the nations, fleeing the darkness of human malice.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και εκι εωϲ τηϲ τελευ ἡρωδου ϊνα πληρωθῆ το ρηθ ϋπο δια του > προ λεγοντοϲ > εξ αιγυπτου > εκα τον ὑιον μου ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And he was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt I called my son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The exile in Egypt is not merely a strategy for survival but a fulfillment of prophecy. As Israel was called out of Egypt, so the Son completes this pattern, embodying the history of the people he came to save.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ηρωδηϲ ϊδ ὁτι ενεπεχθη των μαγων εθυμωθη λειαν λῖαν και αποϲτιλαϲ α πανταϲ τουϲ παιδαϲ τουϲ εν βηθλεεμ · και εν πᾶϲι τοιϲ ὁρὶοιϲ ἀυτηϲ απο διετουϲ · και κατωτερω · κα τον χρονον ὁν ηκριβωϲεν πα των μαγων · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked by the magi, was exceedingly wroth; and having sent, he slew all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time which he inquired exactly from the magi.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The wrath of the king results in the slaughter of the innocent, revealing the deadly consequence of pride. He casts a wide net based on the time of the star, destroying many lives in a futile attempt to eliminate the one true King.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
τοτε επληρωθη το ρηθεν δια ϊερε του προφη λεγοντοϲ >

**English Translation**
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tragedy of the slaughter is encompassed by the prophetic word. The scripture foresaw this sorrow, indicating that the suffering of the innocents is not outside the foreknowledge of God.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
φωνη εν ραμα > η · κλαυθμοϲ > και οδυρμοϲ πολυϲ · > ραχηλ · κλαιουϲα τα > τεκνα ἁυτηϲ · και > ουκʼ ηθελεν > παρα ὁτι > ου ειϲιν ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
A voice was heard in Rama, weeping and much mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Rachel, the mother of the tribes, is personified in the grief of the mothers of Bethlehem. Her refusal to be comforted testifies to the depth of the loss, marking the arrival of the Messiah with the tears of Israel.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
τελευτηϲαντοϲ δε του ηρωδου · ϊ αγγελοϲ φαινεται κατʼ οναρ τω ϊωϲηφʼ εν αι

**English Translation**
But Herod having died, behold, an angel appears by dream to Joseph in Egypt.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The death of the persecutor signals the time for return. The angel's appearance in Egypt shows that God's guidance is continuous, orchestrating the movements of the holy family according to the removal of earthly threats.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
λεγων : ε παραλαβε το παιδιον και τ ἀυτου · και πο ειϲ γην · τεθνηκαϲιν γαρ ὁι ζητουντεϲ την ψυχην του πεδιου · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Saying, Arise, take the child and his mother and go into the land; for they are dead who were seeking the life of the child.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to return is issued because the seekers of the child's life have perished. The plural "they" suggests that the enmity was shared by others with Herod, but their power is broken by death.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε εγερθιϲ παρε το παιδιον · και την αυτου · και ειϲῆλθεν ειϲ γην ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And he, having arisen, took the child and his mother and entered into the land.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Joseph acts again with promptness, restoring the child to his heritage. The entry "into the land" signifies the end of the exile and the resumption of the child's presence among the people he is to shepherd.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
άκουϲαϲ δε ὁτι αρ βαϲιλευει τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ · αντι του αυτου ηρω · εφοβηθη εκει απελθειν · χρημα δε κατʼ οναρ ανεχωρηϲεν ειϲ τα μερη τηϲ γαλι ·

**English Translation**
But having heard that Archelaus reigns over Judea instead of his father Herod, he feared to go there; and being warned by dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The succession of worldly power perpetuates fear, as the son reigns in the father's stead. Divine warning redirects the family to Galilee, ensuring safety by moving them away from the center of political danger in Judea.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και ελθων κατʼώκηϲεν ειϲ πολιν λεγομεν ναζαρετʼ · ὁπωϲ πληρωθη το ρηθ δια υπο των προφητ > ὁτι ναζωρᾶιοϲ > κληθηϲεται : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And coming he dwelt in a city called Nazareth; so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets: That he shall be called a Nazarene.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The settlement in Nazareth is the final step in this chapter of guidance, fulfilling the prophetic designation. The name "Nazarene" identifies the child with a specific place of humility, aligning his earthly identity with the words of the prophets.
