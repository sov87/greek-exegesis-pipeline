**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και οτε ηγγιϲαν ε ϊεροϲολυμα και ηλθεν ηλθον ειϲ βηθφα προϲ το οροϲ τ τ ελεων τοτε ο απεϲτιλεν · · μαθηταϲ

**English Translation**
And when they drew near to Ierosolyma and came came into Bethpha[ge] towards the mountain of the of the Olives, then the [One] sent disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred text stammers "came came," marking the arrival not merely as a physical step but as a definitive spiritual event; the Lord approaches the city of peace which knows no peace. He moves towards the "mountain of the of the Olives," the place of oil and anointing, preparing to pour Himself out for the world. "The [One]" acts with unnamed authority, sending the disciples as extensions of His will to bridge the mount of prayer with the city of sacrifice.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
λεγ λεγ αυτοιϲ πορευεϲθε ειϲ τ τ κωμην την κατε ϋμων και ευθυϲ ευρηϲετε ονον δεδεμεν δεδεμεν και πωλον μετ ︴ αυ λυϲαντεϲ αγα μοι

**English Translation**
Saying saying to them: Go into the the village the [one] opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied tied and a foal with her; loosing [them], lead [them] to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "saying saying" doubles the force of the divine word, ensuring obedience. The donkey is found "tied tied," signifying the profound bondage of the creature under the old law and the weight of sin, unable to move until the Master commands its release. The instruction to "lead [them] to me" reveals that true liberty consists not in wandering without a yoke, but in being brought to the service of the Lord who looses the captives.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και εαν τιϲ ειπη τι · ε οτι ο αυτου χριαν εχει ευθυϲ δε αποϲτελι αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And if anyone says anything, say that the [Lord] has need of them; and immediately he will send them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The supreme claim of the Creator over His creation is voiced in the phrase "the [Lord] has need"; this necessity overrides all earthly ownership. The response of the owner is immediate, not due to persuasion but due to the power of the Word that governs the heart. Thus, the text shows that all temporal goods are held in stewardship, waiting to be surrendered the moment the Master calls for their use in His economy.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
τουτο δε γεγονεν ϊνα πληρωθη το ρηθεν δια του προ λεγοντοϲ

**English Translation**
Now this happened in order that the [word] spoken through the pro[phet] might be fulfilled, saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
History serves prophecy; the event "happened" specifically to fill the vessel of the ancient word. The "pro[phet]" is the instrument through whom the Spirit spoke, but the fulfillment belongs to the God who orchestrates time. The loosing of the colt is therefore not a chance occurrence but a necessary act to complete the pattern of Scripture, binding the present moment to the eternal will.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ειπατε τη θυγατρι ϲιων > ϊδου ο βαϲιλευϲ ϲου > ερχετε ϲοι πραϋϲ > και επιβεβηκωϲ > επι ονον και επι > πωλον ϋϊον ϋϊον > ϋπο ζυγιου

**English Translation**
Say to the daughter of Sion: Behold, your King comes to you meek and mounted upon a donkey and upon a foal, son son of a beast of burden.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The King approaches the "daughter of Sion" not with the violence of armies but "meek," subverting the pride of the world. The emphasis on the foal as "son son" of the yoke-bearer stresses its humble generation, born to service and labor. By mounting such a beast, the King sanctifies the lowly and lifts the burden from the daughter of Sion, taking the yoke upon Himself to carry her into His kingdom.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
πορευθεντεϲ δε οι μαθηται και ποι καθωϲ προϲεταξεν αυτοιϲ ο

**English Translation**
And the disciples having gone and do[ing] just as the [Jesus] commanded them,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True discipleship is defined by "do[ing] just as" the Master ordered, without deviation or addition. The text identifies the source of the command simply as "the [Jesus]," centering all authority in His person. Their movement is a procession of obedience, demonstrating that the execution of the divine will requires a complete alignment of the servant's action with the Lord's word.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ηγαγον την ο και τον πω και επεθηκ επεθηκ επ αυτων τα ϊμα αυτων και εκαθιϲαν επεκαθιϲαν επανω επ αυτ αυτ

**English Translation**
And they led the donkey and the foal, and put upon put upon on them their garments, and they sat upon sat upon above on them them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition "put upon put upon" and "sat upon sat upon" conveys the intensity of the honor paid and the fullness of the enthronement. The disciples strip themselves of their own "garments" to adorn the beasts, confessing that their own glory serves only as a saddle for the Christ. The doubled "on them them" suggests a comprehensive covering, where the unclean animals are clothed in the vestments of the saints to bear the Holy One.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ο δε πλιϲτοϲ οχλοϲ εϲτρωϲαν εαυτ τα ϊματια εν τη οδω αλλοι δε εκοπτ κλαδουϲ απο τ δενδρων και εϲ εϲτρωννυον εν τη οδω

**English Translation**
But the very many crowd spread their own garments in the way, and others were cut[ting] branches from the trees and spread spread [them] in the way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "very many crowd" participates in a liturgy of self-emptying, laying "their own garments" in the dust to prepare the royal path. By cutting branches from the trees and "spread[ing] spread[ing]" them, they unite the creation with human artifice in homage to the Creator. The way is thus carpeted with the sacrifice of their possessions and the fruit of the earth, acknowledging that He is Lord over both nature and humanity.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
οι δε οχλοι οι προ αυτον κ(αι) οι ακολουθουν εκραζον λεγ λεγ ωϲαννα τω δ ευλογημενοϲ ο ερ εν ονο ωϲαννα τοιϲ ϋψιϲτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And the crowds the [ones] preceding him and the [ones] following were crying out, saying saying: Hosanna to the D[avid]! Blessed [is] the [one] com[ing] in name! Hosanna in the highest!

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The faithful of all times, those "preceding" in the old covenant and those "following" in the new, surround the Christ who is the center of history. They cry "to the D[avid]," confessing the fulfillment of the royal line, and their "saying saying" fills the air with the recognition of His divine mission. He comes "in name," bearing the full authority of the Father, and their praise ascends to the "highest," linking the dust of the road with the throne of heaven.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντοϲ ειϲελθοντοϲ αυ ϊϲ ϊεροϲολυμα εϲιϲθη παϲα η πολιϲ λεγουϲα τιϲ εϲτιν ουτοϲ

**English Translation**
And of him coming entering, Jesus, [into] Ierosolyma, all the city was shaken, saying: Who is this?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The entry of Jesus causes a spiritual earthquake, for "all the city was shaken" by the presence of its true King. The repetition "coming entering" emphasizes the penetration of the divine into the human city, disturbing its complacency. The question "Who is this?" reveals the blindness of Ierosolyma; while the crowds proclaim Him, the city itself remains in ignorance, trembling before a mystery it cannot comprehend.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
οι δε οχλοι ελεγ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο προ ο απο να τηϲ γαλιλε

**English Translation**
But the crowds were say[ing]: This is the pro[phet], the [one] from Na[zareth] of the Galile[e].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowds answer the city's ignorance by testifying to the scandal of the Incarnation: the "pro[phet]" is "from Na[zareth]." They do not hide His humble origins in "Galile[e]" but proclaim them, understanding that God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise. This confession anchors the glory of the entry in the humility of His earthly dwelling, affirming Him as the one promised to Moses.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και ειϲηλθεν ὁ ειϲ το ϊερον και εξεβα πανταϲ τουϲ πωλουνταϲ και αγοραζονταϲ εν τω ϊερω και ταϲ τρα των κολλυ κατεϲτρε και ταϲ καθε των πωλο πωλο ταϲ περιϲτε

**English Translation**
And the [Jesus] entered into the temple and cast out all the [ones] selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of the [ones] selling selling the doves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He enters "the temple" as the rightful Heir inspecting His house, and His first act is purification. He casts out those "selling and buying," putting an end to the transaction of religion; the reduplication "selling selling" exposes the ceaseless greed that had infested the holy place. By overturning the "seats," He dethrones the idols of commerce to restore the seat of mercy, clearing the space for the doves of the Spirit rather than the doves of trade.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και λεγι αυτοιϲ γεγραπται ο οικοϲ μου οικοϲ προϲευ κληθηϲετε ϋ δε αυτον ποι ϲπηλεον λη

**English Translation**
And he says to them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer; but you make it a cave of robbers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord distinguishes between the divine designation of the sanctuary and its human degradation. What is written establishes the house for the spiritual labor of prayer, yet human avarice transforms it into a hiding place for thieves. He condemns the distortion of the holy place from a site of supplication to a den of iniquity.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και προϲηλθον προϲελθοντεϲ προϲηλθον αυτω τυφλοι και χωλοι εν τω ϊερω και εθεραπευϲεν αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
And there approached, approaching, there approached him blind and lame in the temple, and he healed them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reiterates the approach threefold, emphasizing the unceasing movement of the suffering toward the source of life. In the very temple where commerce was cast out, the blind and the lame find restoration. The purity of the house is vindicated not by trade, but by the healing of the afflicted.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ϊδοντεϲ δε οι αρχι και οι γραμμα τα θαυμαϲια α ε και τουϲ παιδαϲ τουϲ κραζ εν τω ϊερω και λεγονταϲ ωϲαν τω ϋϊω η

**English Translation**
But seeing, the chief priests and the scribes, the wonders which he did, and the children crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son H...,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The leaders behold the miracles and hear the acclamation of the children yet are stirred to indignation. While the learned reject him, the simple children recognize the Son, crying out in the holy place. The abbreviated cry "to the Son H..." marks the specific object of their praise, which the priests refuse to acknowledge.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και ειπαν αυτω ακου τι ουτοι λεγουϲ λεγουϲ ο δε λεγι αυτοιϲ ναι ουδεποτε α > εκ ϲτοματοϲ > νηπι και > θηλαζον κατηρτιϲω εν αιν

**English Translation**
And they said to him, Do you hear what these say, say? But he says to them, Yes; did you never [read], Out of the mouth of infants and suckling ones you perfected praise?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He rebukes the ignorance of the learned by pointing to the perfection of praise found in the weak. The repetition of "say, say" underscores the leaders' annoyance, but the Lord affirms that true praise is prepared by God in the mouths of infants. Divine truth is often hidden from the wise and revealed to the nursing child.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
και καταλιπων αυ εξηλθεν εξω τηϲ πολεωϲ ειϲ βη και ηϋλιϲ εκει

**English Translation**
And leaving them he went forth outside the city into Bethany and lodged there.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He withdraws from the confrontation in the city to find rest in Bethany. This departure signifies a judgment of silence against those who refused the testimony of the children. The holy one seeks lodging away from the turmoil of the unbelieving metropolis.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
πρωϊ πρωϊαϲ δε επαναγαγ επαναγ ειϲ την πολιν επι

**English Translation**
But in the morning, of the morning, returning, returning into the city, he hungered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord experiences the frailty of the flesh, hungering as he returns to his work. The double mention of the morning and the return highlights his persistence in seeking the city despite its rejection. His physical hunger mirrors his spiritual desire for fruit from his people.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδων ϲυ μιαν επι τηϲ οδου ηλθεν επ αυ και ουδεν ευρεν εν εν αυτη ει μη φυλλα μονον και λεγει αυτη μηκετι εκ ϲου καρποϲ γενοιτο ειϲ τον αιωνα και εξηρανθη παρα η ϲυκη

**English Translation**
And seeing one fig tree on the way, he came upon it and found nothing in, in it, except leaves only; and he says to it, No more from you let fruit be forever. And the fig tree withered immediately.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tree, possessing leaves but lacking fruit, serves as a figure of the hypocritical city. The judgment is absolute and eternal, stripping away the deceptive appearance of life. The immediate withering demonstrates the power of his word to expose and judge barrenness.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδοντεϲ οι μα εθαυμαϲαν λεγοντεϲ πωϲ πα εξηραν η ϲυκη

**English Translation**
And seeing, the disciples marveled, saying, How did the fig tree wither immediately?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples are seized with wonder not merely at the judgment, but at its swiftness. They observe the sudden collapse of that which appeared vibrant. Their question reveals a developing understanding of the authority that commands nature itself.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ειπεν αυτοιϲ αμ αμ λεγω ϋμιν εαν ε πιϲτιν και μη διακριθητε ου μο το τηϲ ϲυκηϲ ποιηϲετε αλλα κ κ τω ορι τουτω ειπη αρθητι και βληθη ειϲ την θαλαϲϲ θαλαϲϲ γενηϲετε

**English Translation**
And answering, he said to them, Amen, Amen I say to you, If you have faith and do not doubt, not only the thing of the fig tree shall you do, but also, also if you say to this mountain, Be lifted up and be cast into the sea, sea, it shall happen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He elevates their minds from the withered tree to the omnipotence of faith. The repetition of "Amen" and "also" reinforces the certainty of the promise. Faith that does not waver has the power to uproot mountains and cast them into the depths, surpassing even the judgment of the tree.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και παν οϲα αν αιτηϲη εν τη προϲευχη πιϲτευοντεϲ λημ

**English Translation**
And all things whatsoever you ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The breadth of the promise is boundless, encompassed only by the necessity of faith. Prayer is the vessel, and belief is the condition for reception. He assures that the faithful request is never made in vain but secures what is asked.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντοϲ αυτου ειϲ το ϊερον προϲηλθον αυτω διδαϲκοντι οι αρ και οι πρε του λαου λεγοντεϲ εν ποι εξουϲια ταυτα ποιειϲ και τιϲ ϲοι εδωκεν την εξου ταυτην

**English Translation**
And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him as he was teaching, saying, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authorities of the people challenge the Teacher within the temple, demanding credentials for his works. They do not deny the deeds but question the source of his right to perform them. It is an interrogation born of threatened power rather than a search for truth.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ειπεν αυτοιϲ ε ϋμαϲ και εγω λογον ενα ο εαν ειπητε μοι και εγω ϋμιν ερω εν ποια εξουϲια ταυτα ποιω

**English Translation**
And answering, he said to them, I will ask you, even I, one word, which if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He meets their challenge with a counter-question, establishing his own authority to examine them. By demanding an answer from them first, he exposes their inability to judge spiritual matters. He conditions the revelation of his authority upon their willingness to speak the truth.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
το βαπτιϲμα το ϊω ποθεν η ην ε ουρανου η εξ αν οι δε διελογιζοντο παρ εαυτοιϲ λεγ εαν ειπωμ εξ ουρανου ερει η δια τι ουν ου επιϲτευϲατε αυ

**English Translation**
The baptism of John, whence was it? From heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation forces the conscience to discern the origin of authority. Their reasoning reveals a heart not seeking truth but avoiding entrapment; they fear the charge of unbelief not because they repent, but because they cannot answer the heavenly claim of John without condemning their own inaction.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε ειπωμεν εξ α φοβου τον οχλον παντεϲ γαρ ωϲ προ εχουϲι τ

**English Translation**
But if we say, From m[en], we fear the crowd; for all hold [John] as a pro[phet].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear of the crowd silences the confession of their true thought. They are enslaved by the opinion of the many, holding the prophet in regard only insofar as the people do, proving they are followers of men rather than discerners of spirits.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθεντεϲ τω ειπαν ουκ οι εφη αυτοιϲ ο ουδε εγω λε ϋμιν εν ποι εξουϲια ταυτα ποι

**English Translation**
And answering [Him] they said, We know not. He said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They plead ignorance to escape judgment, but this feigned nescience is their judgment. He refuses to cast the pearl of His authority before those who willfully deny the witness already given; he who rejects the herald cannot receive the King.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
τι δε ϋμιν δοκει α ειχεν τεκνα κ(αι) προϲελθων τω πρωτω ειπεν τε ϲη εργαζου τω αμπελωνι

**English Translation**
But what think ye? A [man] had children; and coming to the first he said, Child, today work in the vineyard.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The father approaches with a command that is both immediate and intimate, addressing him as "Child." The call to labor in the vineyard is the test of sonship, requiring exertion "today," for the time of work is present and urgent.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ει ου θελω ϋϲ δε μεταμελη απηλθεν

**English Translation**
And he answering said, I will not; but afterwards repenting he went.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The initial rebellion of the will serves to highlight the power of subsequent repentance. The son's action in going to the vineyard validates his obedience more than fair words, showing that the turning of the heart corrects the error of the lips.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
προϲελθων δε τω ετερω δευτερω ειπεν ωϲ ο δε αποκριθιϲ ειπεν εγω και ουκ απηλθεν

**English Translation**
And coming to the other second he said likewise. And he answering said, I; and went not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prompt verbal assent—"I"—is a deception. This son honors the father with his mouth but denies him in deed; his barren profession is a greater slight than the first son's honest refusal, for he clothes disobedience in the garment of piety.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
τιϲ εκ των εποιηϲ το θελημα του λεγουϲιν ο πρωτοϲ λεγι αυτοιϲ ο α λεγω ϋμιν οτι οι τελωνε τελωναι και αι πορναι προαγουϲ προαγουϲ ϋμαϲ ειϲ την βαϲι του

**English Translation**
Which of the [two] did the will of the [father]? They say, The first. [He] saith to them, Verily I say to you, that the publicans and the harlots go before you into the kingdom of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The will of the father is accomplished by those who turn from sin, not those who presume upon their station. The publicans and harlots, through repentance, seize the kingdom which the self-righteous lose, proving that grace is found by the contrite heart rather than the proud confession.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
ηλθεν γαρ ϊωαν προϲ ϋμαϲ ε οδω δικεοϲυνηϲ δικαιοϲυνηϲ και ουκ επιϲτευϲα αυτω οι δε τελω και αι πορναι ε αυτω ϋμιϲ δε ειδοντεϲ ου μετεμεληθη ϋϲτερον του πι αυτω

**English Translation**
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots [believed] him; and ye, seeing [it], repented not afterwards, to believe him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The way of righteousness was visible in John, yet the religious leaders remained unmoved even after seeing the fruit of faith in the sinners. Their hardness of heart is absolute; they neither believed at the first nor repented at the last, resisting the evidence of the Spirit.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
αλλην παραβολ παραβολ ακουϲατε οικοδεϲποτηϲ οϲτιϲ εφυτευϲεν αμπελωνα και φραγμον αυτω πε και ω εν αυτω λην λην και ωκοδομηϲ ωκοδομηϲ πυργον και εξεδε εξεδοτο αυτον γεωργοιϲ και απεδημηϲ

**English Translation**
Hear another parable: There was a householder who planted a vineyard, and placed a hedge around it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went abroad.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The householder provides all things necessary for fruitfulness: protection in the hedge, production in the winepress, and oversight in the tower. The vineyard is not abandoned but entrusted; the husbandmen are stewards of a work already established by the master's hand.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
οτε δε ηγγιϲεν ο κ(αι) των καρπων απεϲτιλεν τουϲ δου αυτου προϲ τουϲ γεωργουϲ λαβειν κ̣α̣ι̣ λαβο̣ν̣ τουϲ καρ αυτου

**English Translation**
And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive his fruits.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sending of the servants marks the time of reckoning. The master seeks only what is his own—the fruits of the vineyard—yet the presence of his messengers tests the loyalty of those who hold the land in trust.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και λα οι γεωργοι τουϲ δουλουϲ αυ ον μεν εδιρ ον δε απεκτιν ον δε ελιθοβολη

**English Translation**
And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stewardship of the husbandmen turns to usurpation. They respond to the lawful claim of the owner with escalating violence—beating, killing, and stoning—treating the servants as enemies because they desire to seize the inheritance for themselves.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και παλιν απεϲτι αλλουϲ δουλουϲ πλιοναϲ των πρω και εποιηϲ εποιηϲ αυτοιϲ ωϲαυτωϲ :

**English Translation**
And again he sent other servants more than the first; and they did unto them likewise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Divine patience is displayed in the sending of more servants, granting the husbandmen further opportunity to render what is due. The multiplication of messengers magnifies the guilt of the rejection, as they persist in the same rebellion against a greater witness.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
υϲτερον δε απεϲ προϲ αυτουϲ τον αυτου λεγ εντραπηϲονται τον μου

**English Translation**
And afterwards he sent to them the [one] of him, saying, They will reverence the [one] of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final act of the sender is defined by relationship. He sends "the [one] of him," indicating a distinct possession and intimacy. The expectation is that the husbandmen will recognize this bond; to reverence "the [one] of me" is to acknowledge the authority of the sender himself.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
οι δε γεωργοι ϊδοντεϲ τον ειπον εν ε ουτοϲ εϲ ο κληρονομοϲ δευτε αποκτινω αυτον και ϲχωμεν την κλη αυτου

**English Translation**
But the husbandmen, seeing the [one], said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and let us have the inheritance of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Recognition leads immediately to rebellion. They identify the heir correctly ("this is the heir") but deduce from this truth a necessity for murder ("let us kill him"). Their desire to possess "the inheritance of him" drives them to destroy the one who legitimizes the inheritance.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
και λαβοντεϲ αυτ αυτ εβαλον εξω του αμπελωνοϲ και απεκτιναν

**English Translation**
And taking him, him they cast out of the vineyard and killed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of "him" underscores the focus of their violence. Expulsion precedes execution; they cast him "out of the vineyard," separating the heir from his rightful domain before ending his life. The vineyard is preserved by ejecting its master.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
οταν ουν ελθη ο του αμπελωνοϲ τι ποιηϲι τοιϲ γεωρ εκινοιϲ

**English Translation**
When therefore the [one] of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those husbandmen?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text centers authority in "the [one] of the vineyard." His arrival is certain ("when... he comes"), and his presence demands a judicial response. The question forces a judgment upon the actions of the husbandmen, linking their fate to the owner's return.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
λεγου αυτω κακουϲ κακωϲ απολεϲι αυτουϲ και τον αμπελωνα εκ αλλοιϲ γε οιτινεϲ αποδωϲουϲιν αυ τουϲ καρπουϲ εν τοιϲ καιροιϲ αυ

**English Translation**
They say to him, Bad men, badly he will destroy them, and the vineyard he will let out to other husbandmen, who will render to him the fruits in the seasons of them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Wickedness meets a mirrored destruction: bad men suffer a bad end. The vineyard itself remains but changes hands. The defining characteristic of the new husbandmen is not merely occupation but the rendering of "fruits" at the appointed "seasons." Stewardship is authenticated by return.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτοιϲ ο ου ανεγνω εν τεϲ γραφεϲ ταιϲ γραφαιϲ λιθον ον απεδο οι οικο ου εγενηθη ειϲ κεφαλην γωνιαϲ παρα εγενετο αυτη και εϲτιν θαυ εν οφθαλ ημων

**English Translation**
The [one] says to them, Did you not read in the scriptures, the scriptures? A stone which the builders rejected, this became the head of the corner; from [the Lord] this was, and it is marvelous in our eyes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority of "the scriptures" validates the reversal. The "stone" rejected by the expert builders is established by a higher power as the "head of the corner." This exaltation is not of human making but comes "from" a divine source, rendering it a "marvelous" sight to those who witness it.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
δια τουτο λεγω ϋ αρθηϲετε αφ υ η βαϲιλια του και δοθηϲετε εθνι ποιουντι τουϲ καρ καρπουϲ αυτου αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of the [one] shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Dispossession is the penalty for fruitlessness. "The kingdom of the [one]" is removed from the current tenants and transferred to a "nation" defined by its productivity. The production of "fruits" is the sole criterion for retaining the gift.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) κ(αι) ο πεϲων επι τον λι τουτον ϲυν εφ δ αν πεϲη λικμηϲι αυτον

**English Translation**
And, and the [one] falling upon this stone shall be [broken], on whomsoever it falls, it will scatter him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stone functions as an instrument of judgment in two modes. One may actively fall upon it and be broken, or it may passively fall upon a person and scatter them. In either interaction, the stone remains solid while the one opposing it suffers destruction.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲαντεϲ δε οι αρχϊεριϲ και οι φα φαριϲαιοι ταϲ παραβο αυτου εγνω οτι περι αυτ λεγει

**English Translation**
And hearing, the chief priests and the Pha- Pharisees, the parables of him, they knew that concerning them he speaks.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chief priests and Pharisees possess knowledge ("they knew") but lack repentance. They understand that the "parables" are spoken "concerning them," yet this insight serves only to confirm their opposition. Intellectual comprehension here cements their guilt.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
και ζητουν αυτον κρατη εφοβηθηϲαν τον οχλον τουϲ οχλουϲ επι ειϲ προφητην αυτ ειχον

**English Translation**
And seeking to seize him, they feared the crowd, the crowds, since as a prophet they held him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The leaders' desire to "seize him" is checked only by cowardice. They fear "the crowds" more than the truth of the parables. The people's recognition of him "as a prophet" provides a temporary shield against the malice of the priests.
