**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και μεθ ημεραϲ εξ παραλαμβανει ο ΐϲ τον πετρον και τον ϊακωβον και ϊωανην τον αδελ αυτου και ανα αυτουϲ ειϲ ο ϋψηλον κατ ι

**English Translation**
And after six days Jesus takes Peter and James and John his brother, and brings them up into a high [mountain] apart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The temporal notation of six days suggests a Sabbath of revelation; after the work of the previous days, the Lord leads His chosen ones into rest and vision. He takes only three, signifying a holy remnant or a sufficient witness, separating them from the multitude. The ascent "into a high [mountain]" physically enacts the spiritual elevation required to perceive the divine glory, removing them from earthly concerns to the heights of contemplation.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και μετεμορ εμπροϲθ εμπροϲθ αυτων και ελαμψ ελαμψ το προϲωπον αυ ωϲ ο ηλιοϲ τα δε ϊματια αυτου εγενετο λευκα ωϲ το φωϲ

**English Translation**
And he was transfigured before, before them, and his face shone, shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript's stammering repetition—"before, before," "shone, shone"—reflects the ineffable shock of the event, where human language falters in the face of uncreated light. The Lord does not change His nature but reveals His inherent glory, His face radiating like the sun, the source of illumination, while His garments, representing His flesh or the created order He assumes, become white as light. This manifests the divinity illuminating the humanity without consuming it.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου > ωφθη αυτοιϲ μω και ηλειαϲ ϲ μετ αυ

**English Translation**
And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, [conversing] with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Law, in the person of Moses, and the Prophets, in the person of Elijah, stand as witnesses to the one Lord who is the fulfillment of both. Their appearance signifies the harmony of the Old Covenant with the New, as the servants attend upon the Master. That they are seen "[conversing] with him" demonstrates that the mysteries of the ancient scriptures find their interpretative key and living center in the incarnate Son.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο πετροϲ ειπεν τω καλον εϲτιν ημαϲ ωδε ειναι ει θελειϲ ποιηϲω ωδε τρειϲ ϲκηναϲ ϲοι μι και μωϋϲει μιαν και ηλεια μιαν

**English Translation**
And Peter answering said to the [Lord]: It is good for us to be here; if you will, I will make here three tabernacles, for you one, and for Moses one, and for Elijah one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, overwhelmed by the beatific vision, seeks to capture and render permanent this transient moment of glory by erecting earthly structures. He errs by placing the Master on the same level as the servants, proposing a tabernacle for each as if they were equals. His desire to remain "here" reveals a reluctance to descend to the coming passion, preferring the glory of the mount to the suffering of the cross.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ετι αυτου λαλουν ϊδου νεφελη φωτεινη επεϲκι αυτουϲ και ϊ φωνη εκ τηϲ νεφεληϲ λεγουϲα ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο ϋιοϲ μου ο αγαπητοϲ ε ω ευδοκηϲα ακου αυτου ˙

**English Translation**
While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and [lo], a voice out of the cloud saying: This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I am well pleased; hear him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The bright cloud is the Shekhinah, the visible sign of the Father's presence, which silences Peter's proposal by overshadowing the earthly tents with divine glory. The Voice proclaims the unique sonship of Jesus, distinguishing the "Son" from the servants Moses and Elijah. The command "Hear him" establishes the singular authority of Christ over and above the Law and the Prophets; the Father validates the Son's teaching, even the hard teaching of the cross.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
και ακου οι μαθηται επεϲαν επι προ> αυτων κ(αι) εφοβηθηϲαν ϲφο ·

**English Translation**
And hearing [it], the disciples fell on their faces and feared exceedingly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reaction to the direct speech of the Father is total prostration, a posture of humility and terrifying awe appropriate for the creature before the Creator. Their "exceeding fear" is not merely terror but the holy dread that seizes the soul when the veil of the ordinary is rent. By falling on their faces, they acknowledge their unworthiness to behold the divine majesty.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και προϲηλθ ο και αψαμενοϲ αυτων ειπεν εγερ και μη φοβει

**English Translation**
And the [Jesus] approached and touching them said: Rise and fear not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord bridges the chasm of fear not with a counter-argument but with a touch, imparting strength and reassurance through His humanity. The command "Rise" anticipates the resurrection, calling them up from their death-like posture of terror. "Fear not" is the word of grace that enables the disciple to stand in the presence of God without being destroyed.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
επαραντεϲ δε τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ αυτων ουδενα > ειδον ει μη αυτ αυτ μονον ˙

**English Translation**
And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except him, him alone.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vision concludes by stripping away all intermediaries—Moses and Elijah have vanished, leaving "him alone." This visual simplicity reinforces the theological truth that Jesus is the sole sufficiency for the Church. The Law and Prophets recede so that the focus may rest entirely on the Son, who embodies and surpasses them; to see Him alone is to see the fullness of God's revelation.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και κατα αυτ εκ του ορουϲ ενε> αυτοιϲ ο λεγων μηδενι ει το οραμα εωϲ ου ο ϋϊοϲ του α α εκ νεκρων αναϲτη

**English Translation**
And [as they descended] from the mountain, the [Jesus] commanded them, saying: Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man rises from the dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The descent from the mountain marks the return to the realm of human limitation and the path to suffering. The command of silence protects the mystery from premature and political misunderstanding; the glory of the Transfiguration can only be rightly understood through the lens of the Resurrection. The title "Son of Man" links this glory to the suffering servant, binding the vision on the mount to the victory over the grave.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και πηρωτηϲαν επηρωτηϲαν αυ οι μαθηται λε τι ουν οι γραμματειϲ λεγου οτι ηλειαν δει ελθειν πρωτον

**English Translation**
And the disciples asked, asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples, having just seen Elijah withdraw, are confused by the scribal teaching that Elijah's permanent return must precede the Messiah. Their repetition in asking ("asked, asked") betrays their anxiety over the timeline of salvation. They struggle to reconcile the fleeting vision of Elijah on the mountain with the expectation of his public, restorative ministry in the world.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ειπ αυτοιϲ οτι ηλειαϲ μεν ερχεται και α π

**English Translation**
And answering he said to them that: Elijah indeed comes and [will restore all].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord confirms the validity of the prophecy: Elijah has a role in the economy of salvation to "restore all," preparing the way for the Lord. He does not dismiss the scribal knowledge but orients it correctly. The "restoration" speaks to the turning of hearts and the preparation of a people, a work of spiritual renewal rather than political establishment.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
λεγω δε ϋμιν οτι ηλειαϲ ηδη ηλθεν και ουκ επεγνω αυτον αλλ ε αυτω ο ηθεληϲαν ουτωϲ και ο ϋϊοϲ του αν μελλει > παϲχειν υπ αυτ

**English Translation**
But I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not know him, but did to him whatever they wished; so also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Jesus identifies the fulfillment of the Elijah prophecy in the recent past—referring to John the Baptist—who was met not with acceptance but with violence. The failure to "know him" is a failure of spiritual recognition, leading to persecution. By drawing a parallel between the precursor's suffering and His own, the Lord teaches that the path of the Messiah and His prophets is one of rejection by the world, leading to the cross.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ϲυνηκαν οι μαθηται οτι πε ϊωανου του βα ειπεν αυ ·

**English Translation**
Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The perception of the disciples is not immediate; it requires the instruction of the Master to unveil the reality of the prophetic office. They grasp that the figure of John the Baptist was the one intended, understanding that the forerunner has already completed his course.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και ελθοντ προϲ τον οχλον προϲηλθεν αυτω ανθρωποϲ γονυ> αυτον

**English Translation**
And coming to the crowd, a man came to him, kneeling before him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The man separates himself from the multitude to approach the source of authority directly. His posture of kneeling signifies a total abasement and a recognition that help resides solely in the one to whom he bows.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
και λεγων ελεηϲον μου τον υϊον οτι ϲελη και κακωϲ εχει πολλακιϲ γαρ πιπτει ειϲ το πυρ κ(αι) πολλακιϲ ειϲ το ϋ

**English Translation**
And saying, Have mercy on my son, for he is moonstruck and suffers badly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The father presents the suffering of the son as an urgent plea for mercy, describing an affliction that violently tosses the boy between the extremes of fire and water. The moonstruck condition indicates a malady that strikes intermittently but with destructive force, threatening life by contrary elements.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και προϲηνεγ αυτον τοιϲ μα ϲου και ουκʼ ηδυνηθηϲαν αυ θεραπευϲαι

**English Translation**
And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The incapacity of the disciples serves as a witness to human frailty even among those chosen. The father's report exposes that proximity to the teacher does not automatically confer the teacher's power, highlighting the necessity of the Master's direct intervention.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ τοτε αποκριθειϲ ο ει> αυτοιϲ ω γε> απιϲτοϲ και δι εωϲ ποτε μεθ υμων εϲομαι εωϲ ποτε ανεξομαι ϋμων φερετε μοι αυτον ωδε

**English Translation**
And answering, then answering, he said to them: O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord expresses the burden of dwelling amidst a generation defined by a lack of faith and distortion. He commands the problem to be transferred from the incapable hands of the disciples to his own presence, asserting his authority over the failure of his followers.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και επετιμη αυτω ο και εξηλθεν απ αυτου το δαιμονιον και εθεραπευθη απο τηϲ ωραϲ εκεινηϲ

**English Translation**
And he rebuked him, and the demon went out from him; and he was healed from that hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rebuke is delivered with absolute authority, effecting an immediate separation between the sufferer and the demon. The healing is instantaneous, marking the specific hour as the moment of liberation from the possessing force.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲελθον> οι μαθηται τω κατ ϊδιαν ειπαν δια τι ημειϲ ουκ η εκβα αυτο ˙

**English Translation**
Then the disciples, coming to him in private, said: Why were we not able to cast it out?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Seeking to understand their deficiency, the disciples approach in private to inquire into the cause of their powerlessness. They acknowledge their failure without excuse, asking only for the reason why their agency was insufficient.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ο δε λε> αυτοιϲ δια τ ολιγοπιϲτιαν ϋμ αμην γαρ λεγω ϋμ εαν εχητε πιϲτιν ωϲ κοκκον ϲινα ερειτε τω ο τουτω μεταβα ενθεν εκει και με και ου αδυνατηϲει ϋμιν

**English Translation**
And he says to them: Because of your little faith. For amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The diagnosis of their failure is the smallness of their faith. The Lord illustrates that true faith, even if minute as a grain of mustard, possesses a vitality capable of displacing the massive inertia of a mountain, rendering the impossible subject to the believer's command.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
τουτο δε το γενοϲ ουκ εκβαλλεται ει μη εν προϲευχη κ(αι) νηϲτεια

**English Translation**
But this kind is not cast out except by prayer and fasting.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Certain forms of spiritual oppression are entrenched deeply and yield only to a fortified spirit. The expulsion of such a kind requires the dual discipline of prayer, which binds the soul to God, and fasting, which severs the flesh from the world.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ϲυϲτρεφο δε αυτ εν τη γαλειλαια ει αυτοιϲ ο μελ ο ϋιοϲ του παραδιδοϲθαι ειϲ χειραϲ ανθρωπ

**English Translation**
And while they were gathering in Galilee, he said to them: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the region of Galilee, the teaching turns toward the coming betrayal. The title Son of Man emphasizes his identity, while the prophecy highlights the tragic paradox that he will be surrendered into the control of the very humanity he represents.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και αποκτενου αυτον και τη τριτη ημερα εγερ και ελυ ϲφοδρα

**English Translation**
And they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised. And they were grieved exceedingly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prediction of death is inseparable from the promise of the resurrection on the third day. However, the exceeding grief of the disciples reveals that they hear the finality of the killing but have not yet grasped the victory of the rising.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
ελθοντων δε αυ ειϲ καφαρνα προϲηλθον οι τα τ̣α διδραχμα λαμ τω πε και ειπον ειπαν ο > διδαϲκαλοϲ υμ ου τελει τα διδραχμα

**English Translation**
And when they came to Capharnaum, those receiving the didrachma came to Peter and said: Does your teacher not pay the didrachma?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
At Capharnaum, the collectors confront Peter regarding the civic and religious obligations of his master. The question concerns the payment of the didrachma, testing whether the teacher submits to the customary tribute required of the people.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
λεγει ναι και ειϲελθοντα ελθοντα ειϲελθοντα ειϲ την οικιαν προε αυτον ο λεγων τι ϲοι > δοκει ϲιμων οι > βαϲιλειϲ τηϲ γηϲ απο τινων λαμ τελη η κηνϲον απο > των υϊων αυτ η απο των αλλο

**English Translation**
He says, "Yes." And entering entering entering into the house, the *one* speaking *was* before him, asking, "What to you seems, Simon? The kings of the earth, from whom do they tak[e] customs or census? From the sons of th[em] or from the oth[ers]?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the profound urgency in the threefold repetition of entry—"entering, entering, entering"—as recorded in this witness. It is as though the soul must pass through multiple veils or thresholds to arrive at the interior privacy of the house where divine instruction occurs. The One speaking anticipates Simon, knowing the thoughts before they are voiced. The inquiry concerns the nature of earthly sovereignty versus divine sonship. The text abbreviates the actions of the world—"tak[e]" and "oth[ers]" are cut short—signifying that the grasp of earthly kings is truncated and passing, possessing no fullness in the face of the eternal Kingdom.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εφη α των αλλοτρι ειποντοϲ δε απο των αλλοτριων εφη αυτω ο αρα γε ελευθεροι ειϲιν οι υϊοι

**English Translation**
And he said, "Fr[om] the strange[rs]." And upon *his* saying, "From the strangers," the *one* said to him, "Then indeed free are the sons."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The dialogue establishes a crucial distinction between the children of the household and those who are external to it. Simon correctly identifies that tribute is extracted from the "strangers" or aliens, not from the progeny of the monarch. The Lord confirms this judgment, declaring the sons "free." This liberty is not merely political exemption but an ontological reality; those who belong to the true King are not subject to the servitude of the world, even if they dwell within it. They stand apart, liberated by their filiation.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ϊνα δε μη > ϲκανδαλιζωμεν αυτουϲ πορευθειϲ ειϲ θαλαϲϲαν βαλε βαλε αγκιϲτρον και τον αναβαντα πρωτ πρωτ ϊχθυν αρον και α το ϲτομα αυτου ευρηϲειϲ > ϲτατηρα εκεινον λαβων δοϲ αυτοιϲ αντι εμου και ϲου

**English Translation**
"But lest we scandalize them, going into sea cast cast hook, and the coming up fir[st] fir[st] fish take; and op[ening] the mouth of it you will find a stater. That taking give to them for me and you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Though free by right, the Son submits to the law of the strangers to prevent "scandal," showing that humility often requires the voluntary suspension of one's rights for the sake of the weak. The command is emphatic, marked by the doubling of words—"cast cast" and "fir[st] fir[st]"—indicating the precision and certainty of the divine provision. Creation itself serves the Master; the sea and the fish yield up the necessary tribute. The single stater suffices for two, binding the Speaker and Simon together in one act of payment, uniting the Head and the member in the same redemption from earthly demand.
