**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και προϲελθοντεϲ οι φαριϲαιοι και οι ϲαδδουκαιοι πι επηρω ηρωτηϲαν επηρωτων αυτον ϲημι εκ του επιδιξε αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
And coming, the Pharisees and the Sadducees [testing] asked, were asking Him to show them a sign from the [source].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisees and Sadducees approach in a united front, their doctrinal differences set aside for a common hostility. Their request is repetitive and insistent, demanding a visible spectacle "from the," yet the text leaves the origin of this sign unspoken, emphasizing the emptiness of their demand. They seek to constrain Him with a display of power, yet they lack the eyes to see the One standing before them.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε αποκριθειϲ ει αυτοιϲ

**English Translation**
But answering He said to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He does not retreat from their interrogation but meets them directly. The brevity of the encounter suggests an immediate and authoritative response to their challenge.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
γενε πονηρα και μοι ϲημιον ε και ϲημι ου δοθηϲετε αυτη ει μη το ϲη ϊωνα ˙ και κα αυτουϲ απηλθεν ˙

**English Translation**
An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah. And [leaving] them He went away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The craving for signs is the mark of an unfaithful and adulterous generation, one that seeks external proofs rather than internal transformation. The only sign granted is that of Jonah, pointing toward a mystery of descent and return rather than a celestial spectacle. His departure is a judgment; by leaving them, He abandons them to their own blindness.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και ελ οι μαθη ειϲ το περαν ε αρτουϲ λαβειν

**English Translation**
And coming to the other side, the disciples [forgot] to take loaves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The transition to the other side is marked by a failure of memory and provision. The disciples' physical journey is accompanied by a negligence regarding sustenance, creating a context where material lack will cloud spiritual perception.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ὁ δε ειπεν ορατε και προϲεχετε απο τηϲ ζυμηϲ των φαριϲαιων και ϲαδδουκαι

**English Translation**
But He said, See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He commands vigilance against a hidden corruption. The leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees is not a physical substance but a pervasive influence that works silently to sour the whole lump of the community's faith.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
οι δε διελογιζον εν εαυτοιϲ λεγ οτι αρτουϲ ου ελαβομεν ˙

**English Translation**
But they reasoned among themselves saying, Because we took no loaves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Their internal reasoning is tethered to the earth, interpreting a spiritual warning solely through the lens of their physical hunger. They assume the rebuke concerns their failure to procure bread, revealing how material anxiety stifles higher understanding.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
γνουϲ δε ο ειπ τι διαλογιζεϲθε ε εαυτοιϲ ολιγο οτι αρτουϲ ουκ εχετε

**English Translation**
But knowing, He said, Why do you reason among yourselves, little-faiths, because you have no loaves?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He discerns their thoughts without need of words, exposing the root of their confusion as a lack of faith. The title "little-faiths" identifies their anxiety over bread as a spiritual deficiency, not merely a logistical error.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ουπω νοειτε ουδε μνημονευεται τουϲ πεντε αρτουϲ τ πεντακιϲχιλιων και ποϲουϲ κοφι ελαβετε

**English Translation**
Do you not yet perceive nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Understanding is inseparable from memory; to forget the past work of God is to remain blind in the present. The abundance of the five loaves for the five thousand should have silenced their fears, yet their amnesia leaves them anxious.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ου τουϲ · · αρτουϲ τ τ τετρακιϲχιλιων και ποϲαϲ ϲπυριδαϲ ελαβετε

**English Translation**
Nor the loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets you took?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A second witness to abundance is invoked, yet it too has faded from their minds. The specific mention of the four thousand serves to compound the tragedy of their unbelief; repeated miracles have not yet cured their worry.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
πωϲ ου νοειτε οτι ου πε αρτων ειπον υ προϲεχετε δε απο τηϲ ζυμηϲ τ τ φαρειϲαιων και ϲαδ

**English Translation**
How do you not perceive that I spoke not to you concerning loaves? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The frustration with their dullness is evident; the distinction between material bread and spiritual danger must be forced upon them. The command to beware is reiterated, stripping away the literal interpretation to reveal the moral imperative.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ϲυνηκαν οτι ουκ ει προϲεχειν α τηϲ ζυμηϲ τ φαρειϲαιων και ϲαδ αρτ αλλα α τηϲ διδαϲκαλιαϲ διδαχηϲ των φαρειϲαιων κ(αι) ϲαδδουκαιων

**English Translation**
Then they understood that He said not to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees [bread] but of the teaching [doctrine] of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Clarity arrives only after correction. They finally grasp that the leaven signifies the teaching and doctrine of the sects, which spreads invisibly and corrupts the truth, just as yeast alters the dough.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ελθων δε ο ειϲ τα μερη καιϲαριαϲ τηϲ φιλιππου ηρωτα τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυ λεγων τινα οι α ειναι λεγουϲ λεγουϲ ειναι τον υϊον του α

**English Translation**
Now coming into the parts of Caesarea Philippi He asked His disciples saying, Whom do men say the Son of Man is?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the region of Caesarea Philippi, the question of identity becomes paramount. By asking what men say of the Son of Man, He invites the disciples to distinguish the truth from the confusion of the crowds.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
οι δε ειπον οι μεν ιωανην τον βαπτι αλλοι δε ηλι ετεροι δε ϊερεμιαν η ενα των προφητ

**English Translation**
And they said, "Some indeed John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and different ones Jeremiah or one of the prophets."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowds perceive a resemblance to holiness but fail to grasp the substance of divinity. They categorize the One before them merely as a successor to the servants, naming John the Baptist, Elijah, or Jeremiah. The world sees a prophet where the faithful must see the Lord; they recognize the voice of the prophets but do not yet discern the Word who sent them.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτοιϲ υμειϲ δε τινα με λεγετε ειναι

**English Translation**
He says to them, "But you, who do you say me to be?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord separates the disciples from the multitude with this interrogation. It is not enough to report the rumors of others; the disciple must possess a personal confession. He demands a definition of His person that arises not from public opinion but from intimate knowledge of His presence.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ ωᵨ δε ϲιμων πετροϲ ειπεν ϲυ ει ο ο του του ζ ·

**English Translation**
And answering, Simon Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Simon Peter speaks the definitive truth which separates the Church from the synagogue and the world. He confesses the Sonship and the anointing, identifying the Master not merely as a teacher, but as the Son of the living God. The use of "living" distinguishes the true God from dead idols and establishes the eternal generation of the Son.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθειϲ δε ο ειπεν αυτω μακαριοϲ ει ϲιμων βαρϊωνα οτι ϲαρξ · και αιμα ουκ απε ϲοι αλλα ο π μου ο εν τοιϲ ουρανοιϲ

**English Translation**
And answering, Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood did not reveal [it] to you, but my Father who is in the heavens."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The confession of the divinity of the Son is itself a divine gift, not a human deduction. Flesh and blood possess no capacity to discern heavenly mysteries; such knowledge must descend from the Father in the heavens. Simon is declared blessed because he has become a recipient of the Father's revelation concerning the Son.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
καγω δε ϲοι λεγω οτι ϲυ ει πε και επι ταυτη τη πετρα οικοδο> μου την εκ και πυλαι αδου ου κατιϲχυϲου αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and gates of Hades will not prevail against it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord responds to the rock of Peter's faith with the promise of an unconquerable structure. The Church is built by Christ Himself upon this foundation, and its durability is absolute. The gates of Hades, representing the power of death and the underworld, attempt to overpower it but lack the strength to prevail against the divine edifice.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
δωϲω > ϲοι ταϲ κλιδαϲ κλιϲ τηϲ βαϲιλειαϲ των ου και ο εαν δη επι την γην τηϲ γηϲ ε δεδεμενον εν τοιϲ ουρανοιϲ και ο εαν λυϲηϲ ε> τηϲ γηϲ εϲται λε εν τοιϲ ουρανοιϲ

**English Translation**
I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatever you bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatever you loose upon the earth shall be loosed in the heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Authority is transferred from the heavens to the earth through the gift of the keys. The administrative power to bind and to loose is not restricted to the terrestrial realm but carries the weight of divine ratification. The judgment exercised by the steward upon the earth is mirrored instantly in the heavens, establishing a unity of governance between God and His Church.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
τοτε διε τοιϲ μαθη ϊνα μηδενι ει οτι αυτοϲ εϲτιν ο

**English Translation**
Then he commanded the disciples that to no one they should say that he is the Christ.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The truth of His identity is established among the chosen but silenced before the world. The title of Christ carries a weight that the uninitiated are not yet prepared to bear. Silence is imposed to prevent a premature proclamation before the necessary work of the passion is accomplished.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
απο τοτε ηρξατο ο δικνυειν τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου οτι δει αυτον ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα απελ και πολλα πα απο των πρε και αρχι και γραμμα και αποκτ και τη τριτη ημερα εγερθηναι

**English Translation**
From then [Jesus] began to show to his disciples that it is necessary [for] him to go away to Jerusalem, and to suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and on the third day to be raised.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The necessity of suffering is unveiled immediately after the confession of glory. The path to Jerusalem is not for earthly enthronement but for rejection by the religious authorities—the elders, chief priests, and scribes. Yet, the grim prediction of being killed is inextricably bound to the promise of being raised on the third day; the death is the prerequisite for the resurrection.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και προϲλαβομενοϲ αυτον ο πετροϲ ηρ επιτιμαν αυ λεγων ειλεωϲ ϲοι ου μη εϲται ϲοι τουτο ·

**English Translation**
And taking him, Peter began to rebuke him, saying, "[God be] merciful to you; this shall by no means be to you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, who previously spoke by the Father's revelation, now speaks from human sentiment. He presumes to rebuke the Lord, rejecting the necessity of the cross out of a misplaced desire for mercy. He seeks to protect the Master from the very purpose for which the Master came.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ϲτρα ειπεν τω πε υπαγε οπιϲω μου ϲατανα ϲκαν ει εμου μου οτι ου φρονειϲ τα του αλλα τα των αν

**English Translation**
But he, turning, said to Peter, "Go behind me, Satan; you are a stumbling block to me, because you do not mind the things of [God], but the things of men."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rebuke is turned back upon the disciple with terrifying severity. Peter is addressed as Satan because, in opposing the suffering of the Christ, he acts the part of the adversary. To mind the things of men is to seek self-preservation and ease; to mind the things of God is to accept the sacrificial death. Peter is a stumbling block because he stands in the way of the divine economy.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ο ειπεν τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου ει τιϲ θελει οπιϲω μου ελθειν απαρνη εαυτον κ(αι) αρατω τον ϲταυ αυτου και ακο μοι

**English Translation**
Then [Jesus] said to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to come behind me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Discipleship requires an imitation of the Master's path. One cannot follow behind Him without also taking up the instrument of death, the cross. To deny oneself is to abdicate the sovereignty of the will, submitting entirely to the difficult road that leads to Jerusalem and beyond.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
οϲ γαρ εαν θελη την ψυχην αυτου ϲω απολεϲει αυτ οϲ δ αν απολεϲη > την ψυχην αυτου ενεκεν εμου ευ> αυτην

**English Translation**
For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great paradox of the faith: preservation leads to destruction, while sacrifice leads to recovery. To clutch at one's life in this world is to forfeit it eternally. It is only by loosening one's grasp on the soul for the sake of the Christ that one secures it in truth.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
τι γαρ ωφεληθηϲεται ανθρωποϲ εαν οταν εαν τ κοϲμον ολον κερ την δε ψυχ ψυχ αυτου ζημιωθη η τι δωϲει α τηϲ ψυ αυτου

**English Translation**
For what shall a man be profited if whenever if the whole world he gain, but his soul soul be forfeited? Or what shall he give as exchange for his soul?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers with the urgency of the condition, reading "if whenever if," revealing the precarious nature of worldly accumulation. Against this uncertain stutter stands the repetition of the "soul soul," emphasizing the twofold reality of the human spirit: that which lives in the flesh and that which endures for judgment. The man who gains the cosmos finds it lighter than the double weight of the soul he loses; there is no "exchange" sufficient to buy back what has no price in the market of creation.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
μελλει γαρ ο ϋϊοϲ του ερχεϲθαι εν τη δο του π αυτου μετα των αγγελ αγγελ αυτου και τοτε απο εκαϲτω κατα τα εργα την πραξιν αυτου

**English Translation**
For the Son of the is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels angels; and then he will render to each according to the works the practice of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The title "Son of the" stands absolute, requiring no further qualification to identify his divinity. He arrives not merely with messengers, but with "angels angels," a redoubled host signifying an innumerable and terrifying majesty. The judgment he brings scrutinizes both "works" and "practice"—the singular deeds performed and the habitual conduct of life. Nothing is hidden from the Son who comes in the Father's glory to repay the debt of human action.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
αμ λεγω ϋμιν οτι ειϲ τινεϲ των ωδε εϲτω οιτινεϲ ου μη γευϲωνται θανα εωϲ αν ϊδωϲιν τον υϊον του ερχομενον εν τη βαϲιλεια αυτου δοξη τ(ου) αυτου

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the Son of the coming in his kingdom, glory of the of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise is sealed with "Amen," assuring those standing that the vision of the Kingdom precedes the finality of death for some. They shall see the "Son of the" not in weakness, but coming in a kingdom defined by "glory of the of him"—a glory that belongs intrinsically to him and to the One who sent him. To see this Kingdom is to perceive the reality of the Son before the earthly shadow of death covers the eyes.
