**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
εν εκινω τω καιρω επορευθη ο τοιϲ ϲαββαϲιν δια των ϲποριμ οι δε μαθητε αυτου επιναϲαν και ηρ τιλλιν ϲτα και εϲθιειν

**English Translation**
At that time went the [one] on the sabbaths through the grainfields; and his disciples hungered and began to pluck ears and to eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Master walks through the fields of provision even on the days set apart for rest, signifying that his path is never severed from the sustenance of life. The disciples, driven by the pangs of the body, reach out to the creation to sustain their walk with him. It is hunger that compels the action, demonstrating that the necessity of life precedes the rigidity of the observance.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
οι δε φαριϲαιοι ϊδ ειπαν αυτω ϊ οι μαθηται ϲου ποιουϲιν ο ουκ ε ποιειν ϲαββατω

**English Translation**
But the Pharisees seeing said to him, Behold, thy disciples do what is not lawful to do on a sabbath.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Those who watch with critical eyes see the deed but fail to perceive the need. They appeal to the lawfulness of the act, attempting to bind the followers of the Truth with the chains of human tradition regarding the holy day. Their accusation reveals a heart that values the cessation of activity over the preservation of the living.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ ου ανεγνωτε τι ε οτε επιναϲεν και οι μετ αυτου

**English Translation**
But he said to them, Have ye not read what [he] did when he hungered, and those with him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He redirects their gaze from the present accusation to the ancient record which they claim to know. The defense rests upon the history of the hungering one, establishing a continuity between the needs of the saints of old and the disciples of the present. Scripture is the mirror in which the lawful nature of necessity is reflected.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
πωϲ ειϲηλθεν ειϲ τον οικον του και τουϲ αρτουϲ τηϲ προθεϲεωϲ εφαγ ουϲ ουκ εξον ην αυτω φαγιν ουδε τοιϲ μετ αυτου ει μη τοιϲ ϊερευϲιν μονοιϲ

**English Translation**
How he entered into the house of the [God] and ate the loaves of the setting forth, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those with him, if not for the priests only.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred house and the holy bread, reserved by law for the priesthood, yield to the urgent cry of hunger. The sanctity of the offering is not violated but fulfilled when it sustains the life of the elect. The exception granted to the one who entered proves that mercy is the higher law governing the house of the [God].

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
η ουκ ανεγνωτε εν τω νομω οτι τοιϲ ϲαββαϲιν οι ϊεριϲ εν τω ϊερω το ϲαββατον βεβη και αναι ειϲιν

**English Translation**
Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are guiltless?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The law contains within itself the justification for work done in service to the holy. The priests labor in the temple, technically breaking the rest, yet they incur no guilt because the location and the duty sanctify the action. Service to the divine presence renders the worker innocent of the transgression of rest.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
λεγω δε ϋμιν οτι του ϊερου μιζον εϲτιν ωδε

**English Translation**
But I say to you that a greater [thing] than the temple is here.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
If the stone temple justifies the labor of its servants, how much more does the living presence of the Greater One justify his disciples. The locus of holiness has shifted from the building to the Person. Where the Greater One stands, the rules governing the shadow must give way to the reality of the substance.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ει δε εγνωκειτε τι εϲτιν ελεοϲ θελω και ου θυϲιαν ου αν κατεδικαϲα τουϲ αναιτιουϲ

**English Translation**
But if ye had known what is, Mercy I will and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ignorance of the divine nature leads to the condemnation of the innocent. The heart of the Father desires the internal disposition of mercy rather than the external mechanism of sacrifice. Had the accusers understood this fundamental truth, they would not have passed judgment upon those who are blameless in their necessity.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
γαρ εϲτιν του ϲαβ ο του α

**English Translation**
For of the sabbath is the [one] of the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The [one] of the man is not subject to the day, but possesses it. The authority over the day of rest resides in the representative of humanity. The sabbath exists to serve the purpose of the one who defines it, establishing his dominion over the very structure of time and observance.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και μεταβαϲ εκιθ ηλθεν ειϲ την ϲυ αυτων

**English Translation**
And having departed thence, he came into their synagogue.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He moves from the field to the gathered assembly, entering the specific place of their instruction. It is called "their" synagogue, distinguishing their domain from his inherent authority. He enters the fold of the legalists to demonstrate the true intent of the law.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και ϊδου α χιρα εχων ξηραν και επηρωτηϲαν αυ λεγοντεϲ ει εξεϲτιν τοιϲ ϲαβ θεραπευϲε ϊνα κατηγορηϲω αυτου

**English Translation**
And behold, a man having a withered hand. And they asked him, saying, If it is lawful on the sabbaths to heal? that they might accuse him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sight of human suffering, a withered hand incapable of work or worship, provokes not pity but a trap. The questioners weaponize the law, seeking to turn an act of divine restoration into a crime. They value the restriction of the day more than the wholeness of the man, looking for grounds to bring a charge against the Healer.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ τιϲ εϲται εξ υμ α οϲ εξι προβα εν και εαν πε ενπεϲη τουτο τοιϲ ϲαβ ειϲ βοθυν ουχι κρατηϲαϲ ε αυτο

**English Translation**
But he said to them, Who shall be of you a man who shall have one sheep, and if this fall on the sabbaths into a pit, will he not, having laid hold, raise it?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He exposes their hypocrisy by appealing to their own dealings with property. Even for a beast, a sheep of the flock, they will suspend their rest to rescue it from a pit. They lay hold and raise the animal to save it from death or loss, proving that they understand the necessity of action when their own interests are at stake.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
ποϲω ουν διαφε προβατου ωϲτε εξεϲτιν τοιϲ ϲαββαϲιν καλωϲ ποιειν

**English Translation**
By how much therefore differs [one] from a sheep! So that it is lawful on the sabbaths to do well.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The incomparable worth of the human soul over the beast establishes the rule. If a sheep may be saved, a man must be healed. The conclusion of the matter is that doing well—acting for the good and restoration of life—is the very essence of lawfulness on the holy day. Goodness is the true fulfillment of the sabbath.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγι τω α εκτινον ϲου την χειρα ϲου και εξετιν και απεκατεϲτα ϋγιηϲ

**English Translation**
Then he says to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and it was restored healthy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the immediacy of the divine command and the human response. The voice that speaks is the same that orders creation; it does not ask for capability but creates it within the act of obedience. The hand, withered and useless, becomes the instrument of a miracle solely through the will to extend it at the Master’s word. Restoration is not merely a repair of the flesh but a return to the healthy function intended by the Creator.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
εξελθοντεϲ δε οι φαριϲεοι ϲυμβου ελαβον κα αυτου οπωϲ αυ απολεϲωϲιν

**English Translation**
But going out, the Pharisees took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the malice which arises in the face of goodness; while the hand is restored within, the hearts without are withered by envy. They take counsel not to learn the source of such power, but to extinguish the light that exposes their darkness. The preservation of the man’s life provokes a conspiracy for the Saviour’s death, revealing that the mind set on destruction cannot abide the manifestation of health.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ο δε γνουϲ ανε εκιθ και ηκολουθηϲ αυτω πολλοι και εθεραπευϲεν αυ πανταϲ

**English Translation**
But knowing, he withdrew from there; and many followed him, and he healed them all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He withdraws not out of fear, but from a knowledge that perceives the thoughts of men. This retreat is fruitful, for in moving away from the treacherous counsel, he draws the multitude who seek life. His departure does not cease his work; rather, the stream of mercy widens, and he heals all who follow, showing that the malice of the few cannot hinder the abundance of grace for the many.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και επετιμηϲεν αυτοιϲ ϊνα μη φα αυτον ποι

**English Translation**
And he charged them that they should not make him known.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Silence is enjoined upon those who have received the benefit, for the Lord seeks not the applause of the streets but the quiet transformation of the soul. He charges them to hide his fame, teaching us that true power is content to work in hiddenness. To make him known before the proper time is to risk misunderstanding the nature of his kingdom, which is not of clamour but of truth.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ϊνα πλη το ρηθεν δι ηϲαιου του προ λεγοντοϲ

**English Translation**
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The events of the Gospel are anchored in the ancient testimonies, proving that the withdrawal and the silence were foreseen in the divine economy. The Evangelist calls upon Esaias to witness that this gentleness is not accidental but the very mark of the Chosen One. What occurs in time completes what was uttered in the Spirit, binding the new works to the old promises.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ϊδου ο παιϲ μου ο ηρετιϲα ο αγαπη μου ειϲ ον ηϋδο η ψυχη μου θηϲω το μου επ αυτον και κριϲ κριϲ τοιϲ εθνεϲιν απαγ

**English Translation**
Behold my servant whom I chose, my beloved in whom my soul was well pleased; I will put my [Spirit] upon him, and judgment judgment to the nations he will announce.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of the Trinity and the Incarnation interwoven: the Father speaks of the Servant, the Beloved, and places that which is His—the Spirit—upon him. The pleasure of the Father rests in the Son, whose mission extends beyond Israel to the nations. He announces judgment, yet this judgment is repeated, emphasized, suggesting a definitive decree that separates light from darkness for all peoples.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ουκ εριϲει ου κραυγαϲει ουδε α τιϲ εν τεϲ ταιϲ πλατιαιϲ την φω αυτου

**English Translation**
He will not strive, nor cry out, nor will anyone [hear] in the streets his voice.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The character of the divine judge is meekness; he conquers not by the noise of contention but by the quiet persistence of truth. The world expects power to arrive with a shout and a struggle, but he refrains from the clamour of the marketplace. His voice is not heard in the broad ways of vanity, for he speaks to the inner man, far removed from the tumult of sedition and pride.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
καλα ϲυντετριμ ου κατεα και λινον τυ ου ϲβεϲι εωϲ αν εκβαλη ειϲ νικοϲ την κρι

**English Translation**
A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench, until he sends forth the judgment unto victory.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the tenderness of the Physician who tends to the fragile and the failing. The bruised reed, weak and damaged, is not discarded; the smoking flax, barely alive with fire, is not extinguished. He nurtures the smallest spark of faith and sustains the weary soul until the final victory of judgment is achieved. Justice here is not destruction, but the triumph of mercy over infirmity.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και τω ονο αυτου εθνη ελπιουϲιν

**English Translation**
And in his name nations shall hope.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise expands to encompass the inhabited world; the Gentiles, once strangers, find their anchor in his name. Hope is the proper response to the revelation of such a gentle King. It is not in the power of arms or the wisdom of men that the nations trust, but in the name of the one who heals the bruised and silenced the cry of strife.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
τοτε προϲηνεχθη αυτω δαιμονιζο τυφλοϲ και κωφοϲ και ε αυ αυτον ωϲτε τον κωφον κ(αι) λαλειν και βλεπιν

**English Translation**
Then was brought to him one demon-possessed, blind and dumb; and he healed him, so that the dumb man both spoke and saw.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The captivity of the man was threefold: possessed by a demon, blind to the light, and dumb in speech. The Lord, the liberator of the senses and the soul, heals him instantly, restoring sight to the eyes and words to the tongue. When the demon is cast out, the faculties return to their natural use, signifying that the presence of evil shuts up the senses, but the presence of Christ opens them to perceive and praise God.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και ε παντεϲ οι οχλοι και ελε μητι ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο

**English Translation**
And all the crowds were amazed and said, Is this not the [one]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The multitude is struck with displacement of mind, amazed by the authority over the invisible spirits. Their question, though truncated in the text, points to the singular identity they anticipate. They see the works and begin to discern the person, asking if this man stands as the specific figure of their expectation. The indefinite "the one" marks the dawn of recognition that he is unique among men.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
οι δε φαριϲαιοι ακου ειπον ου ουκ εκβαλλι τα δαιμονια ει μη εν τω βεεζεβουλ αρχοντι των δε δαιμονιων

**English Translation**
But the Pharisees, hearing, said, This one does not cast out the demons except in Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Unable to deny the miracle, they malign the source, attributing the work of the Holy One to the ruler of demons. This is the height of blindness: to see a demon expelled and yet claim the act is served by the demonic prince Beelzebul. By asserting that deliverance comes from the destroyer, they invert the order of reality, calling light darkness and declaring that the kingdom of evil is divided against itself to save face.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ϊδωϲ ϊδων ϊδωϲ δε ταϲ ενθυ αυτων ει αυτοιϲ παϲα βαϲιλια μεριϲθιϲα καθ εαυτηϲ ερημου και παϲα πολιϲ η οι μεριϲθιϲα κα εαυτηϲ ου ϲταθη

**English Translation**
Knowing seeing knowing but their thoughts, he said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself is desolated, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord manifests His divine authority by "knowing seeing knowing" the interior movements of the mind before they are spoken. He reveals that division is not merely a political failing but an ontological defect; that which turns against its own nature—whether a vast kingdom, a city, or a single house—invokes desolation. Unity is the condition of existence, while division is the precursor to non-being.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και ει ο ϲαταναϲ τον ϲαταναν εκβαλλι εφ εαυτον εμερι πωϲ ουν ϲταθηϲε η βαϲιλια αυτου

**English Translation**
And if Satan casts out Satan, against himself he was divided; how then will his kingdom stand?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The argument demonstrates the absurdity of evil working against its own interest. If the adversary were to expel himself, he would dismantle the very dominion he seeks to maintain. The collapse of such a kingdom is inevitable, for no power can endure if its operation destroys its own foundation.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και ει εγω εν βεε εκβαλλω τα δαιμονια οι ϋϊ ϋμων εν τινι εκβαλλουϲιν δια τουτο αυτοι κρι εϲονται ϋμ

**English Translation**
And if I by Beelzeboul cast out the demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He turns their accusation back upon their own kin. If the act of expulsion is the same, the source of power must be consistent; to condemn the Source in Him is to condemn it in their own sons. These sons, operating under the same covenant, become the living witnesses against the malice of the accusers.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ει δε εν εγω εκβαλλω τα δεμο δαιμονια αρα εφθαϲεν εφ ϋμαϲ η βαϲιλι του

**English Translation**
But if by [?] I cast out the demons, then the kingdom of the [God] has come upon you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The expulsion of the demonic is the tangible proof of the arrival of the Kingdom. The Kingdom is not a distant hope but a present reality that displaces the tyranny of the enemy. Where the demons are cast out, there the reign of the Divine is established immediately.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
η πωϲ δυναται τιϲ ειϲελθιν ειϲ την οικιαν του ϊϲχυρου και τα ϲκευη αυ διαρπαϲαι ε μη πρωτον δηϲη τον ϊϲχυρ και τοτε την οικι αυτου διαρπα

**English Translation**
Or how can anyone enter into the house of the strong man and plunder his vessels, unless first he binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "strong man" holds the vessels in captivity, but a Stronger One has entered to bind him. The plundering mentioned here is a holy theft; it is the liberation of souls—the vessels—that were wrongly held in the house of the usurper. The binding is the necessary prerequisite for this salvation.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ο μη ων μετ εμου κατ εμου εϲτιν κ(αι) ο μη ϲυναγων με εμου ϲκορπιζι με

**English Translation**
He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters [me].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no middle ground in the economy of salvation. One either participates in the gathering work of the Christ or contributes to the scattering dissolution of the world. To claim neutrality is effectively to position oneself against the Gathering One.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
δια τουτο λεγω ϋ παϲα αμαρ και βλαϲφημι αφεθηϲετε τοιϲ η δε του βλαϲφημια ουκ αφεθηϲετε το

**English Translation**
Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to the [men]; but the blasphemy of the [Spirit] shall not be forgiven to the [men].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful distinction is drawn between general sin and the specific rejection of the Divine Spirit. While human failings are pardonable, the deliberate attribution of the Holy Spirit's work to the demonic closes the very door through which forgiveness enters. It is the rejection of the Remedy itself.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ εαν ειπη λο κατα του ϋϊου του α α αφεθη αυτω οϲ δ αν ειπη κατα του του αγιου ου μη ουκ ουκ αφεθηϲετε αυτω ουτε εν του τω αιωνι ουτε εν τω μελλοντι

**English Translation**
And whoever speaks a word against the Son of the [Man], it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy [Spirit], it shall not not not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the coming one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The threefold negation "not not not" emphasizes the absolute finality of this judgment. To speak against the humble appearance of the Son is a stumbling of ignorance; to recognize the Power of the Holy and name it evil is a corruption of the will that transcends the boundaries of this age and the age to come.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
η ποιηϲαται το δεν καλον και τ τ καρπον αυτου α α καλον η ποιηϲατε το δεν ϲαπρον και τον καρπον αυτου ϲαπρον εκ γαρ του καρπου το δενδρον γινω

**English Translation**
Either make the tree good and the the fruit of it good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten; for from the fruit the tree is known.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nature and works are inseparable. A corrupt essence cannot produce a sanctified result, nor can a good essence produce corruption. The fruit is not merely a product but a revelation of the tree's hidden reality; thus, the works of a man testify infallibly to the state of his heart.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
γεννημα γεννηματα εχιδν εχιδν πωϲ δυναϲθε αγα λαλιν πονηροι οντεϲ εκ γαρ του περιϲϲευματοϲ τηϲ καρδιαϲ το ϲτο λαλει

**English Translation**
Brood broods of vipers vipers, how are you able to speak good things, being evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition "broods broods" and "vipers vipers" intensifies the condemnation of their origin. Their inability to speak good is rooted in their being; the mouth is merely the servant of the heart's treasury. Speech is the overflow of the inner abundance, whether that abundance is grace or venom.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ο αγαθοϲ α α εκ του αγαθου θηϲαυ εκβαλλει τα αγαθα και ο πονη εκ του πονηρου θηϲαυ εκβαλλει πο

**English Translation**
The good man out of the good treasure casts forth the good things; and the evil man out of the evil treasure casts forth evil things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Man is a vessel containing a treasure, either of light or of darkness. The act of "casting forth" brings what is hidden into the open. The moral quality of the action is determined entirely by the source from which it is drawn—the internal storehouse of the soul.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
λεγω δε ϋμιν ο παν ρημα αργ αργ ο λαληϲουϲιν οι αποδωϲου δωϲουϲιν αποδωϲουϲιν περι αυτου λο εν ημερα κρι

**English Translation**
But I say to you that every idle idle word which the [men] shall speak, they shall render give render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The severity of the judgment extends even to the "idle idle" word—that which is workless or careless. Nothing is lost in the economy of God; even the seemingly insignificant utterances are recorded and must be accounted for when the final reckoning is rendered.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
εκ γαρ των λογων ϲου δικε και εκ τ τ λογων καταδικα ·

**English Translation**
For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tongue acts as the scale of the soul’s final judgment. Justification and condemnation are not merely consequences of deeds, but are inherent in the speech that flows from the heart. The twofold repetition of "words" establishes the certainty that speech is the primary evidence in the divine court.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
τοτε απε αυτω τι των γραμμα και φαριϲε λεγοντεϲ δι θελομ απο ϲου ϲημιον ϊδιν

**English Translation**
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Those who pride themselves on the law approach with a demand for visual proof, betraying their spiritual blindness. They address him as Teacher, yet they refuse to learn from his doctrine, insisting instead on subjecting the divine power to the scrutiny of their own eyes. The desire to "see" a sign reveals a refusal to believe the truth already present.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθιϲ ει αυτοιϲ γενε πονηρα και μοι ϲημιον επι και ϲημιον ου δοθηϲετε αυτη ει μη το ϲημιον ϊωνα του προφη

**English Translation**
But he answering said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, and a sign will not be given to it, except the sign of Jonas the prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This generation is called adulterous because it has forsaken its covenant with God to chase after wonders. No spectacle will be granted to satisfy their curiosity; only the sign of Jonas is offered. This sign points not to a display in the heavens, but to the mystery of descent and the prophetic reality of resurrection.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
ωϲπερ γαρ ην ϊωναϲ εν τη κοι του κητουϲ τριϲ ημεραϲ και τριϲ νυκταϲ ουτωϲ ε ο του εν τη καρδια τηϲ γηϲ τριϲ ημεραϲ και νυκταϲ

**English Translation**
For just as Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and nights.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The descent into the whale's belly prefigures the descent of the Son of Man into the heart of the earth. The precise numbering of days and nights confirms the reality of the burial and the completeness of the mystery. As Jonas emerged from the depths, so the Son of Man shall overcome the earth that swallows him.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
ανδρεϲ νινευειτε αναϲτηϲοντε τη κριϲι μετα τηϲ γενεαϲ ταυτηϲ και κατακρινουϲ αυτην οτι μετε ειϲ το κη ϊωνα και ϊδου πλειον ϊω ωδε

**English Translation**
Men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonas, and behold, something greater than Jonas is here.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The men of Nineveh serve as witnesses against the hardness of the present age. They repented at the voice of a servant, Jonas, without demanding further proofs. The condemnation arises because the one currently present is far greater than the prophet, yet this generation refuses the repentance that the Ninevites embraced.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
βαϲιλιϲ νοτου εγερθη εν τη κριϲει μετα τηϲ γενεαϲ ταυτηϲ και κατα αυτην οτι ηλθεν εκ των πε τηϲ γηϲ α την ϲοφι ϲολομωνοϲ και ϊδου πλειον ϲολομωνοϲ ω

**English Translation**
The Queen of the South will be raised in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Queen of the South undertook a great labor, traveling from the ends of the earth, solely to hear human wisdom from Solomon. Her zeal condemns those who, having the very Source of wisdom in their midst, remain sluggish and unbelieving. The presence of the "greater" one demands a greater response than she gave to the king.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
οταν δε το ακαθαρ εξελθη απο του διερ δι ανυδρων τοπων ζητουν ζητων ζητουν αναπαυϲιν και ου ευριϲκει

**English Translation**
But when the unclean [spirit] has gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places, seeking, seeking, seeking rest, and does not find it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The expelled spirit wanders in dry, waterless places, which signifies a deprivation of divine grace and life. The text’s stuttering repetition of "seeking" exposes the relentless, restless malice of the unclean one. It finds no repose in the wilderness, for its only desire is the destruction of the human vessel.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγι ειϲ τον οικ μου επιϲτρεψω οθεν εξηλθον κ(αι) ελ και ευριϲκει ϲχο και ϲεϲα και κε

**English Translation**
Then it says, Into my house I will return, whence I came out; and coming, it finds it empty and swept and adorned.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demon arrogantly claims the human soul as "my house." It finds the soul swept and adorned with external morality or temporary cleansing, yet dangerously empty. Because the space is unoccupied by the Spirit of God, the very orderliness of the house becomes an invitation for the enemy’s return.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
τοτε πορευετε κ(αι) παραλαμβανι με εαυτου επτα ετε πονηρο εαυτου και ειϲ κατοι εκι και γινετε τα εϲχατα του α εκινου χιρονα των πρωτων ουτωϲ εϲτε και τη γενεα ταυτη τη πονηρα

**English Translation**
Then it goes and takes with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and entering, dwells there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The number seven indicates a totality of wickedness rushing to fill the void left by half-hearted religion. The relapse is catastrophic, making the man's final state far worse than his original corruption. This serves as a warning to the generation that witnesses power but fails to be filled with the Holy Spirit; their emptiness invites a multiplied judgment.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
ετι αυτου λαλουντοϲ τοιϲ οχλοιϲ ϊδου η μητηρ και οι αδελφοι αυτου αυτου ϊϲτηκιϲαν εξω ζητουντεϲ αυτω λαληϲαι

**English Translation**
While he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the Word is being sown among the crowds, those bound by fleshly kinship stand outside. They seek a conversation based on earthly ties, yet they are separated from the spiritual instruction occurring within. The repetition of "his" emphasizes the intensity of this natural bond which now presses against the boundaries of his mission.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε τιϲ των μαθητων αυτου ϊδου η ϲου και οι αδελφοι ϲου εξω ζητουϲιν ϲε

**English Translation**
And one of his disciples said, Behold, your [mother] and your brothers seek you outside.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A disciple attempts to interrupt the divine discourse with news of earthly relations. By announcing the mother and brothers, the disciple directs attention away from the eternal teaching to the temporal family standing without. The disciple perceives the physical obligation, not yet understanding the higher order of spiritual affinity.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
ο δε αποκριθειϲ ειπεν τω λεγον αυτω τιϲ εϲτ η μου και τι ειϲιν οι αδελ μου

**English Translation**
But he answering said to the one telling him, Who is my [mother] and who are my brothers?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He responds by questioning the very foundation of natural kinship. By asking "Who is my mother," he prepares to redefine family not by bloodlines, which are temporary, but by obedience to the Father. He does not deny his birth, but subordinates the flesh to the Spirit, inviting the hearer to a higher lineage.

**Verse 49**
**Greek Text**
και εκτι την χιρα αυτου χιραν̣ επι τουϲ μαθη αυτου ειπεν ϊδου η μου και οι αδελφοι μου

**English Translation**
And stretching out his hand [hand] towards his disciples he said: Behold the [mother] of me and the brothers of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord extends His hand to transfer the dignity of His lineage to those who learn from Him. By gesturing to the disciples and proclaiming "Behold the [mother] of me," He elevates the faithful to the highest station of intimacy, using the feminine article to signify that the spiritual bond fulfills the maternal role. The inclusion of "brothers" confirms that the assembly of disciples forms a complete family unit, defined not by blood but by their proximity to the Word.

**Verse 50**
**Greek Text**
οϲτιϲ γαρ αν ποι το θελημα του μου του ε αυτοϲ μου αδελφοϲ κ(αι) αδελφη και εϲτιν

**English Translation**
For whoever does the will of the [Father] of me, of the [one] in [heaven], he is my brother and sister and is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Kinship in the Kingdom is established solely by obedience to the divine will. The text identifies the doer of this will as "brother and sister," explicitly embracing both genders in this holy adoption. The verse concludes abruptly with "and is," a powerful assertion of being; it signifies that the one who acts in accordance with the will of the Father exists fundamentally and undeniably as the kin of Christ, requiring no further title to validate their standing.
