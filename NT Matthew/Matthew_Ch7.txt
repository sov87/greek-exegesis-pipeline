**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
μη κρινεται ϊνα μη κριθητε

**English Translation**
Judge not, that you be not judged.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prohibition halts the usurpation of the divine prerogative. By suspending the critical sentence against the neighbor, the soul closes the tribunal against itself. The command is absolute to ensure safety from the final decree.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
εν ω γαρ κριματι κρινε κριθηϲεϲθαι και εν ω μετρω μετριται μετρη ϋμιν ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
For with what judgment judge [ye], [ye] shall be judged; and with what measure is measured, [it] measures to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The standard established by the heart returns upon the head. The judgment actively employed becomes the passive sentence received. The measure used to limit charity determines the portion returned to the giver.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
τι δε βλεπιϲ το καρ το εν τω ο του αδελ ϲου την δε δο την εν τω ϲω οφθαλμω εν τω ϲω οφθαλμω δοκον ου κα

**English Translation**
And why lookest thou at the [speck] that [is] in the [eye] of thy [brother], but the [beam], the [beam] in thy eye, in thy eye [a beam], not [perceivest]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vision is distorted by the obstruction within. Attention fixes upon the minute fault of the brother while ignoring the massive impediment in one's own sight. The repetition of the beam in the eye emphasizes the magnitude of this blindness.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
η πωϲ λεγιϲ εριϲ εριϲ τω αδελφω ϲου αδελφε αφεϲ εκβαλω το καρφοϲ εκ του οφθαλμου ϲου και ϊδου η δο εν τω οφθαλ ϲου

**English Translation**
Or how sayest... wilt thou say, wilt thou say to thy brother: Brother, let me cast out the speck from thy eye; and behold, the [beam] [is] in thy [eye]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hypocrisy manifests in the speech. To offer surgical aid while possessing a blinded eye is presumption. The claim to clear the vision of the brother is negated by the presence of the greater obstruction in the one offering help.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ϋποκριτα εκβαλε πρωτον εκ του οφθαλμου ϲου την δοκον και τοτε διαβλε εκβαλλειν το καρφοϲ εκ του ο του α ϲου ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Hypocrite, cast out first from thy eye the beam, and then [thou shalt see clearly] to cast out the speck from the [eye] of thy [brother].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Order is demanded for restoration. Purification of self precedes the correction of the neighbor. Only when the heavy timber is removed does the sight possess the clarity necessary for delicate extraction.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
μη δωτε το αγιον τοιϲ κυϲιν μηδε βαλητε τουϲ μαρ ϋμων εμπροϲθεν τ χοιρων μηποτε καταπατηϲωϲιν αυτουϲ εν τοιϲ πο αυτων και ϲτραφεντεϲ ρη ϋμαϲ

**English Translation**
Give not the holy thing to the dogs, nor cast your [pearls] before the swine, lest they trample them with their [feet], and turning [rend] you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Sacred mysteries require discernment. To offer the holy thing to those without understanding invites desecration and violence. The lack of appreciation in the recipient turns the precious gift into a cause for destruction.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
αιτειτε και δοθη ϋμιν ζητει και ευρηϲετε κρουεται και ανοι ϋμιν

**English Translation**
Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and [it] shall [be opened] to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is threefold, implying intensity and progression. The promise corresponds to the action: the gift to the petition, the discovery to the search, and the entrance to the persistent blow. The door yields to the one who acts.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
παϲ γαρ ο αιτων λαμ και ο ζητ ευριϲκει και τω κρουοντι ανοι :

**English Translation**
For everyone asking [receiveth], and the [one seeking] findeth, and to the one knocking [it is opened].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rule allows no exception. The nature of the seeker guarantees the result. Reception and discovery are the inevitable consequences of the spiritual motion toward the provider.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
η τιϲ ε εξ ϋμων αν ον εαν αιτη ο αυτου αρ μη λιθον ε αυτω

**English Translation**
Or what [man] is there of you, whom if his [son] ask [bread], will [give] him a stone?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The comparison rests on paternal instinct. Even nature dictates that a father responds to hunger with sustenance, not with useless matter. The stone cannot satisfy the need for bread.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
η και ϊχθυν αιτηϲι μη οφιν επιδω αυτω

**English Translation**
Or also [if] he asks a fish, will he give him a serpent?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The contrast sharpens from uselessness to danger. A father does not substitute nourishment with venom. The request for food does not provoke a harmful gift.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ει ουν ϋ πονηροι ον οιδαται δομα αγαθα διδοναι τοιϲ τεκνοιϲ ϋμ ποϲω μαλλον ο ϋμων ο εν τοιϲ ο δωϲει αγαθα τοιϲ αιτουϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
If therefore [ye], being evil, know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how much more [Father] yours who [is] in the [heavens] will give good things to those asking him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The argument proceeds from the lesser to the greater. If human nature, corrupted by evil, retains the capacity for benevolence toward offspring, the divine nature, which is pure goodness, exceeds this immeasurably. The heavenly Father's provision is certain for the suppliant.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
παντα ουν οϲα εαν θε ϊνα ποιωϲ ϋμειν ϋμ οι ου και ϋμιϲ ποι αυτοιϲ ουτοϲ γαρ εϲτιν ο νομοϲ και οι προφηται

**English Translation**
All things therefore whatsoever [ye] will that [men] should do to you, [ye] [the] [thus] also ye do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This command summarizes the entire scriptural instruction. The will concerning oneself becomes the rule of action toward the other. In this reciprocity, the fullness of the ancient requirements finds completion.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ειϲελθατε δια τηϲ ϲτενηϲ πυληϲ οτι πλατια η πυλη και ευ η οδοϲ η απαγουϲα ειϲ τ απωλιαν και πολ ειϲιν οι ειϲερχομε πορευομαιμενοι ειϲερχομενοι δι αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
Enter through the narrow gate, because wide is the gate and spacious the way leading to destruction, and many are the ones entering travelling entering through it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see here a command to enter through restriction, for the path to ruin is defined by its breadth. The text presents a chaotic clamor of movement—entering, travelling, entering—illustrating the confused rush of the multitude. They do not merely pass; they are caught in a cycle of motion that leads only to destruction, crowded by the very width that invited them.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
οτι τι τι ϲτενη η πυλη και τεθλιμμενη η οδοϲ η απαγου ειϲ την ζωην και ολιγοι ειϲιν οι ευριϲκοντεϲ αυ :

**English Translation**
Because what what narrow is the gate and pressed is the way leading to life, and few are the ones finding it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering interrogation "what what" draws our mind to the peculiar nature of this narrowness; it is a thing to be marveled at and searched out. The way is not merely small but pressed, afflicted by pressure, demanding resilience from those who tread it. Only a few possess the vision to find this compressed entrance to life, for it is hidden from the gaze of the comfortable.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
προϲεχεται απο των ψευδοπρο οιτινεϲ ερχονται προϲ ϋ εν ενδυμα προβατων εϲω δε ειϲιν λυ αρπαγεϲ

**English Translation**
Take heed from the false prophets who come to you in clothings of sheep, but inside are ravenous wolves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We are warned to separate appearance from substance. The clothing of sheep is a disguise worn to gain proximity, for the danger lies not in what is seen but in the interior reality. The wolf does not announce its nature but hides it beneath the familiar, seeking to devour the flock from within the fold.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
απο των καρπων αυ επιγνωϲε αυτουϲ : μητι ϲυλλεγουϲιν απο ακανθων ϲτα η απο τρι ϲυκα

**English Translation**
From their fruits you will know them; do they gather from thorns grapes, or from thistles figs?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Recognition comes not from the leaf or the branch, but from the yield. It is an immutable law of creation that the sharp thorn cannot produce the sweet grape, nor the prickly thistle the fig. The nature of the plant restricts what it can offer; evil cannot generate the sustenance of good.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ουτω παν δενδρ αγαθον καρπουϲ καλουϲ ποιει το δε ϲαπρον δεν καρπουϲ πο ποιει :

**English Translation**
Thus every good tree makes beautiful fruits, but the rotten tree makes evil fruits.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Goodness is active and generative; the good tree is defined by the making of beauty. Conversely, the rotten tree is not merely idle but actively produces evil. The internal quality of the tree, whether sound or decayed, is inevitably made manifest in the work it brings forth.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ου δυναται δενδρον · αγαθον καρπουϲ πονηρουϲ ποιειν ουδε δενδρον ϲα καρπουϲ κα ενεγκειν ποιειν ποιειν

**English Translation**
A good tree is not able to make evil fruits, nor a rotten tree to bear make make beautiful fruits.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Capacity is bound by nature. A good tree possesses no power to generate evil, just as a rotten tree struggles in vain—to bear, to make, to make—yet cannot produce beauty. The repetition emphasizes the futility of the corrupt attempting to mimic the creative act of the good; the will cannot overcome the rot of the root.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
παν δενδρον μη ποιουν καρπον καλον εκκοπτε και ειϲ πυρ βαλ

**English Translation**
Every tree not making beautiful fruit is cut down and thrown into fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Existence without the production of beauty warrants destruction. The tree is not spared for its leaves or its shade; if it fails in the specific task of making beautiful fruit, it is severed from the earth. The fire is the final recipient of that which occupied space without fulfilling its purpose.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
αρα γε απο των καρπων αυ επιγνωϲε αυτουϲ :

**English Translation**
Therefore indeed from their fruits you will know them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The conclusion is certain. We are not to judge by the height of the tree or the spread of its branches, but solely by the fruit. This is the definitive test of identity, stripping away all pretenses to reveal the true source.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ου παϲ ο λεγων μοι ειϲελευ ειϲ την βα των ουρα αλλ ο ποι τα θεληματα το θελημα του μου του εν τοιϲ ο

**English Translation**
Not everyone saying to me will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the wills the will of my [Father] in the heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Verbal acknowledgment is insufficient for entry into the kingdom. The text corrects itself from plural "wills" to the singular "will," focusing our attention on the one, unified desire of the one in the heavens. Salvation is found not in the multitude of human intentions, but in the doing of this singular, divine will.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
πολλοι ερουϲιν μοι εν εκεινη τη ημερα ου τω ϲω ονοματι επρο και τω ϲω ονοματι δε πολλα εξε εξεβαλομεν και τω ϲω ονοματι δυ πολλαϲ ε

**English Translation**
Many will say to me in that day, "Not in your name did we prophesy, and in your name cast out cast out demons, and in your name did many powers?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The plea of the many rests on their use of the Name for spectacular works—prophecy, the repeated casting out of demons, and powers. They rely on the utility of the Name rather than relation to the Person. Their defense is their activity, listing their deeds as if the power originated in their own merit.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και τοτε ομολογηϲω αυτοιϲ οτι ουδεπο εγνων ϋμαϲ αποχωρειτε απ ε οι εργαζομε την ανομιαν

**English Translation**
And then I will confess to them that I never knew you; depart from me, the ones working lawlessness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment is a confession of estrangement. Despite their mighty works, there was no knowledge, no intimacy between the Lord and the workers. Their labor, though miraculous in appearance, is revealed as lawlessness because it was performed in separation from the source of law.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
παϲ ουν οϲτιϲ α μου τουϲ λο τουτουϲ και ποιει αυτουϲ ομοι ανδρι φρονιμω οϲτιϲ ωκοδομηϲεν αυ την οικιαν ε την πετραν

**English Translation**
Every one therefore who hears my words these and does them will be likened to a prudent man who built his house upon the rock.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Prudence is defined by the union of hearing and doing. The house stands not because of its beauty, but because of its foundation upon the rock. To build upon the words heard is to anchor one's life in stability, immune to the shifting sands of mere opinion or appearance.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και κατεβη η βροχη και ηλθον οι ποτα και επνευϲ οι ανεμοι και προϲ προϲεπεϲαν τη οικι εκινη και ουκ ε τεθεμε γαρ επι τ πετραν

**English Translation**
And the rain came down and the rive[rs] came and the winds blew and fell upon fell upon that hous[e] and [it did] not [fall]; for it was found[ed] upon t[he] rock.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The assault upon the house is threefold: rain from above, rivers from below, and winds across the face of the earth. The text doubles the strike against the structure ("fell upon fell upon"), indicating the ferocity of the trial that besieges the faithful soul. Yet, the negation is absolute; it did not succumb. The stability is not found in the house itself but in that which lies beneath it. It was founded upon the rock, and this foundation renders the violence of the elements futile.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
και παϲ και παϲ ο ακουων μου τουϲ λογουϲ του και μη ποι αυτουϲ ομοιωθη ανδρι μωρω οϲτιϲ ωκοδομη αυτου την οι επι την αμ ψαμμον αμμον

**English Translation**
And every and every [one] hearing my words [of] the[se] and not do[ing] them shall be likened to a foolish man who built his hous[e] upon the sa[nd] sand sand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition "and every and every" establishes a universal scope; no one who hears is exempt from the necessity of action. Mere hearing without doing creates a likeness to folly. The man builds, exerting labor, yet he chooses a base of "sand sand sand." The text emphasizes the granular instability of his foundation through this repetition. He constructs a dwelling place for his soul upon a substance that shifts and divides, ensuring his labor leads only to ruin.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και κατεβη η βροχη και ηλθ οι ποταμοι και επνευϲαν οι ανεμοι επνευϲαν οι ανεμοι κ(αι) προϲεκοψαν τη ︴ οικια εκινη και ε και ην η πτω αυτηϲ μεγαλη

**English Translation**
And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew the winds blew and struck against that house and [it fell] and the fal[l] of it was great.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the winds blow twice, signifying a relentless, redoubled persecution of the spirit. Unlike the house on the rock which withstood the falling upon, this house is struck and immediately overcome. The collapse is total. The text marks the event as a "great fall," signifying that the ruin of a soul which knows the words but refuses the works is a catastrophe of immense magnitude, severing it from the stability of truth.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και εγενετο οτε ετε ο τουϲ λο τουτουϲ εξε εξεπληϲϲοντο επι τη διδαχη αυτου οι ο οι οχλοι επι τη διδαχη αυτου οι οχλοι επι τη διδαχη αυτου

**English Translation**
And it came to pass when [he] ended these word[s] they were aston[ished] astonished at his teaching the the the crowds at his teaching the crowds at his teaching.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The conclusion of the words brings about a profound reaction. The crowds are not merely surprised; they are thoroughly astonished, a state emphasized by the stuttering repetition of their reaction. The text cycles three times through "at his teaching," encircling the multitude in the doctrine. The teaching holds them captive, echoing in their ears and hearts, distinguishing the divine utterance from mere human speech.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ην γαρ διδαϲ αυτουϲ ωϲ ε εχων και ουχ ωϲ οι γραμμα αυτων

**English Translation**
For he was teach[ing] them as [one] hav[ing] having and not as their scrib[es].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority is intrinsic to the Teacher. He teaches "as having," possessing the power and truth within His own nature, not deriving it from external sources or traditions. This stands in stark contrast to the scribes, whose authority is borrowed or absent. He holds the power of the word; they merely transcribe it. The distinction confirms that the source of the rock mentioned previously is the very one now speaking with authority.
