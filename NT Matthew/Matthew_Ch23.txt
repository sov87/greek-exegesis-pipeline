**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ο ελαληϲεν τοιϲ οχλοιϲ και τοιϲ μαθητεϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου

**English Translation**
Then he spoke to the crowds and to his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Speaker does not address the rulers of the temple alone, but turns to the multitude and those who follow him. By joining the crowds with the disciples, he indicates that the warning regarding authority is necessary for both the simple believer and the committed servant. The distinction between the many and the few dissolves under the weight of the instruction; all must hear the judgment pronounced against empty religion.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
λεγων · επι τηϲ μωϋϲεωϲ καθεδραϲ εκαθιϲ οι γραμματειϲ και οι φαριϲεοι

**English Translation**
saying: Upon the seat of Moses sat the scribes and the Pharisees.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He acknowledges the seat of Moses, validating the structure of the law even while preparing to dismantle the pride of its occupants. The authority resides in the chair—the tradition and the law—rather than in the men who have taken their place upon it. They sat themselves down, claiming succession, yet the validity of the seat does not sanctify the corruption of the sitter.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
παντα ουν οϲα εαν ειπω ϋμιν ποιηϲα ποιηϲατε κ(αι) τηρειτε ποιηϲατε κ(αι) τηρειτε κατα δε τα εργα αυ μη ποιειτε λεγουϲιν γαρ και ου ποιουϲιν

**English Translation**
Therefore all things whatsoever they might say to you, do, do ye and keep, do ye and keep; but according to their works do not; for they say and do not do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is repetitive and urgent: preserve the law they speak, for the words are not theirs but belong to the history of the covenant. Obedience is owed to the truth they accidentally utter, yet a sharp severance is made between their speech and their action. The believer must become a sifter of wheat, retaining the verbal instruction of the law while rejecting the barren example of the hypocrite.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
δεϲμευ δε φορτια με βαρεα και επι επι τουϲ ω των ανων αυτοι δε τω δακτυ αυτων ου θε κινηϲε αυ

**English Translation**
And they bind burdens [indeed] heavy and [place them] upon, upon the shoulders of the men; but they themselves with their finger do not wish to move them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the asymmetry of legalism: they construct a weight that they refuse to carry. The law, in their hands, becomes a mechanism of oppression against the shoulders of men, rather than a path to righteousness. Their refusal to move even a finger exposes a theology devoid of mercy; they are architects of a heaviness they themselves despise.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
παντα δε τα εργα αυ ποιουϲιν προϲ το θεαθηνε τοιϲ πλατυνουϲι γαρ τα φυλακτηρι αυτων και μεγα τα κραϲπε

**English Translation**
But all their works they do to be seen by the [men]; for they widen their phylacteries and enlarge the fringes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Piety is transmuted into performance. The widening of the phylactery and the enlargement of the fringe serve no divine purpose but act as a theater for the eyes of men. When the exterior signs of devotion expand, it is often to compensate for the shrinking of the interior spirit. They seek the gaze of the creature rather than the approval of the Creator.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
φιλουϲι δε την πρωτοκλιϲιαν ταϲ πρωτοκλιϲιαϲ τοιϲ διπνοιϲ και ταϲ πρωτοκα εν τεϲ ϲυ ταιϲ ϲυναγωγαιϲ ταιϲ ϲυναγωγεϲ

**English Translation**
And they love the first couch [first couches] at the suppers and the first seats in the synagogues.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Their love is misplaced, fixed upon the geography of honor rather than the location of the heart. Whether at the common meal or in the house of assembly, they maneuver for the position that signals superiority. The synagogue, intended for the humbling of the soul before the Law, becomes the stage for their ambition.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
και τουϲ αϲπαϲμουϲ εν τεϲ αγορεϲ ταιϲ αγοραιϲ και καλειϲθε ϋπο των α ραββει

**English Translation**
and the greetings in the markets and to be called by the men Rabbi.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They thirst for the acoustic affirmation of their status in the public square. The title "Rabbi" is consumed not as a description of function but as a nutrient for pride. By demanding this recognition in the markets, they drag the sacred role of teaching into the commerce of vanity, trading instruction for applause.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ δε μη κληθητε ραββει ειϲ γαρ εϲτιν ϋμ ο καθηγητηϲ διδαϲκαλοϲ καθηγητηϲ παντεϲ δε ϋμιϲ α εϲτε

**English Translation**
But ye, be not called Rabbi; for one is your Guide, Teacher, Guide, and all ye are brothers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hierarchy of the world is flattened within the community of the faithful. By forbidding the title, he removes the barrier between the learner and the learned, reminding them that the source of instruction is singular and divine. The repetition of "Guide" and "Teacher" emphasizes that no human usurper can claim the chair of the true Master; among the disciples, brotherhood is the only valid rank.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και μη καλεϲη ϋμων επι τηϲ γηϲ ειϲ γαρ εϲτιν ϋμ ο ο ουρανιοϲ

**English Translation**
And call not [anyone] yours on the earth; for one is your [Father], the heavenly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ultimate paternity is transferred from the soil to the heavens. To attach the primary title of "Father" to a man on earth is to obscure the origin of life and spirit. The believer is defined not by earthly lineage or patronage but by a vertical relationship with the Heavenly One, rendering all earthly authority relative and subordinate.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
μηδε κληθητε κα ειϲ γαρ εϲ ϋμων ο καθη ο

**English Translation**
Neither be ye called [guides]; for one is your Guide, the [One].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prohibition is reiterated to strip away the pretense of spiritual leadership. We are not the pathmakers but the followers. There is but one Guide who leads the soul, and to claim this title is to obscure the singular direction provided by the Divine. The text leaves the identity suspended in the article "the [One]," pointing to a singular, unspoken authority that tolerates no rival.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ο δε μιζων εϲται διακονοϲ

**English Translation**
But the greater shall be a servant.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the inversion of the Pharisaic order. Greatness is not found in the seat of Moses, the first couch, or the greeting in the market, but in the unseen labor of the servant. The definition of power is rewritten: it is no longer the capacity to compel others, but the capacity to serve them.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
οϲτιϲ δε ϋψωϲει εαυτον ταπινω και οϲτιϲ ταπινωϲει εαυτ ϋψωθηϲετε

**English Translation**
But whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the immutable physics of the spiritual realm. Self-elevation inevitably triggers a divine lowering, while voluntary descent invites divine ascension. The mechanism of glory is paradox; one rises only by bowing low, and the architecture of pride is dismantled by the very act of its construction.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ουαι δε γραμμα και φαριϲαιοι ϋποκριτε οτι κλιε την βαϲιλιαν των ουρανων εμ των ϋμειϲ γαρ ουκ ιϲερ ειϲερχεϲθε ουδε τουϲ ει α ειϲελθειν

**English Translation**
Woe [to you], scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye shut the kingdom of the heavens before [men]; for ye do not enter, nor those entering do ye [allow] to enter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribes and Pharisees stand as gatekeepers who have become obstacles. By shutting the kingdom, they commit a double iniquity: they refuse the divine invitation themselves and actively hinder the salvation of others. Their hypocrisy lies in holding the position of entrance-keepers while effectively bolting the doors against the faithful.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν γραμμα και φαριϲαιοι ϋ οτι περι την θαλαϲϲ και την ξηραν ποι ενα προϲηλυ και οταν γενη ποιειτε αυτον γεεννηϲ διπλο ϋμων

**English Translation**
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye go about the sea and the dry [land] to make one proselyte, and whenever he becomes [one], ye make him [a son] of Gehenna twofold more than you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Great zeal is expended to traverse sea and land for a single convert, yet the result is ruin. The convert, molded by hypocrites, absorbs their errors with such intensity that his condemnation exceeds that of his teachers. It is a sterile labor that produces only a doubled inheritance of Gehenna.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ουαι υμιν οδηγοι οι τυφλοι οι λεγοντεϲ οϲ αν ομοϲη εν τω ναω ουδεν εϲτ οϲ δ αν ομοϲη εν τω χρυϲω του ναου ὁφιλει

**English Translation**
Woe to you, blind guides, who say: Whosoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever swears by the gold of the temple, he owes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
These blind guides invert the spiritual order, valuing the material gold above the sacred dwelling. They teach that an oath by the sanctuary is void, but an oath by the treasure binds the soul. This is the theology of merchants, not priests, measuring sanctity by wealth rather than divine presence.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
μωροι και τυφλοι τιϲ γαρ μι εϲτιν ο χρυ η ο ναοϲ ο αγι τον χρυϲον

**English Translation**
Fools and blind; for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The greater reality is that which confers holiness, not that which receives it. The gold has no sanctity in itself but draws it entirely from the temple. To esteem the gold above the temple is to worship the effect while despising the cause.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
και οϲ αν ομοϲη εν τω θυϲιαϲτη ουδεν εϲτιν οϲ δ αν ομοϲη εν τω δωρω τω επα αυτου οφιλι ·

**English Translation**
And: Whosoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever swears by the gift upon it, he owes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the error is repeated regarding the altar and the gift. The hypocrites bind the conscience to the offering, which is of human origin, while dismissing the altar, which is the seat of divine acceptance. They see value only in what is given by men, ignoring the structure ordained by God.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
τυφλοι τι γαρ μιζ το δωρον · η το θυ το αγι το δωρον

**English Translation**
Blind; for which is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifies the gift?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Blindness prevents them from seeing that the altar is the source of the gift's holiness. A gift not placed upon the altar remains common; it is the altar that elevates the offering. By prioritizing the gift, they honor the oblation of man above the consecration of God.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ο ουν ομοϲαϲ εν τω θυϲιαϲτηριω ομνυϊ εν αυτω κ(αι) εν παϲι τοιϲ επανω αυτου

**English Translation**
Therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by all things upon it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
An oath cannot be dissected. To touch the altar with one's word is to touch everything offering rests upon it. The sacred object acts as a unity; one cannot isolate the stone from the sacrifice, for the oath binds the swearer to the entire reality of the altar.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
και ο ομοϲαϲ εν τω ναω ομνυει εν αυ και εν τω κατοι αυτον

**English Translation**
And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by Him who dwells in it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The temple is not merely a building but a habitation. To swear by the house is to invoke the Resident. There is no empty holiness; the sanctity of the temple is the presence of Him who dwells within, and thus every oath by the temple is a direct appeal to Him.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ο ομοϲαϲ εν τω ομνυ εν τω θρονω του και εν τω καθη επανω αυτου

**English Translation**
And he who swears by the [heaven] swears by the throne of [God] and by Him sitting upon it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The progression of the oath ascends from the earthly shadow to the heavenly reality. To swear by heaven is no escape from divine scrutiny, for heaven is the throne, and the throne implies the King. All oaths ultimately terminate in the authority of Him who sits upon the throne.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν γραμμα και φαριϲαιοι ϋ οτι απο το ηδυ και το ανη και το κυμιν και αφηκατε τα βα του νομου την κριϲιν και το ελεοϲ και την πι ταυτα εδει ποι κακινα μη α

**English Translation**
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye [tithe] the mint and the dill and the cumin, and have left the weightier matters of the law: judgment and mercy and faith; these things it was necessary to do, and those not to leave [undone].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They exhibit a microscopic piety, measuring out herbs with precision, while abandoning the massive structural pillars of the law: judgment, mercy, and faith. True righteousness requires the heavy burden of justice and charity alongside the lighter observances. To discard the weightier matters renders the meticulous tithing of spices an act of empty formalism.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
οδηγοι τυφλοι οι οι διϋλιζοντεϲ τον κωνωπα την δε καμηλον καταπι

**English Translation**
Blind guides, who strain out the gnat, but swallow the camel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This vivid image exposes the absurdity of their legalism. They filter their drink to avoid the smallest unclean insect, yet in their moral life, they ingest the largest of unclean beasts without hesitation. They are scrupulous in trifles but ravenous in great sins.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν γραμμα και φαριϲεοι ϋ οτι καθα το εξωθ του ποτηριου κε τηϲ παροψιδοϲ εϲωθεν δε γεμου εξ αρπαγηϲ κε και ακραϲιαϲ

**English Translation**
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of rapine and incontinence.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vessel appears distinct and pure to the eye, but the contents are vile. They polish the exterior life for the praise of men, while the interior life is filled with the violence of rapine and the chaos of incontinence. God looks not at the gleaming cup, but at the poison within.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
φαριϲαιε τυφλε καθαριϲον πρωτ πρωτ το εντοϲ του ποτη και τηϲ παροψι ϊνα γενηται κε και το εντοϲ εκτοϲ αυτ καθαρον

**English Translation**
Blind Pharisee, clean first first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that also the inside outside of it may become clean.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of the command to clean "first first" signals the supreme urgency of internal purification. The text unites the "inside outside," indicating that true exterior purity is not a separate act but a necessary consequence of the inward cleansing of the heart.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν γραμμα και κε φαριϲεοι ϋ οτι παρο ταφοιϲ κεκονιαμενοιϲ οιτινεϲ εξωθεν μεν φε ωρεοι ε δε γεμου οϲτεων νε κε και παϲηϲ α

**English Translation**
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you resemble whitewashed tombs, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but inside are full of bones of dead men and of all uncleanness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The adornment of the tomb conceals the reality of death, just as the outward piety of the hypocrite masks spiritual corruption. The beauty is a deception, for the substance within is not merely empty, but actively filled with the remnants of death and uncleanness.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ κε και ϋμιϲ εξωθ μεν φενεϲθε τοιϲ α δικεοι δικαιοι εϲω δε εϲτε μεϲ με μεϲ ϋποκριϲεωϲ κε ανομιαϲ

**English Translation**
Thus also you outwardly indeed appear to men righteous, but inside you are full full full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The triple assertion of fullness ("full full full") emphasizes the absolute saturation of the inner man with iniquity. While the eyes of men perceive righteousness, the interior reality is entirely occupied by lawlessness, leaving no room for the Spirit.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ουαι ϋμιν γραμμα και φαριϲεοι φαριϲαιοι ϋ οτι οικο τουϲ τα των προφη και κοϲμιτε τα μνημια των δικεων δικαιων

**English Translation**
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They honor the prophets with stones but reject their words. It is a sterile piety that reveres the dead righteous while remaining hostile to the living truth they proclaimed.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και λεγε ει ημεθα εν τεϲ ημερεϲ ταιϲ ημεραιϲ τ ημων ου αν ημεθα κοι αυτων εν τω αιματι τ προφητων

**English Translation**
And say: If we were in the days of our fathers, we would not be partners with them in the blood of the prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Self-justification blinds the conscience. By judging the fathers, they falsely elevate themselves, yet their actions prove they share the same murderous lineage and spirit as those they condemn.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ωϲ μαρτυριτε εαυ οτι ϋϊοι εϲτε των φονευϲαντ τουϲ προφηταϲ

**English Translation**
So that you testify against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To claim the title of son is to acknowledge the inheritance of the nature. By confessing their lineage, they inadvertently confess their predisposition to the very crime of murder that defined their ancestors.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) υ̇μιϲ πληρωϲατε το μετρον των πα ϋμων

**English Translation**
And you, fill up the measure of your fathers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is a command of judgment, surrendering the sinner to the completion of his iniquity. The fathers began the work of rebellion, and the sons are permitted to bring that measure to its terrible fullness.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
οφιϲ γεννηματα εχιδνων πωϲ φυγητε απο τηϲ κριϲεωϲ τηϲ ωᵨ γεεννηϲ

**English Translation**
Serpents, offspring of vipers, how shall you flee from the judgment of Gehenna?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The nature of the viper is fixed in venom and malice. The question posits the impossibility of escape; those who retain the nature of the serpent must inevitably face the judgment prepared for such corruption.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
δια τουτο ϊδου εγω αποϲτελλω προϲ ϋ προφηταϲ και ϲοφουϲ και γραμ εξ αυτων αποκτενιτε και ϲταυρωϲετε εξ αυ και κ(αι) εξ αυτων μαϲτιγω εν τεϲ ταιϲ ϲυνα ϋμων και διωξετε απο πο ειϲ πολιν

**English Translation**
Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Speaker reveals Himself as the Sender of all wisdom and prophecy. The reception of these messengers with killing, crucifixion, and scourging in the holy places demonstrates the total rejection of the Sender by those who claim to serve God.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
ο αν αν ελθη εφ υ παν παν αιμα δικεον δικαιον εκχυννομενον επι τηϲ γηϲ απο του αιματοϲ αβελʼ του δικαιου εωϲ του αιματοϲ ζαχαριου ϋϊου βαραχιου ον εφονευϲατε μεταξυ του ναου και του θυϲιαϲτη

**English Translation**
That might come upon you all the righteous blood poured out upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The guilt of history is cumulative. The murder committed in the sanctuary, between the temple and the altar, signifies the ultimate profanation, binding the present generation to the first bloodshed of Abel.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϋμιν ηξι ταυτα παντα επι την γενεαν ταυτην

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The solemn "Amen" confirms the inevitability of the decree. This generation, by completing the rebellion of the fathers, attracts to itself the full weight of the judgment accumulated throughout the ages.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
ι ι τουϲ προ αποκτενου η αποκτενουϲα τουϲ προφηταϲ η αποκτενουϲα τουϲ προφηταϲ και λιθοβολου τουϲ απεϲταλ προϲ αυ ποϲακιϲ ηθεληϲα επιϲυναγειν επιϲυναγαγειν τα τε ϲου ον τροπ ορνιϲ επιϲυναγι επιϲυναγει τα νοϲϲια αυτηϲ εαυτηϲ ϋπο ταϲ πτερυγαϲ και ουκ ηθεληϲα

**English Translation**
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets, the one killing the prophets, and stoning those sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children, in the manner a bird gathers her own chicks under the wings, and you did not desire it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of the city's name and its crime of "killing the prophets" underscores the depth of the tragedy. The divine will was to gather and protect with the tenderness of a bird for her chicks, yet the human will resisted, choosing destruction over the shelter of the wings.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
ϊδου αφιεται ϋ ο οικοϲ υμ ερημοϲ

**English Translation**
Behold, your house is left to you desolate.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "Behold" directs the gaze to the immediate consequence of rejecting the Prophets. The "house," once sanctified by the Divine presence, is now identified strictly as "your house," for the Lord no longer claims it as His own. To be "left" signifies the total withdrawal of the sustaining Spirit. What remains is "desolate," a structure standing in the void of abandonment, where the physical walls endure but the life within has departed.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
λεγω γαρ ϋμιν ου μη με ϊδητε απ αρ εωϲ αν ειπητε ευλογημενοϲ ο ερχομενοϲ εν ο

**English Translation**
For I say to you, you shall by no means see me from now until you say, Blessed is the one coming in [the] name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The withdrawal of the Lord initiates a spiritual blindness, for "you shall by no means see me" marks the cessation of divine vision. This darkness commences "from now" and persists until the heart aligns with the confession of the lips. The restoration of sight is conditional; it awaits the moment "you say" the words of welcome. Only by recognizing the "coming one" as "blessed" "in [the] name" is the separation bridged and the capacity to perceive the Lord restored.
