**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
ϊδων δε τουϲ ο ανεβη ειϲ το οροϲ και καθι αυτου προ προϲῆλθον αυτω οι μαθηται αυτου · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But seeing the [crowds], he went up into the mountain; and he having sat down, his disciples came to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ascent into the mountain separates the holy teaching from the lowlands of common noise, signifying that divine wisdom requires an elevation of the mind. By sitting, the Teacher assumes the posture of established authority, drawing the disciples upward to receive the law not on stone, but in the living presence of the Word.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ανοιξαϲ το ϲτο ἁυτου εδιδα αυτουϲ λεγ : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And opening his mouth he taught them, saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The opening of the mouth reveals the source of the new covenant, where the eternal Word articulates the mysteries of the kingdom. He teaches not merely by sign, but by the direct utterance of his own voice, imparting wisdom to those gathered to hear.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι οι πτω τω ὁτι αυ εϲτιν η βα βαϲιλε'ια των ο ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the poor in the [spirit], for theirs is the kingdom of the [heavens].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
True possession begins with emptiness; those who recognize their own spiritual destitution make room for the celestial reign. The kingdom is not conquered by strength but is the rightful property of those who possess nothing of themselves to claim it.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι οι πεν νυν οτι αυ παρακληθη · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the mourning [now], for they shall be comforted.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The grief experienced in this present moment acts as a precursor to divine solace. Sorrow is not a final state but a preparation for the Comforter to intervene, turning the current tears of the faithful into the evidence of future restoration.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι οι πρα ὁτι αυτοι κλη την γην ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Violence seizes land only to lose it, but meekness receives the earth as a lasting inheritance. The gentle spirit, unresisting and enduring, ultimately possesses the ground which the aggressive seek to dominate in vain.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι ὁι πιν και διψωντεϲ την δικαιοϲυν οτι αυτοι χορτα · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the hungering and thirsting [for] righteousness, for they shall be filled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A desperate appetite for justice is the mark of a living soul, distinct from the satiated stupor of the world. This holy craving guarantees satisfaction, for God does not leave the desire for holiness unanswered but fills it completely.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι ὁι ελε ὁτι αυ ελεηθηϲον ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The distribution of compassion to others secures a reciprocal divine harvest for oneself. One cannot demand pardon from the Judge without first extending that same pardon to the fellow servant.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι ὁι καθα τη καρ̣δια καρδια ὁτι αυτοι τον ο ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the pure in the heart, for they [shall see] the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vision of the Divine is reserved for the interior organ that has been cleansed of defilement. The repetition of the heart in the text emphasizes that the center of the being must be unmixed and singular to perceive the One who is holy.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι ὁι ϊρη οτι κληθηϲον · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the peacemakers, for [they] shall be called [sons of God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Those who actively construct peace participate in the family likeness of the Father. Their designation as sons is not merely a title but a calling that manifests their origin in the God of peace.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι οι δεδι ενεκ δικαιοϲυνηϲ ὁτι αυτων εϲτιν η βα βαϲιλε'ια των ουραν · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Blessed [are] the persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Persecution serves as the seal of ownership upon the citizens of the heavenly realm. Suffering for the sake of the right path confirms that one belongs not to the passing age, but to the eternal kingdom.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
μακαριοι εϲτε οτ ονειδιϲωϲιν και διωξου · και ειπωϲιν παν πονηρον κα υμων ψευδομε ενεκεν εμου ·

**English Translation**
Blessed are ye when [they] shall revile and persecute, and say every evil [thing] against you, lying, for my sake.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The assault of lies and reviling is transformed into a cause for blessing when endured for the Speaker's sake. The falsehoods of the accusers only highlight the truth of the disciple's fidelity to the One who sends them.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
χαιρεται και αγαλʼ ὁτι ο μι πολυϲ εν τοιϲ ο ου γαρ εδιωξαν τουϲ προφηταϲ τουϲ προ · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Rejoice and be glad, for the reward [is] great in the [heavens]; for thus they persecuted the prophets [who were] before.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Joy is commanded even in tribulation because the compensation stored in the heavens far outweighs earthly suffering. This path of persecution aligns the faithful with the ancient lineage of the prophets, validating their prophetic witness through shared endurance.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ὲϲτε το ἁλα ἁλαϲ ἁλα τηϲ γηϲ εαν δε το ἁλα μωρανθῆ εν τί ἁλιϲθηϲεται · ειϲ ουδεν ϊϲχυει ετι ει μη βληθεν εξω καταπατιϲθε των ανθρω · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Ye are the salt salt salt of the earth; but if the salt be grown insipid, in what shall it be salted? It prevails for nothing yet, except being cast out to be trampled of the men.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text preserves a threefold witness to the nature of the disciples, repeating "salt" to emphasize the intensity of the indwelling grace required to preserve the earth from corruption. The warning is stark: salt that loses its essential quality cannot be restored by any external means. Its end is not merely uselessness but total degradation, to be trodden under the feet of the men (`των ανθρω`) whom it was meant to season.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
εϲται το φωϲ του κοϲμου · ου δυ πολιϲ κρυ επανω ο κειμενη

**English Translation**
It shall be the light of the world; a city lying upon a [mountain] cannot be [hid].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The future tense "It shall be" points to the inevitable manifestation of this light; it is not merely a command but a prophetic certainty. As a city situated on a height (`επανω`) is exposed by its very elevation, so the community of the faithful cannot conceal its nature. The position confers both visibility and the impossibility of retreating into obscurity.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ου κεουϲιν λυχν ‾̷‾ και τιθεαϲιν αυ τον μοδι αλʼλʼ επι την λυ · και λαμπι παϲιν τοιϲ εν τη οικια

**English Translation**
Neither do they burn a lamp and place it under the bushel, but upon the lampstand; and it shines to all those in the house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act of kindling (`κεουϲιν`) implies a purpose of illumination which is negated by the bushel (`μοδι`). The lamp is not lit for its own sake but to serve the household (`οικια`). The proper placement upon the lampstand (`λυ`) is necessary for the light to fulfill its function, reaching all who dwell within the enclosure of the house.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ὁυτωϲ λαμ το φωϲ υ εμπροϲθ των α οπωϲ ἴδωϲιν τα καλα εργα και δοξαϲωϲιν τον τον εν τοιϲ ο · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Thus let the light of you shine before the [men], so that they might see the good works and glorify the [Father] the [one] in the [heavens].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The visibility of good works is not for the praise of the doer, but strictly strictly for the glorification of the source. The light belongs to you (`υ`), yet the glory is directed upward to the one in the [heavens] (`εν τοιϲ ο`). The works are the visible evidence that leads the observer from the earthly sight to the heavenly recognition.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
μη νομιϲητε ο ηλθον καταλυ τον νομον η τουϲ προφηταϲ ουκʼ ηλθον κατα αλʼλα πλη · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Do not suppose that I came to destroy the law or the prophets; I came not to destroy, but to fulfill.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no antagonism between the new arrival and the ancient deposit. The purpose is not dissolution (`καταλυ`) but completion (`πλη`). The law and the prophets are not discarded as rubble but are brought to their intended fullness, finding their perfect realization in the one who speaks.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
αμην γαρ λεγω ἑωϲ αν πα ὁ ουρανοϲ και ἡ γη ϊῶτα ε εν ἠ μία κεραια κερεα ου μη παρελθη απο του νομου ἑωϲ αν παντα γενηται · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
For amen I say, until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle tittle shall by no means pass away from the law, until all things happen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stability of the written law is anchored to the durability of the cosmos itself. Not even the slightest stroke (`κεραια`) is exempt from this endurance. The word binds the history of the world to the history of the text; the law remains operative in every minute detail until the final consummation of all events.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ὁϲ εαν ουν λυϲη μι των εντολ τουτων των ελα και διδα ουτωϲ τουϲ ελαχι κληθηϲετε εν τη βαϲιλια τ ο οϲ δʼ αν ποιηϲη κ(αι) διδαξη ουτοϲ μεγαϲ κληθηϲεται εν τη βαϲι των ουρανων

**English Translation**
Whosoever therefore shall loosen one of these least commandments and teach thus, shall be called least in the kingdom of the [heavens]; but whosoever shall do and teach, this one shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Greatness in the kingdom is defined by the coherence of action and instruction. To loosen (`λυϲη`) even the smallest command (`ελα`) and to catechize others in that laxity results in a diminished status (`ελαχι`). The integrity of "doing and teaching" (`ποιηϲη κ(αι) διδαξη`) preserves the whole law and secures a great rank in the heavenly order.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
λεγω γαρ ὁτι εαν μη περιϲϲευϲη η δικαιοϲυνη πλεον πλῖεον πλειον των γραμʼ και φα ου μη ει ειϲελθητε ειϲ την βαϲιλιαν των ου ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
For I say that if the righteousness abound not more more more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the [heavens].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The demand for a superior righteousness is urgent, emphasized by the triple repetition "more more more" (`πλεον πλῖεον πλειον`). It is insufficient to match the external observance of the scribes (`γραμ`) and Pharisees (`φα`); the disciple must possess an abundance that overflows the old measures to gain entrance into the kingdom.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
ηκουϲατε οτι ερʼ τοιϲ αρχαιοιϲ ου φονευϲειϲ ὁϲ δ αν φονευϲη ε εϲται τη κριϲει ·

**English Translation**
Ye heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shall not murder; and whosoever shall murder, liable shall he be to the judgment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ancient instruction limited the prohibition to the physical act of murder (`φονευϲειϲ`), binding the perpetrator to a forensic judgment (`κριϲει`). The hearing of the past focused on the external deed and its legal consequence, establishing a baseline of justice which is now to be transcended.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε λεγω ‾̷‾ ϋμιν οτι πᾶϲ ὁ ορ τω αδελφω ἁυτου εικη ενοχοϲ εϲτε τη κριϲει · οϲ δ αν εί τω αδελφω ἁυτου ραχα ρακα ενο εϲται τω ϲυ ˙ ὁϲ δʼ αν ειπη μωρε ενο εϲτε ειϲ την γεενʼναν του πυ · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But I say to you that everyone being angry with his brother without cause is liable to the judgment; and whosoever says to his brother, Racha Raka, liable shall he be to the council; and whosoever says, Fool, liable is he to the gehenna of the fire.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority of "But I say" internalizes the law. Anger (`ορ`) held without cause (`εικη`) incurs the same liability as the act of murder formerly did. The escalation of verbal contempt—from the stuttering insult "Racha Raka" to the charge of "Fool" (`μωρε`)—leads to an escalation of penalty, moving from the human council (`ϲυ`) to the final fire of Gehenna (`πυ`).

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
εαν ουν προϲφε το δωρον ϲου επι το θυϲιαϲτη κακει μνη ὁτι ὁ αδελ ϲου εχι τι κα ϲου ·

**English Translation**
If therefore thou offerest thy gift upon the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother has something against thee;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The approach to the holy altar (`θυϲιαϲτη`) provokes the conscience. The memory (`μνη`) of a broken relationship arrests the liturgy. It is not the worshipper's grievance, but the fact that the brother has something against him (`κα ϲου`), that creates the impediment to the offering.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
αφεϲ εκι το δωρον ϲου εμπρο του θυϲια · και πρωτον διαλʼλαγη τω αδελφω ϲου · και τοτε ελθων προϲφερε το δω ϲου · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Leave there thy gift before the altar, and first be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming, offer thy gift.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Reconciliation takes precedence over ritual oblation. The gift must be left suspended (`αφεϲ`) in the presence of the altar (`θυϲια`) while the worshipper seeks peace. Only after the restoration of brotherly unity (`διαλʼλαγη`) can the offering be presented, for the altar cannot sanctify a gift from a divided heart.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ϊϲθι ευνοων τω αντιδικω ϲου τα εωϲ ὅτου ει με αυτου εν τη οδω · μηποτε ϲε παρα ὁ αντίδικοϲ τω κριτη · και ὁ κρι τω ϋπηρετη και ειϲ φυλακην βληθηϲη ·

**English Translation**
Be well-minded to the adversary of you quickly while you are with him in the way; lest the adversary hand you over to the judge; and the judge to the servant and into prison you will be cast.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is for immediate benevolence while "in the way," signifying the transient duration of this life. Delay invokes a rigid juridical chain: the adversary delivers to the judge, and the judge to the servant. Once this sequence initiates, the agency of the accused vanishes, leaving only the certainty of the prison; reconciliation is the only escape from the inevitable operation of justice before the end.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
αμην λεγω ϲοι · ου μη εξελθηϲ εκι εωϲ απο τον εϲχατ κοδραντην ·

**English Translation**
Amen I say to you: You shall by no means come out from there until you pay back the last quadrans.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "Amen" ratifies the severity of the confinement. The debt is not merely general but calculated to the "last quadrans," indicating a justice that demands precise and total satisfaction. There is no release "from there" through mercy once the time of the way has ended; the liberation depends entirely on the exhaustion of the debt, a payment the prisoner can scarcely afford.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ηκουϲατε ὁτι ερ ου μοιχευϲιϲ ·

**English Translation**
You heard that it was said: You shall not commit adultery.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hearing pertains to the ancient prohibition, a law governing the external act. "It was said" points to a received tradition that addressed the deed of the body, setting a boundary against the physical violation of the marriage bond. This serves as the foundation upon which the deeper understanding of purity is about to be built.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε λεγω ὁτι παϲ ο βλεπ γυναικα προϲ το επιθυμηϲε αυτηϲ ηδη εμοιχευϲεν αυ εν τη καρδι ἁυτου

**English Translation**
But I say that everyone looking at a woman toward the [lusting] after her has already committed adultery with her in the heart of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority "I say" shifts the locus of judgment from the bed to the "heart." The eye that looks "toward" lust has already completed the sin within the inner man. The act is not required for the guilt to be established; the will and the desire constitute the adultery, rendering the heart impure even if the body remains untouched.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ει δε ο οφθαλμοϲ ϲου ὁ δεξιοϲ ϲκαν ϲε ἑξἑλε αυτον · και βαλε απο ϲου ϲυμφε γαρ ϲοι ἱνα απολη ἑν των μελ ϲου και μη ὁλον το ϲωμα ϲου βλη ειϲ γεενναν ·

**English Translation**
But if the eye of you, the right one, causes you to stumble, tear it out and cast [it] from you; for it is profitable to you that one of the members of you perish and not the whole body of you be cast into Gehenna.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "right eye," the most precious organ of sight, must be surrendered if it becomes a snare. The profit lies in the loss of a part to save the whole; it is better for a member to "perish" now—to cut off the avenue of visual temptation—than for the "whole body" to be engulfed in Gehenna. The physical integrity of the body is secondary to the eternal safety of the person.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
και ει ἡ δεξια ϲου χειρ ϲκανδαλιζι ϲε εκκοψον αυτ και βαλε απο ϲου · ϲυμφερι γαρ ϲοι ϊ απόληται ἑν τ μελων ϲου η κ(αι) μη ὁλον το ϲωμα ϲου ειϲ γε απελθη ·

**English Translation**
And if the right hand of you causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast [it] from you; for it is profitable to you that one of the members of you perish and not the whole body of you go away into Gehenna.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As with the eye, the "right hand"—the instrument of action and power—is subject to amputation if it leads to sin. The repetition reinforces the necessity of radical separation from the causes of stumbling. The destination "Gehenna" awaits the whole body that refuses to part with its offending members; salvation requires a violent severing of that which drags the soul downward.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ερρέθη δε δε ὁϲ ἁν απο την γυναικα ἁυτου δοτω αυτῆ αποϲταϲιον ·

**English Translation**
Now it was said: Whoever dismisses the woman of him, let him give to her a certificate of divorce.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The former saying regulated the dissolution of the union, requiring a "certificate" to formalize the dismissal. This legal provision acknowledged the separation, granting the woman a document of her release. It was a concession to order, preventing a chaotic casting off without legal standing.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε λεγω ὁτι πᾶϲ ὁ απολυων τ γυναικα ἁυτου πα λογου πορ ποιε'ι αυτην μοιχευθηναι · και ὁϲ αν εαν απολε γαμη μοιχατε μοιχαται :

**English Translation**
But I say that everyone dismissing the woman of him, beside the matter of fornication, makes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a dismissed [woman] commits adultery.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The new command restricts dismissal rigidly to the "matter of fornication." To dismiss a wife for any other cause is to force her into a state where her subsequent union is adulterous, thus the husband "makes her to commit adultery." Furthermore, the man who marries the "dismissed" woman enters into that same adultery, for the bond is indissoluble by human will, save for the specific corruption of the marriage bed.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
παλιν ηκουϲατε ο ερρέθη τοιϲ αρ ουκʼ εφιὁρ · αποδωϲιϲ δε τω τουϲ ορ ϲου :

**English Translation**
Again you heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but shall render to the [one] the oaths of you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "ancients" were commanded to honor their word, specifically prohibiting false swearing. The obligation was to "render" or pay back the oaths sworn, fulfilling the vow made. This bound the speaker to truthfulness through the mechanism of the oath, ensuring that what was promised to the witness was performed.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε λεγω μη ομοϲαι ολωϲ · μητε εν τω ο ο ὁτι θρονοϲ εϲτιν του

**English Translation**
But I say do not swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is a throne of the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prohibition is absolute: "do not swear at all." The invocation of "heaven" is forbidden because heaven is not empty space but a "throne." To swear by the throne is to encroach upon the dignity of the One who sits upon it, for we possess no authority over the divine seat to use it as a pledge for our veracity.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
μητε εν τη γη ὁτι εϲτιν των πο αυτου · μητε ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα ὁ πολιϲ εϲτιν του μεγαλου βαϲιλε ·

**English Translation**
Neither by the earth, because it is [the footstool] of the feet of him; nor toward Jerusalem, because it is a city of the great king.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The earth is merely that which is "of the feet of him," a footstool of the Divine presence. Jerusalem is not a secular location but the "city of the great king." Every part of creation, high or low, belongs to the King; to swear by these is to misappropriate the property of the Sovereign to guarantee the word of a subject.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
μητε μηδε μητε εν τη κε ϲου ομοϲηϲ ὁτι ου δυναϲαι μι τριχαν τριχα λευκ ποιηϲαι ἠ μελαι ·

**English Translation**
Neither... nor by the head of you shall you swear, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The redundancy of the negative emphasizes the restriction. Even one's own "head" is removed from the sphere of oaths because man lacks the power of creation; he cannot change the nature of even "one hair" to white or black. If we cannot control the smallest attribute of our own bodies, we have no standing to pledge them as collateral for our truth.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
εϲτω δε ο λογοϲ ‾̷‾ ναι ναι · ου ου · το δε περιϲϲον του εκ του πονη εϲτιν : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But let the word be yes yes; no no; but the excess of this is from the evil.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Simplicity of speech suffices for the faithful, requiring no oaths to bind the conscience. The duplication of affirmation or negation stands as a complete testimony of truth. Anything added beyond this plain declaration arises from the evil source, which seeks to entangle the soul in complexities and deceits.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
ηκουϲατε ὁτι ερρέ οφθαλμον αν οφθαλμου · και ὁδόντα αντι οδ

**English Translation**
You heard that it was said, Eye for eye; and tooth for tooth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ancient hearing established a law of strict equivalence to restrain boundless vengeance. Justice was measured by the physical loss, balancing the eye and the tooth. This statute curbed the impulse to exact greater penalties than the injury received.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε λεγω μη αντιϲτα τω ‾̷‾ πονη : αλλ οϲτιϲ ϲε ρα ειϲ επι την δε ϲιαγονα ϲτρε αυτω και τ αλλην

**English Translation**
But I say not to resist the evil; but whoever strikes you on the right jaw, turn to him also the other.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command forbids opposition to the evil, introducing a higher patience. Turning the cheek transforms the believer from a victim of violence into a master of peace. By offering the other jaw, one breaks the cycle of retaliation and exposes the aggressor to the shame of their own fury.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
και τω θε ϲοι κριθη και τον χιτω ϲου λαβιν αφεϲ τουτω αυτω και το ‾̷‾ ϊμα ϲου :

**English Translation**
And to the one wishing to be judged with you and to take your tunic, leave to this one also the garment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
When legal judgment seeks to strip away the undergarment, the spirit of detachment offers the outer cloak as well. Possession of material clothing is less vital than the preservation of a yielding spirit. The disciple conquers greed not by withholding, but by surrendering more than is demanded.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
και οϲτιϲ ϲε εαν ενγαρευϲη μιλιον εν μετ αυτου δυο

**English Translation**
And whoever shall impress you one mile, go with him two.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The forced burden of the first mile acts as a duty imposed by authority. The second mile changes the nature of the service from compulsion to voluntary charity. In doubling the distance, the believer converts an act of oppression into an exercise of freedom.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
τω αιτουντι ϲοι ϲε δοϲ και τον θελοντα απο ϲου δανιϲα μη αποϲτρα

**English Translation**
To the one asking you give, and the one wishing to borrow from you do not turn away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Benevolence must be responsive and immediate, closing neither the hand nor the heart. To turn away the borrower is to deny the stewardship of goods given by God. The act of giving takes precedence over the security of possession.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
ηκουϲατε οτι ερ αγαπηϲειϲ τον πληϲιον ϲου και μιϲηϲειϲ τον ‾̷‾ εχθρον ϲου ·

**English Translation**
You heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The former hearing defined the boundaries of affection by proximity and kinship. Hatred was permitted as the natural response to the adversary. This distinction served to isolate the community but is now exposed as an imperfect standard.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε λεγω α τουϲ ε υμων και προϲευχεϲθαι των διωκον

**English Translation**
But I say, Love the enemies of you and pray for those persecuting.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Love is now commanded to extend beyond the friendly to encompass the hostile. Prayer becomes the weapon against persecution, interceding for the very soul that inflicts harm. This directive aligns the human will with a divine charity that knows no barrier.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
οπωϲ γενηϲθε υϊοι του π ϋμων του ε ουρανοιϲ οτι τον ηλιον αυτου ανατελλι επι πο και αγα και βρεχι επι και βρεχι επι δικ(αι)ουϲ κ(αι) αδικουϲ ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
So that you may become sons of the Father of you, the one in heavens, because he makes his sun rise upon evil and good, and rains upon and rains upon righteous and unrighteous.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The status of sonship is verified by imitating the indiscriminate goodness of the Father. As the sun and the rain fall without judgment on both the just and the unjust, so must mercy flow. The repetition of the rain emphasizes the ceaseless and abundant nature of this divine provision.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
εαν γαρ αγαπηϲη τουϲ αγαπων τινα μιϲ εχετε ουχι και οι τελωναι το αυτο ποιουϲιν

**English Translation**
For if you love those loving [you], what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To love only where love is returned is a mere exchange, not a virtue. Even those associated with greed and extortion are capable of such reciprocal affection. True spiritual reward is reserved for those who transcend this common economy of the heart.

**Verse 47**
**Greek Text**
και εαν αϲπαϲη τουϲ αδελφουϲ μονον τι περιϲϲον ποι ουχι και οι εθνικοι το αυτο ποιουϲιν

**English Translation**
And if you greet the brothers only, what excess do you do? Do not even the gentiles do the same?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Limiting greetings to one's own kin restricts charity to the familiar. There is no excess of holiness in doing what comes naturally to the nations. The disciple is called to a broader recognition of humanity, surpassing the customs of the gentiles.

**Verse 48**
**Greek Text**
εϲεϲθε ουν ϋμιϲ τε ωϲ ο ϋμ ο ουρανιοϲ τελιοϲ ‾̷‾ εϲτιν :

**English Translation**
You shall be therefore perfect, as the [Father] of you, the heavenly, is perfect.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The call is to a completeness that mirrors the divine nature. As the Heavenly One lacks nothing in goodness, so the believer must strive for a wholeness of love that excludes no one. Perfection here is the fulfillment of mercy, knowing no limit.
