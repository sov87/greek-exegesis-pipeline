**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
ηκουϲεν ηρωδηϲ εν εκινω τω και εν εκινω τω καιρω ηκουϲεν ηρωδηϲ εν εκινω τω καιρω ηκουϲεν ηρωδηϲ ο τετρααρχηϲ την ακοην

**English Translation**
Heard Herod in that the and in that the time heard Herod in that the time heard Herod the tetrarch the report.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text strikes the ear with a threefold repetition of the hearing, pressing the urgency of the report upon the conscience of the ruler. Herod hears, and he hears again, and he hears yet a third time in the same season, for the report of truth cannot be silenced even in the courts of power. The Tetrarch is besieged by the rumor he cannot escape, and the very structure of the words surrounds him with the news he dreads.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
και ειπεν τοιϲ παιϲιν αυτου ουτοϲ εϲτ εϲτ ϊωαννηϲ ο βαπτι αυτοϲ ηγερ απο των νεκρ νεκρ · και δια τουτο αι δυ ενεργουϲ εν αυτω

**English Translation**
And he said to his servants, This is is John the Bapti[st]; he rose from the dead dead; and because of this the pow[ers] work in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear doubles the tongue of the tyrant, causing him to stammer "is is" and speak of the "dead dead." The guilty soul sees the one he slew returning with force, acknowledging that the grave has no hold over the righteous. Herod confesses that because of this resurrection, powers operate within the man, for he perceives that death has only multiplied the prophet's strength.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ο γαρ ηρω κρατηϲαϲ τον ϊωαννην εδηϲ αυτ και εν φυλακη εν τη φυλακη κ(αι) α δια ηρω την γυναι φιλιππου του αδελφου αυτου

**English Translation**
For Hero[d] having seized John bound him and in prison in the prison and p[ut away] because of Hero[dias] the wife of Philip his brother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The confinement is emphasized by the repetition "in prison in the prison," showing the depth of the dungeon where the prophet was cast to silence his voice. The cause of this double binding is explicitly named as the unlawful union involving Philip's wife. The text links the seizing of the holy man directly to the influence of the woman, binding the sin of the bedchamber to the chains of the dungeon.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
ελεγεν γαρ ϊωαν αυτω ουκ εξεϲτιν ϲοι εχιν αυτην

**English Translation**
For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The law of God is spoken with brevity and absolute clarity, cutting through the complexities of royal desire. John does not appeal to convenience or politics but stands solely upon what is lawful. The indictment is personal, directed "to him," placing the burden of the sin squarely upon the ruler who possesses what is not his.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) κ(αι) θελων αυτον α εφοβη τον οχλον ο ωϲ προφητην αυτον ειχον

**English Translation**
And and willing to [kill] him he feared the crowd w[ho] had him as a prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The doubled conjunction "and and" marks the hesitation of a man torn between two masteries: his bloodlust and his cowardice. He wills the destruction of the reprover, yet the fear of the multitude restrains his hand. The people hold John as a prophet, and this recognition by the common throng serves as a temporary shield against the ruler's intent.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
γενεϲιοιϲ δε γε του η ωρχηϲα η θυγατηρ τηϲ ηρωδιαδοϲ εν τω μεϲω και ηρε τω ηρωδη

**English Translation**
But at the birthday celebrations of the Hero[d] danced the daughter of Herodias in the midst and pleased Herod.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The occasion of the birthday becomes the theater for a deadly performance in the midst of the company. The daughter of Herodias pleases the king not by wisdom but by movement, ensnaring his senses. The pleasure of the ruler is the prelude to his entrapment, for the delight of the eye here blinds the judgment of the mind.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
οθεν μετα ορκου ωμολογηϲεν αυ δουναι ο εαν αιτηϲηται

**English Translation**
Whereupon with an oath he confessed to her to give whatever she might ask.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The oath is a confession of weakness, surrendering the authority of the throne to the whim of a request. By binding himself to an unknown demand, he makes his power subservient to the chance of the moment. He promises a gift without measure, unaware that the price will be the blood of the righteous.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
η δε προβιβαϲθιϲα ϋ τηϲ αυτηϲ ειπεν δοϲ μοι φηϲιν ωδε επι πινακι την κεφαλην ϊ του βα

**English Translation**
And she, being urged by her [mother], said, Give me, she says, here on a platter the head of J[ohn] the Ba[ptist].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The daughter speaks, but the will is that of the mother who urges her forward. The demand is specific and gruesome: the head is to be presented "here," bringing the reality of murder directly into the feast. She asks for the head of J[ohn] the Ba[ptist] as if it were a course to be served, turning the banquet into a place of execution.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
και ελυπη ο βαϲιλευϲ δια δε τουϲ ορκουϲ και τουϲ ϲυνανακιμε εκελευϲεν δοθηναι

**English Translation**
And grieved [was] the king, but because of the oaths and those reclining with [him] he commanded it to be given.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Grief touches the king, yet it is a fruitless sorrow that does not lead to repentance. He is enslaved by his own oaths and the gaze of those reclining at the table, fearing man more than God. He commands the unjust gift to be given, sacrificing justice to preserve his honor before guests.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και πεμ απεκεφαλιϲ τον ϊωαννην εν τη φυλακη

**English Translation**
And send[ing] he beheaded John in the prison.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The act is done with cold efficiency; the sending is immediate, and the deed is final. The prison, intended to silence the voice, becomes the place of martyrdom. John is separated from his body in the dark, but his testimony remains unbound.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
και ηνε η κεφαλη αυ επι πινακι και εδοθη τω κοραϲιω και ηνεγκεν τη αυτηϲ

**English Translation**
And brought [was] his head on a platter and given to the damsel and she brought [it] to her [mother].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gruesome trophy travels from the prison to the platter, from the platter to the damsel, and from the damsel to the mother. The chain of transmission completes the sin, as the evidence of the murder is delivered into the hands of the one who conceived it. The banquet hall receives the dead, implicating all who handle the burden.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και προϲ οι μα αυτου ηρ το πτωμα αυτου αυτου και εθαψαν αυτον αυτο και ελθοντεϲ α τω

**English Translation**
And coming the disci[ples] of him took the corpse of him of him and buried him him and coming reported to the.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples perform the final act of devotion, claiming the corpse which the text doubly emphasizes as "of him of him," stressing their specific claim to their master's body. They bury "him him," affirming the reality of his death. They then depart to report the event, though the text abruptly halts at "to the," leaving the recipient of the sorrowful news unspoken, yet understood by the faithful to be the One who hears all.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ο α εκι εν πλοιω ει ειϲ ερημον τοπον κατ ιδιαν και ακου οι οχλοι ηκολουθηϲαν αυτω πεζοι απο των πολεων

**English Translation**
And having heard, the [One] there [went] in a boat int- into a desert place apart; and hearing, the crowds followed him on foot from the cities.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the Lord withdraws from the noise of the world to the silence of the desert. The text marks a sharp division: the [One] departs by sea to solitude, yet the many, driven by spiritual hunger, pursue Him by land. Their tracking on foot signifies the effort required to seek the Divine when He seems to recede. We must leave the cities—places of commerce and distraction—to find the Savior in the desolate places where He awaits.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθων ειδεν πολυν οχλον και εϲπλαγχνιϲθη επ αυτοιϲ και ε τουϲ αρρωϲτουϲ αυτ αυτ

**English Translation**
And coming forth he saw a great crowd and was moved with compassion upon them and [healed] their sick, their [sick].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The movement of God is always one of descent and mercy. He sees the multitude not as a burden but as a gathering in need of pity. The visceral compassion—stirred in the very bowels—translates immediately into action; the text abbreviates the act of healing to a single letter, as if to show that for the Master, the restoration of the sick requires but a fragment of His power. He attends to the brokenness of their bodies to prepare them for the feeding of their souls.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
οψιαϲ δε γενομε προϲηλθον αυτω οι μαθητε λεγοντεϲ ερημοϲ εϲτιν ο τοποϲ και η ωρα παρηλθεν ηδη απολυϲον ουν τουϲ οχλουϲ ινα απελθοντεϲ ειϲ ταϲ χωραϲ κωμαϲ αγο εαυτοιϲ βρωματα

**English Translation**
And evening having come, the disciples came to him saying, The place is desert and the hour already passed; release therefore the crowds, that going away into the country [and] villages they might buy for themselves foods.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples judge by the senses: they see the setting sun and the barren earth, and they despair. Their solution is dispersion—"release the crowds"—urging the people to return to the world to buy what they can. They do not yet understand that the One standing before them is the source of all sustenance. It is a temptation common to the faithful: to send the hungry away to the markets of men rather than trusting in the providence of God present in the desert.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ ου χριαν εχουϲιν απελθιν δοτε αυ ϋμιϲ φαγιν

**English Translation**
But he said to them, They have no need to go away; give [to] them, you, [something] to eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is abrupt and impossible to human reckoning. "Give to them, you." By placing the burden of provision upon the empty-handed disciples, the Lord exposes their insufficiency. They must learn that they cannot generate the food, yet they are commanded to give it. This establishes the order of ministry: we are to distribute what we do not possess, relying entirely on what we receive from His hand.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
οι δε λεγουϲιν αυ ουκ εχομεν ωδε αρτουϲ ει μη πεν ει μη πεντε αρτουϲ και δυο ϊχθυαϲ

**English Translation**
But they say to [him], We have not here loaves, except fiv-, except five loaves and two fish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Confession precedes the miracle. The stutter in their speech—"except fiv-, except five"—betrays their hesitation and embarrassment at the paltriness of their offering. Five loaves and two fish are nothing against a multitude, yet they are everything the disciples have. The Lord requires us to bring our poverty to light, to admit exactly what we lack, so that His abundance may be glorified in our scarcity.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν φερε μοι ωδε αυτουϲ

**English Translation**
But he said, Bring them here to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the pivot of the event. The meager resources must be transferred from the hands of men to the hands of the Master. "Bring them here to me." As long as the loaves remain with the disciples, they are merely five; in the hands of the Lord, they become infinite. We must surrender our small gifts, detaching them from our own control, to see them multiplied.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
και εκελευϲεν τουϲ οχλουϲ ανακλιθη επι του χορτου και λαβων τουϲ · · αρτουϲ και τουϲ · · ϊχθυαϲ αναβλε ειϲ τον ο ο ευλογηϲεν και κλαϲαϲ εδωκεν τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ τουϲ αρτουϲ οι δε μαθηται τοιϲ ο

**English Translation**
And he commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass; and taking the .. loaves and the .. fish, looking up to the h-, heaven, he blessed; and breaking he gave to the disciples the loaves, and the disciples to the c[rowds].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Order is established before the feast; the people must recline in peace upon the grass. The Lord looks up to heaven, connecting the earthly gift with the celestial Father, blessing the creation. The hierarchy of grace is clearly defined: from God to the Master, from the Master to the disciples, and from the disciples to the crowds. The bread is broken to be shared; it multiplies only in the act of giving and distribution.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και εφαγον παντεϲ και εχορ και η το περιϲϲευ των κλαϲματων δωδεκα κοφι πληρειϲ

**English Translation**
And they all ate and were filled; and they took up the abundance of the fragments, twelve baskets full.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The result of divine blessing is satiety; "all ate and were filled." God gives not merely enough to survive, but enough to satisfy and to spare. The twelve baskets of fragments remaining signify that the grace of Christ is inexhaustible, exceeding the capacity of those who receive it. These baskets stand as a testimony to the twelve disciples, that in ministering the Lord's gifts, they too shall have an abundance remaining for themselves.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
οι δε εϲθιοντεϲ ηϲ ηϲ ανδρεϲ ωϲι ωϲει πεν χω γυναικων και παιδιων

**English Translation**
And those eating were, were men about, about five [thousand], apart from women and children.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The number is vast, counted by the men yet encompassing the families. The text stammers—"were, were"—as if overwhelmed by the magnitude of the flock fed by such little bread. That women and children are mentioned separately reminds us that the reach of God's providence extends beyond the counted heads of the household to the silent and the small, feeding the entire community of the faithful.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ευθεωϲ η τουϲ μαθηταϲ εμβη ειϲ το πλοιον και προαγιν αυ ειϲ το περαν εωϲ ου απολυϲη τουϲ οχλουϲ

**English Translation**
And immediately he [constrained] the disciples to enter into the boat and to go before [him] to the other side, until he should release the crowds.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
No sooner is the glory revealed than the discipline returns. He "immediately" compels them to depart, preventing them from lingering in the adulation of the crowd. They are sent into the boat—the symbol of the Church's journey—to cross to the other side. The Master remains behind to dismiss the multitude, showing His authority to gather and to scatter, while the disciples must learn obedience in the transition from the feast to the journey.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και κ(αι) απολυϲαϲ τουϲ οχλουϲ ανεβη ειϲ το οροϲ κατ ϊδιαν προ οψιαϲ δε γενομε μονοϲ ην ε

**English Translation**
And, and having released the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pr[ay]; and evening having come, he was alone th[ere].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cycle returns to solitude. Having served the many, the Lord ascends the mountain to commune with the Father. The repetition of "and" emphasizes the sequence of deliberate actions. He is alone in the evening, teaching us that public ministry must be bracketed by private prayer. The mountain serves as the altar of His intercession, elevated above the tumult of the world below.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
το δε πλοιον ηδη μεϲον τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ ην βα ϋ των κυματ κυματ ην γαρ εναντιοϲ ο ανεμοϲ

**English Translation**
But the boat was already in the middle of the sea, [tormented] by the waves, waves; for the wind was contrary.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the Lord prays in peace, the disciples struggle in the midst of the sea. The boat is battered by the repetition of "waves, waves," illustrating the relentless assault of trials. The wind is "contrary," opposing their progress. This is the condition of the faithful in the world: separated from the visible presence of Christ, in the center of the deep, striving against the opposing forces that seek to overwhelm the vessel of the Church.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
τεταρτη δε φυλα τηϲ νυκτοϲ ηλ προϲ αυτουϲ πε επι τ τ θαλαϲϲαν

**English Translation**
And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them walking on the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The night is divided into watches, marking the endurance of the darkness, yet the Lord arrives in the final hours to bring relief. He approaches not by the laws of nature but by treading upon the unstable waters, demonstrating that the chaotic sea is a pavement for his feet. He comes to them specifically, seeking his own even in the midst of the deep.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
ϊδοντεϲ δε οι δε μαθηται ϊδοντεϲ αυτον επι τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ περιπα εταραχθη λεγοντεϲ ο φανταϲμα εϲ και απο του φοβου εκραξαν

**English Translation**
But seeing, the disciples seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled saying that it is a phantasm; and from fear they cried out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text doubles the act of seeing, emphasizing the undeniable yet terrifying nature of the vision. The disciples, overwhelmed by the sight of a man walking where no man can stand, conclude he must be a phantasm, a specter of the mind. Their cry is the natural voice of human frailty confronting a power it cannot comprehend.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ευθυϲ δε ελαληϲεν ο αυτοιϲ λεγων θαρ εγω ειμι μη φοβιϲθε

**English Translation**
But immediately he spoke to them saying, Take courage, I am; do not fear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Before the wind is stilled, the voice is sent forth to still the heart. The command to take courage is grounded solely in the revelation "I am," which asserts his absolute presence and being. Fear is banished not by the removal of danger, but by the recognition of the one who speaks.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
αποκριθιϲ δε αυτω ο πετροϲ ειπεν ει ϲυ ει κελευ με ελθιν προϲ ϲε επι τα ϋδατα

**English Translation**
And answering him Peter said, If it is you, command me to come to you upon the waters.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter does not ask merely to be saved from the storm, but to participate in the dominion of the Master. He recognizes that safety lies in drawing near to him, even if it requires traversing the impossible. He waits for the command, knowing that only the word of the Lord can make the waters a path.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν ελθε και καταβαϲ απο του πλοιου πετροϲ πε επι τα ϋδατα ελθιν ηλ ουν προϲ τ τ ι

**English Translation**
And he said, Come. And Peter having descended from the ship walked upon the waters to come... he came therefore to Jesus.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The single word "Come" carries sufficient power to sustain the walker. Peter abandons the artificial security of the ship for the miraculous security of obedience. His movement is directed entirely toward Jesus, for it is the person, not the miracle, that draws him across the abyss.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
βλεπων δε τ τ ανεμον εφοβη και αρξαμενοϲ καταποντιζεϲθε εκραξεν λεγων ϲωϲον με

**English Translation**
But seeing the wind he feared; and beginning to sink he cried out saying, Save me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
When the eye is diverted from the Lord to the violence of the wind, the heavy nature of the flesh asserts itself, and he begins to sink. Fear enters when the focus shifts from the Commander to the creation. The cry "Save me" is the concise prayer of the drowning, acknowledging that salvation is external to himself.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
ευ δε ο εκτιναϲ την χειρα επελα αυτου και λε αυτω ολιγοπι ειϲ τι εδιϲταϲαϲ

**English Translation**
And immediately stretching out the hand he took hold of him and says to him, O little-faith, for what did you doubt?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rescue is immediate; the hand of the Lord is swifter than the pull of the depths. The rebuke addresses the "little-faith," identifying the cause of the sinking not as the storm's power but as the internal hesitation. Doubt is the weight that drags the soul downward when it should stand on the word of Christ.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
και αναβαντων αυτων ειϲ το πλοι εκοπαϲεν ο α

**English Translation**
And as they went up into the ship, the wind ceased.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The return to the collective vessel brings peace to the elements. The wind, having served its purpose to test the faith of the disciple, yields silence in the presence of the Master. The cessation of the struggle marks the restoration of order.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
οι δε εν τω πλοιω προϲεκυ αυτω λε αληθωϲ ει :

**English Translation**
But those in the ship worshiped him saying, Truly you are.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The response to the miracle is worship, the proper posture of the creature before the Creator. Their confession "Truly you are" stands as a truncated but absolute affirmation of his reality. They acknowledge his existence as the defined Truth, stopping their speech at the mystery of his being.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
και διαπε ηλθον επι την γην ειϲ γ γ

**English Translation**
And having crossed over they came onto the land into G...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crossing concludes with arrival upon the firm earth. The turbulent waters are left behind, and they enter the specific region designated for their ministry. The text marks the transition from the miracle of the sea to the work upon the land.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και επι αυτον οι ανδρεϲ του τοπου απεϲτιλαν ειϲ ολ ολ την περιχωρον εκινην και προϲη αυτω π π τουϲ κακωϲ ε

**English Translation**
And recognizing him the men of the place sent into all the surrounding region and brought to him all those having illness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Recognition of the Lord compels action; the men do not keep the presence of the healer to themselves but send word to the whole region. They become the gatherers of the sick, understanding that the presence of the Master is the opportunity for the restoration of all who suffer.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
και παρε αυτον ϊ μονον αψων του κραϲπεδου του ϊματιου αυτου και οϲοι ηψαντο εϲωθηϲαν

**English Translation**
And besought him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched were saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Faith is distilled to the simplest point of contact: the mere touch of the fringe. The power of the Lord saturates even his garment, so that the physical reach of the suffering finds a remedy. Salvation here is the healing of the body, granted freely to as many as make the effort to touch.
