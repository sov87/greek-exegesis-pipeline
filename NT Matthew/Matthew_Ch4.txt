**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
τοτε ο ανηχθη του ειϲ την ερημον πι πειραϲθηναι ϋπο του διαβολου

**English Translation**
Then the [Jesus] was led up [of] the [Spirit] into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine passive "was led up" (*anēchthē*); the Lord does not rush into conflict but follows the leading of the Spirit (*tou* implied). He goes into the "erēmon," the desolate place, stripping away all earthly support. The purpose is explicit: *peirasthēnai*, to be tested. It is necessary that the Second Adam face the adversary where the first Adam failed, though here in a desert rather than a garden.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και νη ημεραϲ τεϲϲερακοντα κ(αι) τεϲϲερακοντα νυκταϲ επιναϲεν ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And [having fasted] forty days and forty nights, he hungered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text confirms the reality of the Incarnation. After the sacred duration of forty days—echoing the Law and the Prophets—He did not merely appear to fast, but *epinasen* (he hungered). The flesh was weak, exposing Him to the tempter's assault. His divinity did not swallow up his humanity; rather, He endured the pangs of the body to sanctify our struggle against the flesh.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και προϲελθων ὁ πιραζων εῖπ αυτω ἑι ει του εὶπε ειπον οι λιθοι ὁυτοι αρτοι γενωνται : > ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And approaching, the tempter said to him, "If you are [Son] of [God], speak [that] these stones might become loaves."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "tempter" (*ho pirazōn*) strikes at the identity of the Lord: "If you are..." (*ei ei*). He challenges the Sonship to serve the belly. The command to turn stones to bread is a temptation to use divine power for personal relief, to abandon the suffering of the fast for an instant miracle of comfort.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ὁ δε δ αποκριθειϲ > εῖπεν · γεγραπται γεγραπτε > ουκʼ επ αρτω > μο ζηϲεται ὁ > αλʼλ επι παντι > ρη > εκπορευο δια > ϲτομα : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But he answering said, "It is written, it is written: 'Not on bread only shall the [man] live, but on every word proceeding through [the] mouth.'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord repels the assault not with thunder, but with the written Word (*gegraptai*). He defines true life not by material sustenance (*artō*) but by the *rhēma* (word) that flows (*ekporeuo*) from God. The repetition in the text emphasizes the finality of the Scripture. He vindicates the nature of man (*anthrōpos* implied), who requires spiritual food more than earthly bread.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
τοτε παραλαμβα αυτον ὁ διαβο ειϲ την ἁγι πολιν και εϲτη αυτον επι το πτερυγιον του ϊ

**English Translation**
Then the devil takes him into the holy city and stood him upon the pinnacle of the [temple].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scene shifts to the "Holy City" (*hagi polin*). The adversary places the Lord upon the "pinnacle" (*pterygion*), the highest point of religious visibility. This is a temptation of spiritual pride and presumption, set within the very precincts of God's house (*tou hierou* implied), turning the holy place into a theater of vanity.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
και λεγει ειπεν λεγει αυ ει ὑϊοϲ ει του βαλε ϲεαυτον κατω : γεγραπται γαρ ὁτι τοιϲ αγʼγε ἁυτου εντε εντελεῖτε εντελεῖτε περὶ ϲου και επι χειρων αροῦ αρουϲι ϲε μήποτε προϲκόψηϲ προϲ λιθον τον ποδα ϲου ·

**English Translation**
And says [said] says to him, "If you are Son of [God], cast yourself down; for it is written that to his angels he shall give command concerning you, and on hands they shall bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The deceiver now arms himself with Scripture (*gegraptai gar*), quoting the Psalm to justify a test of God. He urges a miraculous display—"cast yourself down"—to force the Father's hand. The promise of angelic protection is twisted into a license for recklessness. The enemy seeks to separate the Son from the Father's will by suggesting that the Father must prove His love through intervention.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο ‾̷‾ παλιν · γεγραπται · > ουκʼ εκπιραϲειϲ > τον ϲου · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
[Jesus] said to him again, "It is written: 'You shall not tempt the [Lord] your [God].'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord silences the twisted scripture with a corrective scripture. "You shall not tempt" (*ouk ekpiraseis*) establishes that trust does not demand proof. To put the Lord (*ton kyrion*) to the test is an act of doubt, not faith. The Son remains in humble alignment with the Father, refusing to orchestrate a spectacle.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
παλιν παραλαμ αυτον ὁ δι ειϲ ὅροϲ λῖαν και δικνυει αυτω πα ταϲ βαϲιλιαϲ του κοϲμου · και την δοξαν αυτ

**English Translation**
Again the devil takes him to a mountain exceedingly [high] and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The third trial is the lust for power. From a "mountain exceedingly" (*oros lian*), the devil displays a panoramic illusion of "all the kingdoms" (*pasas tas basilias*). He reveals their "glory" (*doxan*), tempting the King of Kings with a shortcut to earthly rule, bypassing the Cross. It is a vision of the world's grandeur without the world's redemption.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτω · ταυτα ϲοι παντα δωϲω ˙ εαν πεϲ προϲκυνηϲηϲ μοι · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And said to him, "These things to you all I will give, if falling down you worship me."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the naked ambition of the evil one: he desires worship (*proskynēsēs*). He claims possession of the world and offers it as a bribe. The condition is apostasy: "falling down" (*pesōn*) before a creature. It is the ultimate exchange: the whole world for the soul. The devil seeks to usurp the place of God in the heart of the Messiah.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγι αυτω ο ϋπαγε ϲατανα · > γεγραπται γαρ > τον ϲου > προϲ · και > αυ μονω > λατρευ : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Then [Jesus] says to him, "Go, Satan! For it is written: 'The [Lord] your [God] you shall worship, and him only you shall serve.'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord exercises His authority: "Go, Satan." He banishes the tempter with the fundamental truth of the Law. Worship (*proskynēseis*) and service (*latreuseis*) belong to God alone (*monō*). There can be no dual allegiance. By this word, the Lord re-establishes the rightful order of creation, submitting fully to the Father and rejecting the usurper.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
τοτε αφιηϲιν αυ ὁ διαβολοϲ ‾̷‾ και ϊδου αγʼγελοι προϲῆλθον και διηκονουν αυτω :

**English Translation**
Then the devil leaves him; and behold, angels approached and were ministering to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Only when the battle is won does the enemy depart (*aphiēsin*). The "angels" (*aggeloi*), who were not summoned for a vain display in the holy city, now approach to serve (*diēkonoun*) in the wilderness. They minister to the Victor who stood firm in his humanity. The divine succor follows obedience; it does not replace the struggle.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ‾̷‾ οτι ὁτι ὁτι παρεδο ανεχωρηϲ ειϲ την γαλιλαι : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Now having heard that... that... that [John] was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters (*oti oti oti*) as it recounts the transition. The forerunner has been "delivered up" (*paredothē*), marking the end of the preparatory age. The Lord "withdrew" (*anechōrēsen*) into Galilee. This is not a retreat of fear, but a strategic movement. As the voice in the wilderness is silenced, the Word begins His proclamation in the regions of the Gentiles.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και καταλιπων την ναζαρεθʼ ναζαρα ελ κατώκηϲ ειϲ καφαρναουμ την παρα θαλαϲϲ παραθαλαϲϲι · εν ὁριοιϲ ζαβου · και νεφθα ·

**English Translation**
And leaving Nazareth (Nazara), having come he settled in Capernaum the seaside, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthali.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the deliberate movement of the Word: He leaves the hidden life of Nazareth to dwell in Capernaum. He does not merely visit but settles (*katōkēsen*), making the "seaside" the seat of His ministry. By positioning Himself in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthali, He physically occupies the geography of the ancient promise, ensuring that the salvation of God is anchored in the specific territories alloted to the tribes, turning a borderland into the center of the world.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα ‾̷‾ πληρω το ρηθεν δια ηϲαϊου του προ λεγοντοϲ · >

**English Translation**
In order that might be fulfilled that which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist uses the conjunction *ina* (in order that) to demonstrate that these movements are not accidental wanderings but divine necessities. The history of the Christ is the architecture of prophecy realized. It is spoken *through* (*dia*) Isaiah, for the prophet is but the vessel; the Speaker who ordains the fulfillment is the Spirit of God.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
γη ζαβουλων · > και γη νεφθαλειμ · > ὁδον θαλαϲϲηϲ > περαν του > ϊορδα γαλιλαῖα των > εθνῶν

**English Translation**
Land of Zabulon and land of Nephthali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the text identifies the "Galilee of the Gentiles." This designation is crucial; the light of Christ is not restricted to the purity of Judea but breaks forth in the mixed and marginalized regions "beyond the Jordan." The "way of the sea" becomes the path of the Gospel, signifying that the message is prepared to traverse the waters to the nations.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ὁ λαοϲ ὁ > καθημενοϲ εν > ϲκοτι ϲκοτια φωϲ ιδεν εῖδεν > μεγα · και τοιϲ > κα εν > χω και ϲκιᾶ > θανα φωϲ > ανετι αυτοιϲ : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
The people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, light rose for them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the posture of the people: they are "sitting" (*kathēmenos*) in darkness, suggesting a state of paralysis and inability to rise by their own power. They inhabit not merely a place of danger but the very "shadow of death." The salvation comes as an external dawn; the light "rose" (*aneteilen*) upon them like the sun, an act of unmerited grace illuminating those fixed in the gloom of mortality.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
απο τοτε ηρξατο ο κηρυϲϲιν κηρυϲϲειν · και λεγιν μετανοεῖ ηγʼγικεν γαρ ἡ βαϲιλια βαϲιλεῖα των ου : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
From then began [he] to preach and to say: Repent! For the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ministry commences with a command of singular urgency: "Repent" (*metanoei*). This is not a suggestion but a requirement for the new reality. The reason given is the proximity of the Kingdom; it "has drawn near" (*ēngiken*). The Kingdom is no longer a distant hope but an imminent presence, pressing against the present moment, demanding a transformation of the mind (*metanoia*).

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
περιπατων δε πα την θαλαϲϲαν τηϲ γαλιλαῖαϲ εῖ δυο αδελφουϲ · ϲιμωνα τον λεγο καλουμενον πετρον · και ανδρεαν τον αδελʼφον αυτου βαλʼλονταϲ αμ ειϲ την θαλαϲϲαν η γαρ ἁλεειϲ ἁλιειϲ ἁλιειϲ ·

**English Translation**
And walking by the sea of Galilee he saw two brothers, Simon the one called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting [a net] into the sea; for they were fishers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord seeks His ministers in the midst of their labor. He finds brothers by blood—Simon and Andrew—to make them brothers in the spirit. The text anticipates Simon's role by identifying him as "the one called Peter" (Rock), even while he is yet casting nets. Their trade as fishers is noted not for trivia, but because the nature of their work—gathering from the deep—is about to be transfigured.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και ‾̷‾ λεγει αυτοιϲ · δευ ὀπιϲω μου · και ποιηϲω ϋμαϲ γενεϲθαι αλιειϲ α̣λε̣ειϲ

**English Translation**
And he says to them: Come behind me, and I will make you to become fishers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command "Come behind me" establishes the definition of a disciple: one who follows, placing the Master ahead. The promise is one of ontological change—"I will make you to become" (*poiēsō hymas genesthai*). He does not simply give them a new task; He remakes their being. They remain fishers, but the object of their catch is now implied to be of a higher order, though the text here simply calls them "fishers," leaving the scope infinite.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ὁι δε ευθεωϲ αφεντεϲ τα δικτυα ηκολου αυτω · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And they immediately, having left the nets, followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no hesitation in the response of faith. The adverb "immediately" (*eutheōs*) condemns our delays. They left the tools of their livelihood ("the nets") to grasp the poverty of the way. To follow the Word requires the abandonment of the world's entanglements.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και προβαϲ εκει ˙ ϊδεν αλʼλουϲ δυο αδελφουϲ · ϊα τον του ζεβεδαιου · και ϊω τον αδελ ἁυτου εαυτου ἁυτου · εν τω πλοιω μετα ζε του ἁυτων καταρτί τα δικτυ ἁυτων και εκα αυτουϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having gone forward from there, he saw others, two brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their [father], mending their nets, and he called them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The calling continues, claiming another pair of brothers. Here the bond is tighter: they are with their father, Zebedee, and are "mending" (*katartizontas*)—preparing their nets. The Lord interrupts not only their work but their family duty. The call of God supersedes the obligations of blood and the preparation for earthly labor.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ευθεωϲ αφ το πλοιον αυ και τον πατε ἁυτων ηκολου αυτω : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And they immediately, having left the boat and their father, followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacrifice is total. They leave "the boat"—their property and security—and "their father"—their lineage and past. This immediate severance demonstrates that the new family of the Kingdom takes precedence over the old patriarchies of the earth. They follow Him, trading a father on earth for the Father in heaven.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και περιῆγεν ο εν τη γαλιλαια ολην την γαλιλαιαν δι αυτουϲ εν ταιϲ ϲυναγω ἀυτων και κη το ευαγʼγε τηϲ βαϲιλι · και θεραπευ παϲαν νοϲον και παϲαν μαλα εν τω λαω ·

**English Translation**
And he went about in Galilee, the whole Galilee, teaching them in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every weakness in the people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ministry is threefold: teaching the mind, preaching the Kingdom to the heart, and healing the body. He enters "their" synagogues, invading the established religious order with the new "Gospel of the Kingdom." His power is absolute, curing "every" (*pasan*) disease and weakness, proving that the Kingdom brings restoration to the entirety of the human condition.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και εξηλθεν η ‾̷‾ α αυτου ειϲ πα την ϲυριαν και προϲηνεγʼκ αυτω πανταϲ τουϲ κακωϲ εχονταϲ ποικιλαιϲ νοϲοιϲ και βαϲανουϲ βαϲανοι̣ϲ ϲυ και δε̣μονιαζο ϲ̣ελ̣η̣νιαζομενουϲ δα̣ι̣μονιαζομενουϲ και ϲε · και παραλυτικουϲ · και εθεραπευϲεν αυτουϲ ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And the [report] of him went out into all Syria; and they brought to him all those having ailments, with various diseases and torments held, and demon-possessed [and] moon-struck [and] demon-possessed, and paralytics; and he healed them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The fame of the Christ breaches the borders of Israel, reaching the Gentile lands of Syria. The catalog of misery presented to Him—torments (*basanois*), those possessed by demons (repeated in the text, emphasizing the severity of the spiritual assault), and the moon-struck (*selēniazomenous*)—represents the fullness of the Fall. He receives this mass of suffering humanity and, with divine authority, "healed them," demonstrating that He is the Lord of both the visible body and the invisible spirit.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και ηκολουθηϲ αυτω οχλοι πολʼ απο τηϲ γαλι και δεκαπο και ϊεροϲο · και ϊου · και περαν του ϊορδανου : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And followed him crowds many from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the magnetic pull of the Divine Physician. The text records that *many crowds* did not merely observe Him, but *followed* (`ηκολουθηϲ`), indicating a movement of both body and soul away from their native regions toward the person of the Christ (`αυτω`). The geography here is theological: the gathering includes the faithful from the religious center (`Jerusalem` and `Judea`), the rural north (`Galilee`), the region of ten cities (`Decapolis`), and the eastern lands (`beyond the Jordan`). Thus, the spiritual net is cast wide, drawing together the dispersed fragments of the land into a singular unity around the Lord, demonstrating that His authority transcends local boundaries and compels the multitudes to abandon their homes to pursue the Light.
