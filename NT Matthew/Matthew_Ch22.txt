**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθειϲ ο παλιν ειπεν εν εν πα αυτοιϲ λε ˙

**English Translation**
And answering, he again spoke in parables to them, saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord continues his instruction not merely by plain speech but through the veil of parables, compelling the listener to search for the spiritual meaning hidden within the narrative. By answering, he shows that his teaching is responsive to the condition of those present, yet the repetition of the mode of speaking signifies that the mystery requires constant reiteration to penetrate the hardened heart.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
ωμοιωθη η βαϲι των ουραν α α βαϲιλι οϲτιϲ εποιηϲεν γαμουϲ τω ϋϊω αυτου

**English Translation**
The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made marriage feasts for his son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The kingdom is not static but is an active event initiated by the King, who is the Father. The solemnity of the occasion is the union of the Son with his bride, the assembly of the faithful. The feast is prepared by the authority of the King, indicating that the joy of the heavens is a divine gift provided for the honor of the Son, not a right claimed by the subjects.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
και απεϲτιλεν τουϲ δουλουϲ αυτου κα τουϲ κεκλη ειϲ τουϲ γαμουϲ και ουκ η ελθιν

**English Translation**
And he sent his slaves to call the called to the marriage feasts, and they would not come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The invitation is sent through servants, representing the prophetic messengers who declare the King's will. The tragedy lies in the will of those invited; they were already "the called" by covenant and name, yet when the moment of fulfillment arrived, their refusal was absolute. The dignity of the invitation is met with the indignity of rejection.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
παλιν απεϲτιλ αλλουϲ δουλουϲ λεγων ειπατε τοιϲ κεκλημενοιϲ ϊ το αριϲτον μου ητοιμακα οι ταυροι μου και τα ϲιτιϲτα τεθυμενα και παντα ετοιμα δευτε ειϲ τουϲ γα

**English Translation**
Again he sent other slaves saying: Say to the called, Behold my dinner I have prepared, my bulls and fatlings killed, and all things ready; come to the marriage feasts.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The patience of the King is demonstrated by a second mission, utilizing different servants to renew the offer. The message details the richness of the provision—life has been sacrificed (bulls and fatlings) to prepare the table. The urgency "come" is grounded in the completeness of the preparation; nothing is lacking on the part of the King, leaving the invited without excuse.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
οι δε αμελη απηλθον ο μεν ειϲ τον ϊδι αγρον · οϲ δε ε την εμπορι εμπορι αυτου

**English Translation**
But they, neglecting, went away, the one to his own field, the other to his merchandise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Indifference serves as a shield against the divine summons. The guests prioritize their own possessions and commerce over the honor of the Son. The "own field" and "merchandise" signify the earthly attachments and profits that tether the soul to the ground, rendering it deaf to the call of the heavens. Neglect here is as damning as open rebellion.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
οι δε λοιποι κρατηϲαντεϲ τουϲ δουλουϲ αυτου ϋ και απεκτι

**English Translation**
And the rest, seizing his slaves, insulted and killed [them].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Those who did not merely drift away in apathy turned to active hostility. By seizing and killing the messengers, they struck at the King himself. This violence reveals the deep enmity residing in the hearts of those who should have been guests, transforming the invitation of grace into an occasion for bloodshed.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ο δε βαϲιλευϲ ωργι και πεμψαϲ τα ϲτρατευματα αυ απωλεϲεν τουϲ φονιϲ εκινουϲ κ(αι) την πολιν αυτ ενεπρηϲεν

**English Translation**
But the king was angry, and sending his armies, destroyed those murderers and burned their city.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Justice responds to the spurning of grace. The King acts with sovereign power, using armies to execute judgment upon the murderers. The destruction of the city signifies that the place which harbors the enemies of the Son cannot stand; the burning is the necessary purification of a rebellion that rejected the marriage feast.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
τοτε λεγι τοιϲ δου αυτου ο μεν γα ετοιμοϲ εϲτ οι δε κεκλημενοι ου ηϲαν αξιοι

**English Translation**
Then he says to his slaves: The marriage feast indeed is ready, but the called were not worthy.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The readiness of the feast remains unchanged despite the unworthiness of the guests. The King declares their unworthiness as a fact demonstrated by their actions. The vacancy at the table must be filled, for the King’s preparation will not be in vain; the failure of the first invited opens the door for a new calling.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
πορευ ουν επι ταϲ δι των ο> υ̣δ̣α̣των οδων και οϲουϲ ε ε ευρητε καλεϲατε ειϲ τουϲ γαμουϲ

**English Translation**
Go therefore onto the thoroughfares of the ways, and as many as you find, call to the marriage feasts.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command shifts from a specific group to a universal scope. The servants are sent to the very outlets of the roads, the public crossings where all humanity traverses. The limitation of status is removed; the qualification for the invitation is simply to be found by the servants. The wideness of the command ensures the King's house will be full.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
και εξελθοντεϲ οι δουλοι εκινοι ειϲ ταϲ οδουϲ ϲυνηγαγ ϲυνηγαγ πανταϲ ουϲ ευρον πονηρουϲ τε και αγαθουϲ και επλη ο νυμφων α

**English Translation**
And those slaves, going out into the ways, gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; and the bridechamber was filled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The obedience of the servants results in a mixed gathering. The "bad and good" are brought in together, indicating that the initial entry into the feast is based on the King's call, not the guests' prior moral standing. The fullness of the bridechamber is the goal, achieved by an indiscriminate gathering from the streets, forming a new assembly for the Son.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ειϲελθων δε ο βα θεαϲαϲθε τουϲ ανακιμενουϲ ειδεν εκει ανον ουκ ενδυ γαμου

**English Translation**
But the king, entering to view the reclining ones, saw there a man not clothed in a marriage garment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Though the call is universal, the presence in the feast requires appropriate attire. The King’s inspection reveals that being physically present is insufficient if one is not spiritually clothed. The marriage garment signifies the transformation required of the guest—honor, purity, and conformity to the dignity of the Son’s union.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και λεγι αυτω εταιρε πωϲ ει ειϲ ωδε μη ε ενδυμα γαμ(ου) ο δε εφιμωθη

**English Translation**
And he says to him: Comrade, how did you enter here not having a marriage garment? But he was silenced.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation exposes the intruder's lack of respect for the feast. The term "Comrade" acknowledges his presence but the question strips away his pretense. His silence is the admission of guilt; there is no defense for accepting the invitation while refusing the honor due to the host. He is speechless before the truth of his own negligence.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
τοτε ο βαϲιλευϲ ειπεν τοιϲ διακονοιϲ δη αυτου ποδαϲ και χιραϲ εκβαλε αυτον ειϲ το ϲκο το εξωτερον εκι εϲτε ο κλαυθ και ο βρυγμοϲ των οδοντων ︴

**English Translation**
Then the king said to the ministers, bind his feet and hands, cast him out into the darkness the outer; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The King commands the binding of hands and feet, signifying that he who refused to work righteousness or walk in the way of truth loses all capacity for action in the judgment. To be cast into the outer darkness is to be utterly severed from the light of the divine presence, which is the only true life of the soul. The weeping and gnashing of teeth reveal that this separation is not a cessation of being, but a state of profound regret and conscious torment.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
πολλοι γαρ ειϲιν κλη ολιγοι δε εκλεκτοι

**English Translation**
For many are called, but few chosen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine invitation is broad, extending to the multitude without restriction, yet the number of the elect is narrow. Being called is a grace offered to all, but being chosen requires a transformation that few permit to take hold within them. The distinction lies not in the caller, but in the disposition of those who receive the summons.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
τοτε πορευθεντεϲ οι φαριϲεοι ϲυμβου ελαβον οπωϲ αυτον παγιδευϲωϲιν εν λογω

**English Translation**
Then going the Pharisees took counsel how they might entrap him in word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Pharisees depart from the presence of Truth to conspire in secret, seeking to use the gift of speech as a weapon against the Giver. Their counsel is focused on entrapment, revealing that their inquiry is not a search for wisdom but a calculated hunt for accusation. They vainly imagine that the Eternal Word can be caught in the snares of human language.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και αποϲτελλουϲ αποϲτελλουϲ αυτω τουϲ μαθηταϲ αυτων μετα των ηρωδιανων λεγ λεγ διδαϲκαλε οι οτι αληθη ι αληθηϲ ει και την οδον του εν αληθια διδα και ου μελι ϲοι περι ουδενοϲ ου γαρ βλεπιϲ ειϲ προ

**English Translation**
And they send to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that true... true thou art, and the way of the [God] in truth thou teachest, and it cares thee for no one, for thou lookest not into face.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They approach with the address of a disciple but the heart of an adversary, acknowledging his truth only to test it. By confessing that he teaches the way in truth and looks not into the face of men, they testify against their own partiality and fear of man. They attempt to use his divine impartiality—which shows no favor to person or rank—as the lever for his destruction.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ειπε ουν ημιν τι ϲοι δοκι εξεϲτιν δουναι κ καιϲαρι η ου

**English Translation**
Tell therefore to us, what to thee seemeth? Is it lawful to give census to Caesar or not?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They frame a dilemma of earthly law, seeking to force a choice between political submission and religious fidelity. To give the census is presented as a potential betrayal of the faithful, while to withhold it is treason against the state. They seek a judgment on tribute, hoping to obscure the greater debt owed to heaven.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
γνουϲ δε ο την πο αυτων ει τι με πιραζετε ϋποκριται

**English Translation**
But knowing the wickedness of them he said, Why me tempt ye, hypocrites?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He penetrates the veneer of their respectful questioning to perceive the wickedness festering beneath. By naming them hypocrites, he exposes the chasm between their outward flattery and their inward malice. The temptation is revealed not as an intellectual inquiry, but as a trial of the heart, which he judges instantly.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
επιδιξα μοι το νομιϲμα του κηνϲου οι δε προϲηνεγκαν αυ δηναριον

**English Translation**
Show to me the coin of the census; and they brought to him a denarius.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He commands the production of the coin, forcing them to physically demonstrate their participation in the world's economy. The denarius they carry is a witness against them, proving they already operate under the authority they pretend to question. The material object serves to ground the spiritual lesson in undeniable fact.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
και λεγι αυτοιϲ τινοϲ η ϊκων αυτη και η επιγραφη

**English Translation**
And he saith to them, Whose is this image and the inscription?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The question draws the eye to the image stamped upon the metal, establishing the principle of ownership through likeness. As the coin bears the mark of the emperor, it belongs to his domain. This inquiry prepares the mind to consider what image is stamped upon the human soul, and to whom that soul therefore belongs.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
λεγου κεϲαροϲ τοτε λεγι αυτοιϲ α ουν τα κε καιϲαρι και τα του τω

**English Translation**
They say, Of Caesar. Then he saith to them, Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of the [God] to the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He delineates the boundaries of duty, assigning the temporal tribute to the temporal ruler, but reserving the total offering of the self for the Divine. By commanding to render to Caesar what is his, order is maintained; by commanding to render to the [God] what is the [God]'s, the soul—which bears the divine image—is claimed for its Creator. The coin is a debt to the king, but the person is a debt to the Maker.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
και ακουϲαντεϲ ε και αφ αφ αυτον απηλθ

**English Translation**
And hearing they marveled, and leaving him they departed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The marveling of the adversaries is an intellectual defeat that does not lead to spiritual submission. They are silenced by the wisdom that transcends their trap, yet they choose to leave him rather than follow him. Their departure signifies the tragic separation of those who see the light but retreat into their own shadows.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
και εν εκινη τη η προϲηλθον αυτω ϲαδδουκαιοι οι λεγον μη ειναι αναϲτα και επηρωτη αυτον

**English Translation**
And in that day came to him Sadducees, those saying not to be a resurrection, and asked him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A new assault arises from those who deny the hope of the future life, limiting existence to the visible world. The Sadducees' rejection of the resurrection strikes at the root of the promise, reducing the covenant to a matter of flesh and time. They approach not to learn of eternity, but to mock it.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
λεγον διδαϲκαλε μω ειπεν · εαν τιϲ αποθανη μη εχων τεκνα επιγαμβρευϲι ο α αυτου τ γυνεκα γυναικα αυτου και αναϲτηϲι ϲπερμα τω αδελφω αυτου

**English Translation**
Saying, Teacher, Moses said: If any die not having children, the brother of him shall marry as brother-in-law the wife of him and shall raise up seed to the brother of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They cite the law of Moses regarding earthly succession to construct an absurdity against the heavenly life. Their concern with "raising up seed" betrays a mindset that sees immortality only in progeny, oblivious to the power of God to sustain the living soul. They wield the letter of the law to obscure the intent of the Lawgiver.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε παρ ημιν ε αδελφοι και ο πρωτοϲ γημαϲ ε και μη εχων ϲπερμα αφη την γυνεκα γυναικα αυ τω αδελφω αυ

**English Translation**
Now there were with us [seven] brothers; and the first, having married, [died], and having no seed left his wife to his brother;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see here the futile cycle of mortality, where the number of brothers serves only to multiply the evidence of death. The text marks the first brother’s end with a mere letter, signifying how abruptly life is cut off without the fruit of seed. He leaves behind not a legacy of life, but a woman who becomes a heritage of widowhood passed from hand to hand.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
ομοιωϲ και ο δευτεροϲ και ο τρι εωϲ των επτα

**English Translation**
Likewise also the second and the third, until the seven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The succession of death proceeds with terrifying swiftness, consuming the second and the third just as the first. The phrase "until the seven" reveals the total exhaustion of the earthly lineage; the law of succession cannot conquer the grave, but only marches repeatedly into it.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
ϋϲτερον δε παντ απεθανεν η γυνη

**English Translation**
And afterwards of all died the woman.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Death is the final victor in this earthly narrative, claiming the woman last of all. She who was the shared object of the seven brothers becomes the shared partner in their mortality, proving that earthly marriage bonds dissolve into the common dust of "all."

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
εν τη αναϲταϲι ο τινοϲ των επτα ε γυνη παντεϲ γαρ εϲχον αυτην

**English Translation**
In the resurrection, therefore, of which of the seven [will she be] wife? For all had her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The questioners, trapped in carnal thinking, attempt to drag the conditions of mortality into the realm of immortality. They ask "of which," assuming possession persists where death has been abolished, unable to see that the resurrection is not a continuation of fleshly claims but a transformation of nature.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
και αποκριθιϲ ο ειπεν αυτοιϲ πλα μη ϊδοτεϲ ταϲ γραφαϲ μηδε την δυναμιν του

**English Translation**
And answering, the [Lord] said to them: Ye err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusation is twofold: ignorance of the written word and ignorance of the active Power. The text curtails the word for "err" to a sharp rebuke, suggesting their wandering is cut short by Truth. They fail to understand that the Power of the One is not limited by the laws of fading flesh.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
εν γαρ τη αναϲταϲι ουτε γαμουϲι ου γαμιζονται αλ ωϲ αγγελοι εν τω ουνω ο ειϲιν ειϲ ειϲιν

**English Translation**
For in the resurrection neither do they marry nor are they given in marriage, but are as angels in the heaven [where] they are.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The resurrection state is defined not by the union of bodies but by the likeness to angels. The redundancy in the text—"are... are"—emphasizes the stability of their being in that heavenly state; they no longer become or pass away, but simply *are*, fixed in the heavenly sphere where marriage is superseded by eternal existence.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
περι δε τηϲ αναϲτα αναϲταϲεωϲ των νεκρ ουκ ανεγνωτε το ρηθεν ϋμιν ϋπο του λεγοντοϲ

**English Translation**
But concerning the resurrec... resurrection of the dead, did you not read that spoken to you by the [One] saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers on "resurrection," repeating the word as if to force the mind to dwell upon this central mystery. The voice that speaks is immediate—"spoken to you"—indicating that the ancient words of the bush are a present address to every generation that doubts the living God.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
εγω ειμι ο αβρααμ και ϊϲακ ϊϲαακ και ϊακωβ ουκ εϲτιν νεκρων αλλα ζωντων

**English Translation**
"I am the [God of] Abraham, and Isaac Isaac, and Jacob." He is not of [the] dead, but of [the] living.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine declaration unites the I AM with the names of the patriarchs so closely that the text presents the article and the name as one reality. God is not the God of dust and memory, but of present vitality; for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob to be His, they must live in Him, for He cannot be the possession of that which does not exist.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
και ακουϲαντεϲ οι οχλοι εξεπληϲϲ επι τη διδαχη αυτου

**English Translation**
And hearing [this], the crowds were astonished at his teaching.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reaction of the multitude is one of being struck out of their senses. The teaching does not merely inform; it astounds, displacing their earthly expectations with a revelation of life that their minds cannot easily contain.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
οι δε φαριϲε φαριϲαιοι ακουϲαντεϲ οτι εφιμωϲε τουϲ ϲαδ ϲυνη επι το αυτο

**English Translation**
But the Phari... Pharisees, hearing that he silenced the Sad... [Sadducees], gathered together.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The adversaries are silenced, their mouths "muzzled" by the authority of the Word. Yet, rather than yielding, the remaining faction gathers, hardening their hearts in unity against the Truth. The text reflects their agitation in the fragmented naming of the sects, showing the disruption caused by the divine answer.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
και επηρωτηϲεν ειϲ εξ αυτων νομι πιραζων αυτ

**English Translation**
And one of them, a law... [lawyer], asked, tempting him:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here approaches one skilled in the statutes, yet his intent is malicious trial. The abbreviation of his title suggests that for all his knowledge of the "law," he is diminished in spirit, acting not as a seeker of wisdom but as a tempter of the Source of Wisdom.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
διδαϲκαλε ποια μεγαλη εν τω νομω

**English Translation**
"Teacher, which great [commandment is] in the law?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The questioner seeks to measure the "great" thing within the law, yet the text omits the word for "commandment," leaving the question to hover on the nature of Greatness itself. He asks for a part, but he stands before the Whole who embodies the fulfillment of all the law.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
ο δε εφη αυτω · αγαπηϲιϲ τον ϲου εν ολη τη καρ ϲου και εν ολη τη ψυχη ϲου και ε ολη τη διανοια ϲου

**English Translation**
And he said to him: You shall love the [Lord] of you with all the heart of you and with all the soul of you and in all the mind of you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command requires a totality of devotion that leaves no faculty in reserve. By demanding the heart, the soul, and the mind, the instruction binds the emotions, the life-force, and the intellect into a single movement toward the Divine. It is not sufficient to offer service with the body while the mind wanders, nor to engage the intellect while the heart remains cold; the entire person must be unified in this affection.

**Verse 38**
**Greek Text**
αυτη εϲτιν η μεγα και πρωτη εντο

**English Translation**
This is the great and first commandment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
It is designated great not merely by size but by authority, and first not solely in order but in origin. This commandment stands as the head from which all other righteous duties flow, for without the primary orientation of love toward the Creator, no subsequent action possesses true virtue. It is the foundation upon which the structure of piety is raised.

**Verse 39**
**Greek Text**
δευτερα δε δε ομοια αυ αγαπηϲιϲ τον πληϲιον ϲου ωϲ ϲεαυτον

**English Translation**
And the second is like it: You shall love the neighbor of you as yourself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The likeness of the second to the first indicates that the love of the neighbor is of the same substance as the love of God. One cannot sever the image from the Archetype; to despise the neighbor who is made in the image is to despise the One who stamped the image. The standard of this love is set within one's own nature, compelling the believer to extend to others the same care and preservation they instinctively seek for themselves.

**Verse 40**
**Greek Text**
εν ταυτεϲ τεϲ ταυταιϲ ταιϲ ταυταιϲ ταιϲ δυϲ εντολεϲ εντολαιϲ ο νομοϲ ολοϲ ο νομοϲ κρεμαται και οι προφητε προφηται ·

**English Translation**
On these—these two commandments—the law, the whole law, hangs, and the prophets.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The entirety of the sacred writings depends upon this dual precept as a door depends upon its hinges. The law provides the instruction and the prophets provide the exhortation, yet both are suspended from the single necessity of love. If one removes these two commandments, the rest of the scripture collapses into disconnected rituals and empty statutes, having lost the principle that sustains them.

**Verse 41**
**Greek Text**
ϲυνηγμενων δε των φαριϲεων ε αυτουϲ ο

**English Translation**
And the Pharisees being gathered together, the [One] asked them,

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gathering of the Pharisees signifies a collective counsel of those who rely on the letter, yet they are confronted by the One who questions their understanding. Their assembly, intended for strength in number, becomes the setting for their examination. The questioner takes the initiative, turning the inquiry from legal minutiae to the ultimate identity of the Anointed.

**Verse 42**
**Greek Text**
λεγων τι ϋμ δοκι περι του τι εϲτιν λεγου αυτω δ δ

**English Translation**
Saying: What do you think concerning the [Christ]? Whose [son] is he? They say to him: David’s.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation pierces the veil of flesh to ask of the lineage of the Messiah. The respondents, seeing only the human generation, answer according to the flesh, identifying the Anointed merely as the offspring of David. They grasp the earthly promise but fail to perceive the divine mystery inherent in the nature of the Christ, limiting the Sovereign to the status of a descendant.

**Verse 43**
**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτοιϲ πωϲ ουν δ δ εν καλι αυτον λεγων

**English Translation**
He says to them: How then does David in [spirit] call him [Lord], saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The argument exposes the insufficiency of their answer by citing their own forefather. If the Christ is merely a son by nature, the progenitor would not address him as a superior. The invocation of David calling him [Lord] reveals that the dignity of the Messiah surpasses the authority of the ancestor, implying an existence and dominion that predates the lineage of the king.

**Verse 44**
**Greek Text**
ειπεν τω μ(ου) καθου εκ δεξιων μου εωϲ αν θω τουϲ εχθρουϲ ϲου ϋποκατω των πο ϲου

**English Translation**
The [Lord] said to my [Lord]: Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies under your feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The session at the right hand denotes equality of power and participation in the divine glory. The subjugation of enemies under the feet signifies the final victory of the Kingdom. By identifying two who bear the title of Lord, the text elucidates a mystery of relation within the Godhead, where the One exalted sits beside the One who exalts, awaiting the total pacification of all opposition.

**Verse 45**
**Greek Text**
ει ουν καλι αυ πωϲ αυ εϲτιν

**English Translation**
If therefore [David] calls him [Lord], how is he his [son]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here lies the insoluble knot for those who deny the dual nature. If he is only a son, he cannot be the Lord of his father; if he is the Lord, how can he be the son? The question compels the mind to acknowledge that the Anointed is both the root and the offspring of David, possessing divinity which commands worship and humanity which traces descent.

**Verse 46**
**Greek Text**
και ουδειϲ εδυνατο αποκριθηνε αποκριθηναι αυ λογον ουδε ε τιϲ απ ε τηϲ ημεραϲ επερωτηϲε αυτον ουκετι

**English Translation**
And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to ask him anymore.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The silence of the adversaries serves as a testament to the irresistible wisdom of the Truth. Their inability to answer closes the mouths of the arrogant, proving that human sophistry cannot withstand divine revelation. The cessation of questions marks the end of the testing phase; having been silenced by the Word, they retreat, leaving the authority of the Teacher unchallenged by further interrogation.
