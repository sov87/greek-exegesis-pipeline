**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
βιβλοϲ γενεϲεωϲ · ὑϊου ὑϊου αβρααμʼ

**English Translation**
Book of generation; of Son, of Son of Abraham.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred record opens not with titles of earthly power, but with the assertion of sonship. We encounter a Book of generation that defines the subject solely as the Son of the Son of Abraham. The text anchors the identity of this lineage in the covenantal patriarch, Abraham, and establishes the descent through the repetition of the title "Son." This emphasizes that the one who follows is the true heir of the promise made to Abraham, deriving existence and mission from this foundational root.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
αβρααμʼ ‾̷‾ ε τον ϊ · ιϲακ ϊϲαακ · ιϲαακ δε εγενʼνη τον ϊακωβʼ · ϊα δε εγενʼνηϲ τον ϊουδαν · και τουϲ αδελφουϲ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Abraham ... begat I... Isak Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Ia... begat Judas and his brothers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Abraham stands as the progenitor, the rock from whom the people are hewn. The text presents the succession of Isaac and Jacob with deliberate precision, even amidst scribal pauses, affirming that the promise did not stray. By naming Judas alongside his brothers, the Scripture highlights the unity of the twelve patriarchs while distinguishing the specific branch through which the blessing flows.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ϊουδαϲ δε εγενʼνη τον φαρεϲ · και τον ζαρα εκ τηϲ θα φαρεϲ δε εγενʼ τον εϲρωμ · εϲρωμʼ δε εγεννη τον αραμʼ :

**English Translation**
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Tha...; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The lineage proceeds from Judas through Phares and Zara, mentioning the mother Tha... to remind us of the history of the tribe. The duality of Phares and Zara signifies a fullness in the generation, yet the line continues through Phares to Esrom and Aram. This progression demonstrates the orderly transmission of life through specific, chosen vessels within the tribe of Judas.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
αραμʼ δε εγεννηϲεν τ αμιναδαβʼ ˙ αμινα δε εγεννηϲ τον νααϲϲων · να δε εγενʼνη τον ϲαλμων ·

**English Translation**
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Amina... begat Naasson; and Na... begat Salmon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The genealogy advances through Aram to Aminadab and Naasson, names that carry the history of the people in the wilderness and the entry into the land. The text leads us to Salmon, marking the movement of generations towards the establishment of the kingdom. Each name serves as a living link in the chain that connects the ancient promise to its future fulfillment.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
ϲαλμων δε εγεν τον βοεϲ εκ τηϲ ραχαβ βοεϲ δε εγεννηϲεν τον ϊωβηδ εκ τηϲ ρουθ : ϊωβηδ δε εγεννη τον ϊεϲϲαι ·

**English Translation**
And Salmon begat Boes of Rachab; and Boes begat Iobed of Ruth; and Iobed begat Iessai.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the text explicitly incorporates women of foreign origin, Rachab and Ruth, into the holy line. Salmon begets Boes, and Boes begets Iobed, demonstrating that the grace of the genealogy encompasses those brought in from the nations. The birth of Iessai prepares the way for the anointing of the king, showing that the elect line is woven with threads of Gentile faith.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ϊεϲϲαι δε εγεννη τον τον βαϲιλεα : δαυειδʼ δε ‾̷‾ εγεννηϲεν τον ϲαλομων ϲαλωμωνα εκ τηϲ του ουριου :

**English Translation**
And Iessai begat the the King; and David ... begat Salomon Salomona of her of Urias.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The title "the King" is proclaimed with double force, distinguishing the monarch from all who came before. David is the pivot of this history, yet the text recounts that he begat Salomon Salomona through "her of Urias." This phrasing preserves the memory of the sin and the mercy of God, acknowledging the mother's former bond while affirming the legitimacy of Solomon's succession to the throne.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
ϲολομων ϲα̣λωμων δε εγενʼ τον ροβο · ροβοαμ δε εγεννηϲεν τον αβια · αβιαϲ αβια δε εγεν τον αϲαφ ˙

**English Translation**
And Solomon Salomon begat Robo...; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abias Abia begat Asaph.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The wisdom of Solomon passes to the divided kingdom through Roboam. The succession continues to Abia and then to Asaph. The inclusion of Asaph in the royal list, a name associated with psalmody, reminds us of the spiritual heritage intertwined with the kingly office. The line endures despite the fragility of human rule.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
αϲαφʼ δε εγεννηϲ τον ϊωϲαφατʼ ϊωϲαφατʼ δε εγεν τον ϊωραμʼ ϊωραμʼ δε εγεννη τον οζειαν οζιαν

**English Translation**
And Asaph begat Iosaphat; and Iosaphat begat Ioram; and Ioram begat Ozeian Ozian.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
From Asaph proceeds Iosaphat and Ioram, leading to Ozeian Ozian. The genealogy traverses generations of kings who reigned over the people of God. The mention of these rulers confirms the continuity of the Davidic house, preserving the royal seed through times of turmoil and prosperity alike.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
οζιαϲ δε εγεννη τον ϊωαθαμ · ϊωαθαμ δε εγενʼνη τον αχαϲ αχαζ : αχαϲ δε εγενʼνηϲ τον εζεκιαν

**English Translation**
And Ozias begat Ioatham; and Ioatham begat Achas Achaz; and Achas begat Ezekian.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The succession moves from Ozias to Ioatham, and then to Achas Achaz, a time of testing for the kingdom. Yet from Achas springs Ezekian, a righteous branch. This demonstrates that holiness can emerge from unfaithfulness, as the Lord preserves the line for the sake of the ultimate generation to come.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
εζεκιαϲ δε εγεννη τον μαναϲϲηϲ μαναϲϲη μαναϲϲηϲ μαναϲϲη δε εγεν τον αμωϲ αμωϲ δε εγεννη τον ϊωϲειαν ϊωϲιαν

**English Translation**
And Ezekias begat Manasses Manasse Manasses Manasse; and Manasse begat Amos; and Amos begat Ioseian Iosian.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ezekias begets Manasse, whose name is repeated fourfold in the text, emphasizing the weight of his long and tumultuous reign. From him comes Amos and then Ioseian Iosian, the reformer. The text faithfully records the descent through the kings of Judah, marking the path toward the great exile.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
ϊωϲειαϲ δε εγενʼνη τον ϊεχονιαν και τουϲ αδελφουϲ αυτου επι τηϲ με βαβυλω · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And Ioseias begat Iechonian and his brothers at the mi... of Babylon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Ioseias brings forth Iechonian and his brothers at the critical juncture of the "mi... of Babylon"—the migration or deportation. This marks the end of the independent monarchy and the beginning of the captivity. The mention of brothers alongside Iechonian signifies the collective fate of the royal house as they are uprooted from the holy city.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
μετα δε την μετοι βαβυλωνοϲ ϊεχονιαϲ εγεννη τον ϲαλαθιηλʼ · ϲαλαθιηλ δε εγεν τον ζορο ·

**English Translation**
And after the migra... of Babylon, Iechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zoro...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even in the displacement of Babylon, the line does not perish. Iechonias begets Salathiel, and Salathiel begets Zoro... (Zorobabel). The genealogy survives the loss of the land, proving that the promise is not bound by geography or political power, but resides in the person of the heirs who carry the seed of Abraham back toward restoration.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
ζοροβαβελ δε εγεννηϲεν τον αβιουτ αβιουδʼ : αβιουδʼ δε εγεννηϲεν τον ελιακειμ ελιακειμ δε εγεν τον αζωρ :

**English Translation**
And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
From the restoration of the temple builder Zorobabel, the line descends not into royal pomp, but into the quiet fidelity of Abiud and Eliakim, preserving the sacred promise through generations of ordinary succession.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
αζωρ δε εγεννηϲ τον ϲαδωχ ϲαδωκ : ϲαδωχ ϲαδωκ δε εγεννη τον αχειμ αχιμ : αχειμ αχιμ δε εγεννη τον ελιουτ ελιουδ :

**English Translation**
And Azor begat Sadok; and Sadok begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The names persist—Sadok recalling the priesthood, Achim the establishment—yet here they signify the hidden root of the covenant, waiting dormant in the lineage of Azor and Eliud for the blossoming of salvation.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
ελιουτ ελιουδ δε εγεννη τον ελεαζαρ : ελεαζαρ δε εγεννη τον ματʼθαν · ματʼθαν δε εγεννη τον ϊακωβʼ :

**English Translation**
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
As we approach the mystery, the names Eleazar and Jacob remind us of ancient patriarchs and priests, now converging in Matthan’s line to prepare the immediate family of the Just One.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
ϊακωβʼ δε εγεννη τον ϊωϲηφ τον ανδρα μαριαϲ εξ ἡϲ εγενʼνηθη ὁ λεγομενοϲ · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born the one called [Christ].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the genealogy shifts from begetting to husbanding; Joseph is named not as the natural father but as the husband of Mary, isolating the supernatural birth of the one called Christ from the chain of human seed.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
παϲαι ουν ἁι γενε · απο αβρααμ ˙ εωϲ γενεαι · ‾̷‾ και απο εωϲ τηϲ μετοικεϲιαϲ βαβυλωνοϲ γενε ι ‾̷‾ και απο τηϲ μετοι βαβυλωνοϲ εωϲ του γενε ι ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
All therefore the generations from Abraham until [..] generations [..]; and from [..] until the deportation of Babylon generations ten [..]; and from the deportation of Babylon until the [..] generations ten [..].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The history of salvation is measured in epochs, from the promise given to Abraham, through the judgment of Babylon, moving inexorably toward the fulfillment, marked here by the count of generations which orders time itself for the divine purpose.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
του δε η γενε ὁυτωϲ ην μνηϲ μνηϲτευθειϲηϲ τηϲ μη αυτου μαριαϲ τω ϊωϲηφ πρὶν η ϲυνελθιν αυτουϲ ἑυρέθη εν γαϲτρι εχουϲα εκ α ·

**English Translation**
Now the generation [of him] was thus: Mary his mother having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found having in womb from [Holy Spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The marvel is established by the timeline: the conception occurs during betrothal but before union, proving that that which is in Mary’s womb is not of Joseph’s will but of the power of the Holy Spirit.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
ϊωϲηφ ‾̷‾ δε ὁ ανηρ αυτηϲ δι ὡν και μη θελων αυτην πα δειγματιϲαι παραδειγματιϲαι εβου λαθρα απο αυτην · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And Joseph her husband, being [just] and not willing to make an example of her, intended secretly to [release] her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Joseph’s justice is not a cruelty of the law but a mercy of the heart; unwilling to expose Mary to shame, he seeks a separation that protects her mystery while preserving his own integrity.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
ταυτα δε αυτου εν ϊ αγʼγελοϲ κατ οναρ εφανη αυτω λεγων ϊω μη φοβηθηϲ παραλα μαριαμ την γυναικα ϲου το γαρ εν αυτη γεννη εκ π εϲτιν αγιου

**English Translation**
But while he [thought] on these things, an angel according to a dream appeared to him saying: Jo[seph], fear not to [take] Mary thy wife; for that begotten in her is from [Holy] Spirit.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Human hesitation is answered by divine revelation; the angel dispels fear by revealing the source of the life within her, confirming that what seemed a transgression is in truth the operation of the Holy Spirit.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
τεξεται δε υιον και καλεϲειϲ το ο αυτου ι̣η̣ϲ̣ο̣υ̣ν̣ αυτο̣ϲ̣ γαρ ϲωϲι τον λαον αυτου απο των ἁ ἁυτων ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And she shall bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their [sins].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command to name the child signifies legal paternity and acceptance, while the name Jesus itself declares his mission: he is not merely a teacher, but the Savior who delivers his people from the bondage of their sins.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
τουτο δε ολον γεγο ινα πληρωθη το ρηθεν > δια του προφητου > λεγοντοϲ

**English Translation**
Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet saying:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The events of the Incarnation are not accidental but the completion of the ancient voice; the prophet spoke, and now the reality fulfills the word, binding the old dispensation to the new.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
ιδου η > παρθενοϲ εν > γαϲ γα εξι και τεξετε τεξεται > και καλεϲουϲ > το ονομα αυτου > εμʼμα ὁ εϲτιν με μεθʼ ημων ο · ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Behold, the virgin shall have in womb, and shall bear, and they shall call his name Emma[nuel], which is: With us [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sign of the virgin birth brings forth the reality of Emmanuel; no longer is the Creator distant, but he is now "With us God," abiding in human flesh among his people.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
εγερθειϲ δε ϊωϲηφ απο του ϋπνου ε ὡϲ προϲ αυτω ο αγ και παρε μαριαμ · την γυνε γυναικα αυτου εαυτου ·

**English Translation**
And Joseph having been raised from sleep [did] as the [angel] [commanded] him, and [took] Mary his wife.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Faith acts immediately upon waking; Joseph’s obedience in taking Mary safeguards the virgin mother and legitimizes the Son, completing the earthly preparation for the divine birth.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
και ουκ ε αυτην εωϲ ὁυ ετεκεν ὑϊ ὑϊον ὑϊ και εκαλεϲεν το ονομα αυτου ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And not [knew] her until she bore s- son s- and he called his name ——.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The negation of knowledge preserves the sanctity of the vessel, keeping him separate from her until the fulfillment of the birth. The text surrounds the offspring with the repeated inception of his title, `hyi` `hyion` `hyi`, emphasizing the reality of the Son entering the world through this singular delivery. He bestows the Name, here veiled in the sacred line, signifying a mystery that transcends written speech yet is spoken by him in obedience to the command.
