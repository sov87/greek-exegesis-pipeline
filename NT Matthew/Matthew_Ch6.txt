**Verse 1**
**Greek Text**
προϲεχετε δε την δικαιοϲυ δοϲειν δικ(αι)οϲυνην μη ποιειν εμπροϲ των α προϲ το θεαθηνε αυτοιϲ ει δε μη γε μιϲθον ουκ εχετε παρα τω τω εν τοιϲ ου ου

**English Translation**
Take heed [but] the righteous[ness] to give righteousness not to do before the m[en] toward the to be seen by them; but if not at least, reward you have not with the the [Father] in the heav[ens] heav[ens].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text labors with a holy repetition—"righteousness to give righteousness" and "heavens heavens"—as if the scribe trembles before the magnitude of the command. We see that the act of "giving righteousness" must not be a spectacle for "the men," for the theatrical display nullifies the spiritual substance. The reward resides solely with "the Father" in the highest "heavens," effectively doubled to emphasize their distance from earthly applause.

**Verse 2**
**Greek Text**
οταν ουν ποιηϲε̣ι̣ϲ̣ ποιηϲ ελεημοϲυνην μη ϲαλπιϲηϲ εμ ϲου ωϲ οι ϋποκριται ποιουϲιν εν τεϲ ϲυναγωγεϲ ταιϲ ϲυναγωγαιϲ και εν ταιϲ ρυμαιϲ ο δοξαϲθωϲ των α αμην αμην λεγω απεχουϲ τον μιϲθον αυτ

**English Translation**
Whenever therefore you do you do alms, do not sound a trumpet befo[re] you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues the synagogues and in the streets, th[at] they may be glorified [by] the m[en]; amen amen I say, they have in full the reward of the[m].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The urgency is marked by the stuttering of the action—"you do you do"—implying that the deed is constant, yet the prohibition is absolute. The hypocrites inhabit "the synagogues the synagogues," a redundancy that exposes the hollowness of their location; they occupy the place but miss the spirit. The double "amen" seals their fate: their receipt of the "reward" is total in the present, leaving nothing for the eternal.

**Verse 3**
**Greek Text**
ϲου δε ποιουντοϲ ελαιημοϲυνην μη γνωτω η αριϲτε ϲου τι ποιει η δεξια ϲου

**English Translation**
But of you doing alms, let not the left of you know what the right of you does;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the anatomy of holiness: a severance between the "left" and the "right." The secrecy required is so profound that it divides the self. We do not merely hide the deed from the crowd, but from our own calculation, lest the "right" hand's charity be tainted by the "left" hand's vanity.

**Verse 4**
**Greek Text**
οπωϲ η ϲου ελεημοϲυ η η ελεημοϲυνη εν τω κρυ και ο ϲου ο βλεπων εν τω κρυπτω αποδωϲι ϲοι

**English Translation**
So that may be of you alms the the alms in the secr[et]; and the [Father] of you the [one] seeing in the secret will repay to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text emphasizes "alms the the alms," placing the weight entirely on the act done in the "secret." The divine gaze is defined by its ability to penetrate this "secret." There is no need for a public stage, for the "One of you seeing" is sufficient witness to ensure repayment.

**Verse 5**
**Greek Text**
και οταν προϲευ προϲευχηϲθαι · ουκ εϲεϲθε ωϲ οι οτι φι εν ταιϲ ϲυ και εν ταιϲ γωνιαιϲ τ πλατιων εϲτω προϲευχεϲθε οπωϲ φανωϲιν τοιϲ ανθρωποιϲ αμην λεγω απεχουϲι τον μι αυτων

**English Translation**
And whenever you pray you pray, you shall not be as the [hypocrites], because they lo[ve] in the syn[agogues] and in the corners of the broad streets stand[ing] to pray, so that they may appear to the men; amen I say, they have in full the rew[ard] of them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is doubled—"pray you pray"—demanding intensity. The adversaries "love" not the prayer itself, but the location: the "synagogues" and "corners." Their posture of "standing" is designed only "to appear to the men." Their transaction is complete; they traded piety for visibility and "have in full" a vanishing reward.

**Verse 6**
**Greek Text**
ϲυ δε οταν προϲευχηϲ προϲευχη ειϲελθε ειϲ το τα ϲου και κλι την θυραν ϲου προϲευξε τω π ϲου τω εν τω κρυπτω και ο π ϲου ο βλε εν τω κρυ αποδωϲι ϲοι ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But you, whenever you pray you pray, enter into the cham[ber] of you, and shut[ting] the door of you, pray to the F[ather] of you the [one] in the secret; and the F[ather] of you the [one] see[ing] in the secr[et] will repay to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the instruction stammers with importance: "pray you pray." The movement is inward, into the "chamber," and the action is exclusionary: "shutting the door." This physical enclosure mirrors the spiritual concentration required to address the "Father in the secret." The decoration at the verse's end signals a definitive pause: this is the seal of true devotion.

**Verse 7**
**Greek Text**
προϲευχομενοι δε μη βατταλογη ωϲπερ οι ε ε δοκουϲιν γαρ οτι εν τη πολυ αυτων ειϲα

**English Translation**
Praying but do not babble as the G[entiles] G[entiles]; for they think that in the much sp[eaking] of them they will be hear[d].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The error of the "Gentiles Gentiles" is a redundancy of speech, matching the redundancy of the scribe's text. They rely on "much speaking," assuming the divine ear is captured by volume or quantity. It is a false theology that measures efficacy by word count rather than intent.

**Verse 8**
**Greek Text**
μη ουν ομοιωθητε αυτοιϲ οιδεν γαρ ο ο ϋμων ων χριαν εχετε προ του ϋμαϲ αιτηϲαι αυτον

**English Translation**
Do not therefore be likened to them; for know[s] the the [Father] of you of what things need you have before the you to ask him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We must not imitate them because the "Father of you" possesses foreknowledge. The phrase "the the [Father]" reinforces the singularity of the Divine knowing. He anticipates the "need" before the petition is formed, rendering the babbling of the previous verse utterly futile.

**Verse 9**
**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ ουν προϲ ϋμειϲ ημων ο εν τοιϲ ο αγιαϲθη το ονομα ϲου

**English Translation**
Thus therefore pra[y] you: [Father] of us the [one] in the heav[ens], hallowed be the name of you;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prayer begins by locating the "Father" in the "heavens," establishing the chasm between the petitioner and the Divine. The primary request is not for human need, but for the sanctity of the "name." All prayer must commence with the glorification of God before the needs of man are voiced.

**Verse 10**
**Greek Text**
ελθατω η βαϲιλια ϲου γενηθητω το θε ϲου ωϲ εν ου και επι γηϲ

**English Translation**
Let come the kingdom of you; let be done the wi[ll] of you, as in heav[en], also on earth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "kingdom" and the "will" are parallel forces descending from "heaven" to "earth." The petition seeks a perfect symmetry, where the earthly reality conforms entirely to the heavenly pattern. We ask for the "will" to be executed here as flawlessly as it is there.

**Verse 11**
**Greek Text**
τον αρτον ημων τον επιουϲιον δοϲ ημιν ϲημερον

**English Translation**
The bread of us the substantial give to us today.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We ask for the "bread... the substantial" (epiousion), that which is essential for existence. The limitation "today" anchors our dependence in the immediate present; we do not hoard for the morrow but rely on the daily provision of the Father.

**Verse 12**
**Greek Text**
και αφεϲ ημιν τα οφιληματα ημ ωϲ και ημιϲ αφη αφιαιμεν τοιϲ οφι ημων

**English Translation**
And forgive to us the debts of u[s], as also we forgave forgive to the debt[ors] of us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript struggles here—"forgave forgive"—capturing the perpetual struggle of mercy. We ask for remission of "debts" strictly in proportion to our own action. The stumble in the text reflects the difficulty of the command: our forgiveness of "debtors" is the prerequisite for divine absolution.

**Verse 13**
**Greek Text**
και μη ειϲενεγκηϲ η ειϲ πιραϲμ αλλα ρυϲαι ημαϲ απο του πονηρου : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
And bring [us] not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil [one].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We do not pray for the strength to endure the trial, but for the Shepherd to steer the flock away from the snare entirely. The petition recognizes our frailty; we ask to be snatched from the jaws of the evil [one] rather than be left to battle a power we cannot conquer alone.

**Verse 14**
**Greek Text**
εαν γαρ αφηται τοιϲ α τα παραπτω υτων αυτων αφη και ο ο ουρανιοϲ

**English Translation**
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, the heavenly [One] will also forgive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mercy of the heavens is mechanically linked to mercy upon earth. By releasing the debts of men, the believer unlocks the treasury of the heavenly [One], who mirrors this release; the vertical pardon waits upon the horizontal act.

**Verse 15**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε μη αφητε τοιϲ α ουδε ο αφηϲι τα παραπτωματα ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But if ye forgive not men, neither will the [One] forgive the trespasses.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The refusal to release a brother binds the hands of the Judge against oneself. To hold a grudge is to secure one's own condemnation, for the [One] above operates by the strict measure of reciprocity established by the servant below.

**Verse 16**
**Greek Text**
και οταν δε νηϲτευ μη γινεϲθε ωϲ οι ϲκυ αφανιζου γαρ το προϲωπ τα προϲωπα αυτων οπωϲ φα τοιϲ α νηϲτευοντεϲ αμην γαρ λεγω απεχουϲιν τον μιϲθον αυτων

**English Translation**
And whenever ye fast, become not as the gloomy [ones]; for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men fasting. Amen for I say, they have their reward.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "gloomy [ones]" trade an eternal wage for the coin of human attention. By marring the face to broadcast their piety, they receive their full payment in the fleeting glance of men, leaving nothing stored for the future judgment.

**Verse 17**
**Greek Text**
ϲυ δε νηϲτευων αλι ϲου την κεφα και το προϲω ϲου νιψαι

**English Translation**
But thou, fasting, anoint thy head and wash thy face.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is to mask the spiritual labor with the appearance of daily normalcy. We cleanse the face to hide the hunger, ensuring that the discipline remains a private offering to the invisible realm rather than a public theater for the visible.

**Verse 18**
**Greek Text**
ο μη φανηϲ τοιϲ α νηϲ αλλα τω ϲου τω εν τω κρυφαιω και ο ϲου ο βλεπων τω κρυφεω κρυφαιω απο ϲοι

**English Translation**
That thou appear not to men fasting, but to thy [Father] in the secret [place]; and thy [Father] who seeth in the secret [place] shall repay thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The eyes of men are blind to the secret [place], but the [Father] dwells and observes there. The transaction of grace requires secrecy to ensure the motive is love for the Invisible rather than the praise of the crowd; the repayment is certain because the observation is constant.

**Verse 19**
**Greek Text**
μη θη θηϲαυρουϲ επι τηϲ γηϲ οπου ϲηϲ και βρωϲιϲ αφα και οπου κλε διορυϲϲουϲ και κλεπτουϲιν ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Treasure not treasures upon the earth, where moth and eating destroys, and where thieves dig through and steal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The earth is a realm defined by consumption and intrusion. To store value here is to feed the moth and invite the thief, for nothing under the sun is immune to the slow decay of eating or the sudden violence of digging.

**Verse 20**
**Greek Text**
θηϲαυριζετε δε θηϲαυρουϲ εν ο οπου ου ϲηϲ ουτε βρωϲιϲ αφανιζει και οπου κλεπται ου διορυϲ και κλεπτου

**English Translation**
But treasure treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor eating destroys, and where thieves do not dig through and steal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Security is found only in the heavens, a fortress impenetrable to the thief and sterile to the moth. We transfer our wealth by depositing it where the nature of the realm preserves it eternally, beyond the reach of biological decay or human greed.

**Verse 21**
**Greek Text**
οπου γαρ εϲτ ο θηϲαυροϲ ϲου ε εϲται και η καρ ϲου ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
For where thy treasure is, there will be also thy heart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heart is a captive of its own desires and inevitably migrates to the location of what it values most. To anchor the heart in the heavens, one must first relocate one's possessions to that safe height, for the affection follows the gold.

**Verse 22**
**Greek Text**
ο λυχνοϲ του ϲω εϲτιν ο ο εαν η ο οφθαλμοϲ ϲου α ολον το ϲωμα ϲου φωτι εϲτε

**English Translation**
The lamp of the body is the [eye]; if thy eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The [eye] acts as the portal through which the body receives its illumination. A "single" eye—undivided in purpose and clear in vision—floods the interior man with radiance, leaving no corner for the shadows of duplicity.

**Verse 23**
**Greek Text**
εαν δε η ο οφθαλμοϲ ϲου πονηροϲ ο οφθαλμοϲ ϲου πονηροϲ η ο το ϲωμα ϲου ϲκοτινον εϲται ει ουν το φωϲ το εν ϲοι ϲκοτοϲ ε το ϲκοτοϲ ποϲον ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But if thy eye be evil—thy eye be evil—thy [whole] body shall be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness, how great [is] the darkness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition of the evil eye emphasizes the severity of the condition; the corruption of the intake mechanism ensures the total eclipse of the body. When the very faculty meant to discern light calls darkness "light," the internal darkness becomes absolute and immeasurable.

**Verse 24**
**Greek Text**
ουδειϲ δυναται δυ κυριοιϲ δουλευ ει γαρ τον ενα μιϲηϲι και τον ε αγαπηϲι αγαπηϲει ˙ η ενοϲ ανθεξε και του ετερου καταφρονηϲει ου δυναϲθε δουλευειν και μαμωνα ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
No one can serve two lords; for either the one he will hate, and the [other] he will love; or one he will hold to, and the other he will despise. Ye cannot serve and mammon.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heart cannot be partitioned between opposing masters, for the service of one necessitates the hatred of the other. The text presents a stark impossibility: one cannot bow to the unnamed Lord while simultaneously enslaved to mammon; the rival lordship is total.

**Verse 25**
**Greek Text**
δια τουτο λεγω ϋ μη μεριμνα τη ψυχη τι φαγηται μηδε τω ϲωματι τι εν ουχι η ψυχη πλειον εϲ τηϲ τροφηϲ κ(αι) το ϲωμα του εν

**English Translation**
On account of this I say to you: Do not be anxious for the soul what it might eat, nor for the body what [to put] on. Is not the soul more than the food and the body than the [clothing]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The injunction establishes a hierarchy of value between life and the sustenance that supports it. We observe that the soul, being the seat of life, possesses a dignity far surpassing the meat consumed for its preservation. Likewise, the body, as the vessel of the soul, holds greater worth than the garment used to cover it. To be anxious is to invert this divine order, elevating the lesser necessity of food and raiment above the greater gift of existence itself.

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
εμβλε ειϲ τα πετι του ο ο ου ϲπιρουϲιν ουδε θεριζουϲιν ουδε ϲυναγουϲ ειϲ ταϲ αποθηκαϲ και ο ϋμων ο ουρανιοϲ τρε αυτα ουχ υμειϲ μαλλον διαφερε αυτων

**English Translation**
Look into the birds of the [heaven], [that] they do not sow nor reap nor gather into the storehouses, and the [Father] of you the heavenly feeds them; do you not differ more than them?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The birds of the heaven are presented as witnesses against human anxiety, for they are sustained without the foresight of gathering into storehouses. Their provision comes not from their own toil in sowing or reaping, but directly from the heavenly [Father]. Since you possess reason and are created in the image of God, you differ significantly in rank from these irrational creatures. If the heavenly One sustains the lesser beings who cannot labor, He will surely sustain those of superior nature.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
τιϲ δε ε υμων μεριμν δυναται προϲθει επι την ηλι αυτου πη ενα

**English Translation**
And who of you [by] being anxious is able to add upon his stature one cubit?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Anxiety is revealed here as a powerless exertion of the will, incapable of effecting even a minor change in the physical world. The desire to add a single cubit to one’s stature or age remains unfulfilled despite the intensity of one's worry. This impotence demonstrates that the span and dimension of our life are determined by a power beyond our solicitude. If we cannot control the smallest measure of our physical frame, we must concede control to the One who formed it.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
και περι ενδυματοϲ τι με καταμα τα κρινα του αγρου πωϲ αυξα ου κοπι ουδε νη> · ου ξαινουϲιν ουδε νηθουϲιν ουδε κοπιωϲιν

**English Translation**
And concerning a garment why are you [anxious]? Observe the lilies of the field how [they] grow; [they do] not toil nor spin; they do not card nor spin nor toil.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text directs our gaze to the lilies of the field, specifically noting their lack of industrial labor. We read explicitly that they do not card wool, nor spin thread, nor toil in manufacture, yet they increase in beauty. This absence of human-like effort in their growth signifies that their adornment is a direct act of creation, not a result of production. The believer is taught that divine provision operates independently of the arduous processes of carding and spinning that consume human attention.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
λεγω δε ϋμιν ο ουδε ϲολομ εν παϲη τη δοξη αυτου περιεβαλε ωϲ εν τουτων

**English Translation**
But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Solomon, though possessing the summit of human wealth and royal dignity, is judged inferior in splendor to the wild flora. His glory was external and artificial, whereas the beauty of the lily is intrinsic to its created nature. The comparison humbles the vanity of human apparel, showing that the simplest work of God surpasses the grandest affectations of a king. We learn that true glory is bestowed by the Creator, not achieved through the accumulation of finery.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ϊ δε τον χορτον του αγρου ϲημερον οντα και αυριον ειϲ κλιβανον βαλ ο ου αμφιεννυϲ ου πολλω μαλλ ολιγοπιϲτοι

**English Translation**
And if the grass of the field, being today and tomorrow [is] cast into an oven, the [God] clothes [thus], [will He] not much more [clothe] you, O little-faiths?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The grass is ephemeral, existing for a mere day before serving as fuel for the oven, yet it receives divine adornment. The argument proceeds from the lesser to the greater: if such care is lavished on what is destined for fire, how much more shall it be granted to the rational creature destined for eternity. The rebuke "little-faiths" identifies the root of anxiety not as a lack of resources, but as a deficiency in trust. We assert that doubt regarding physical provision is an insult to the providence that attends even to the perishable grass.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
μη ουν μεριμνη λεγοντεϲ τι φαγωμεν η τι πιωμεν η τι περι

**English Translation**
Therefore do not be anxious saying: What might we eat? or, What might we drink? or, What might we [put] around [us]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prohibition extends to the very articulation of worry regarding the basic necessities of life: food, drink, and clothing. To speak these questions is to give voice to a spirit of distrust that characterizes the faithless. The faithful are commanded to silence these interrogations, refusing to let the tongue express the fear of scarcity. We understand that the silence of the mouth regarding these needs is a discipline that reflects the confidence of the heart.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
ταυτα γαρ παντα τα εθνη επιζητουϲιν οι γαρ δε γαρ ο ο ϋμων οτι χρηζε τουτων απαν των

**English Translation**
For all these things the nations seek after; for the [Father] of you knows that you have need of all these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The anxious pursuit of material goods is the mark of the nations who live without the knowledge of God. Such seeking is alien to the people of God because it denies the omniscience of the [Father]. The text assures us that the [Father] possesses full knowledge of our necessities before we labor to acquire them. To seek with anxiety is to act as though the [Father] is ignorant of the needs of His children, thereby denying His paternal care.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
ζητειτε δε γ̣α̣ρ̣ πρωτον την βαϲι και την δι αυτου και ταυτα παντα προϲτεθηϲεται ϋμιν

**English Translation**
But seek [for] first the Kingdom and the righteousness of Him, and all these things shall be added to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The primary motion of the will must be directed toward the Kingdom and the righteousness of God. This spiritual priority is the condition for the reception of temporal goods, which are promised as an addition rather than a primary goal. By ordering the soul toward the eternal Kingdom, the believer is liberated from the burden of seeking the temporal. We affirm that when the greater good is sought, the lesser goods follow by divine appointment.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
μη ουν με ειϲ την αυριον η γαρ αυριον μεριμνηϲι εαυτηϲ αρκετον τη ημερα η κακια αυτηϲ ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
Therefore do not be [anxious] for the tomorrow; for the tomorrow will be anxious for itself; sufficient to the day [is] the evil of it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We are commanded to confine our concern within the boundaries of the present day. The "evil"—that is, the trouble and affliction—of the current day is a sufficient burden for the soul to bear without adding the weight of the future. To worry about tomorrow is to preemptively suffer clearly defined troubles that have not yet arrived. We teach that grace is given for the day, and to extend anxiety beyond the present is to step outside the temporal order in which obedience is required.
