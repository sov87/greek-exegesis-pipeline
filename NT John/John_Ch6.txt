**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
με ταυτα · απηλθεν ο περαν τηϲ θα τηϲ γαλιλαι τηϲ τιβεριαδοϲ ·

**English Translation**
After these things, the [One] went away beyond the sea of Galilee of Tiberias.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the transition, "After these things." The narrative moves from the disputes in Jerusalem to the open waters. The text here is abrupt; the subject `ο` (the One) stands alone before the preposition, implying the Lord's presence is the antecedent of all action. The sea is named twice: "of Galilee" for the people, "of Tiberias" for the Empire. The Lord crosses "beyond" (`περαν`) these earthly dominions, signifying that the mystery He is about to reveal—the Bread of Life—transcends both Jewish territory and Roman authority.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ηκολουθει δε αυ πολυϲ οχλοϲ · οτι εωρων τα ϲη α εποιει περι των αϲθενουν

**English Translation**
And a great crowd was following him, because they were seeing the signs which he was doing concerning those being sick.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The motivation of the multitude is bound to the senses: they followed because they *saw* (`εωρων`). Their faith is not yet of the spirit, but of the eye. The scribe abbreviates "signs" to `ϲη`, compressing the miraculous into a nomina sacra-like brevity. They seek Him not for who He is, but for what He does "concerning the sick" (`περι των αϲθενουν`). It is the infirmity of the flesh that drives them to the Physician, yet they do not yet know they need the cure for the soul.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και απηλθ ανηλθ δε ανηλθ δε ειϲ το οροϲ ο · και εκι εκαθεζετο μετα των μαθη αυτου .

**English Translation**
And he went away—went up, and went up into the mountain, He; and there he was sitting with his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reveals a struggle in the ascent. The scribe writes `απηλθ` (went away), then corrects to `ανηλθ` (went up), and repeats `ανηλθ δε` (and went up). This stuttering repetition emphasizes the elevation; it is a difficult climb to the spiritual heights. He sits (`εκαθεζετο`) upon the mountain, assuming the posture of the Lawgiver greater than Moses. He is not alone; He is "with his disciples," establishing the Church as the community that dwells on the holy mountain with the Lord.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ην δε εγγυϲ το παϲχα · η εορτη των ϊου ·

**English Translation**
Now the Passover was near, the feast of the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the interpretive key. The temporal marker "Passover" (`παϲχα`) prepares us for the meal to come. The text specifies it is "of the Jews" (`των ϊου`), distinguishing the shadow from the reality. The old Passover is fading; the new Passover, where the Victim is also the Host, is about to be enacted on the grass. The proximity of the feast indicates that the time of fulfillment is at hand.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
επαραϲ ουν τουϲ ο ο και θεαϲαμενοϲ οτι οχλοϲ πολυϲ ερ προϲ αυτον · λεγει προϲ φιλιππ φιλιππ ποθεν αγοραϲω αρτουϲ · ϊνα ουτοι φαγωϲιν

**English Translation**
Therefore having lifted up the [eyes], and having beheld that a great crowd comes to him, he says to Philip, Philip: From where might I buy loaves, that these might eat?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord lifts his "eyes" (abbreviated here as `ο ο`, likely `οφθαλμουϲ`), showing divine oversight. He sees the hunger before the people feel it. He addresses "Philip, Philip"—the repetition in the Codex (whether scribal dithography or emphatic address) heightens the test. The question "From where" (`ποθεν`) is not about geography but origin. Philip looks to the market; Christ looks to Heaven. The goal is simple yet divine: `ϊνα ουτοι φαγωϲιν` (that these might eat).

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
τουτο γαρ δε ελεγεν πιραζων αυτον αυτοϲ δε γαρ ηδει τι εμελλε εμελλεν ποιειν ·

**English Translation**
For this he was saying testing him; for he himself knew what he was about—was about to do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist guards the Lord's omniscience. He was "testing" (`πιραζων`) the disciple, not seeking counsel. The manuscript stutters again at `εμελλε εμελλεν` (was about... was about to do), as if trembling at the foreknowledge of God. The Lord "knew" (`ηδει`). In the economy of salvation, the solution exists before the problem arises. The miracle is already present in the will of the Son before it is engaged by the hands of the disciples.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
αποκρινεται ουν απεκριθη αυτω απεκριθη ουν αυτω ο φιλιπποϲ δια δηναρι αρτοι ουκ αρ · ϊνα εκαϲτοϲ βραχυ τι λαβη ·

**English Translation**
Answers therefore—answered him—answered therefore him Philip: Loaves of two hundred denarii are not sufficient, that each might take a little something.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Confusion reigns in the text and in the disciple. The scribe writes `αποκρινεται` (present), then corrects to `απεκριθη` (aorist), then repeats the phrase. This textual chaos mirrors Philip's flustered calculation. He sees the "two hundred" (`δια` = 200) denarii, a wage of months, yet sees only insufficiency (`ουκ αρ` - are not enough). Human reason calculates scarcity where Divine Grace provides abundance. He hopes only for "a little something" (`βραχυ τι`), underestimating the feast God prepares.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λε αυτω ειϲ εκ τ μαθητων αυτου · ανδρεαϲ ο αδελ ϲιμωνοϲ πε ·

**English Translation**
Says to him one of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Andrew steps forward. The text identifies him relationally: "brother of Simon Peter" (`ϲιμωνοϲ πε`). Even in his own act of faith, he is anchored to the rock of Peter. He is "one of the disciples," representing the voice of the Church that brings the meager offering of the earth to the Creator. He speaks (`λε` - says) into the silence of Philip's despair.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
εϲτιν παιδα ωδε · ο εχει πεντε αρτουϲ κρι · και δυο ο · αλλα ταυτα τι εϲτιν ειϲ τοϲου ˙

**English Translation**
There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but these things, what is it for so many?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The raw materials of the miracle are humble. "Barley" (`κρι` - `κριθινουϲ`) is the bread of the poor and of beasts, symbolizing the Old Law—nutritious but coarse, not yet the finest wheat of the Eucharist. The "two fish" (`δυο ο`) represent the Prophets and the Psalms, or perhaps the vocation of the fishermen. Yet Andrew asks, "What is it for so many?" (`ειϲ τοϲου`). The logic of the world sees the ratio (5 loaves to 5000) as impossible. The logic of the Word sees it as a seed.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ο ποιηϲατε τουϲ αν αναπε · ην δε τοποϲ χορτοϲ πολυϲ εν τω τοπω ανεπεϲαν ουν οι ανδρεϲ τον αρι ωϲ τριϲχι πεντακιϲχιλιοι ·

**English Translation**
The [One] said: Make the m— [men] recline. Now there was a place—much grass in the place. Therefore the men reclined, in number about three thou— five thousand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound textual revelation! The scribe initially writes `τριϲχι` (three thousand), perhaps thinking of the souls added at Pentecost, but corrects it to `πεντακιϲχιλιοι` (five thousand). The number of the saved grows under the pen. They recline on "much grass" (`χορτοϲ πολυϲ`), fulfilling the Psalm: "He makes me lie down in green pastures." The command `ποιηϲατε` (make them do it) enforces order. It is a liturgical arrangement; the chaos of the crowd becomes the order of the congregation.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ελαβεν δε ουν τουϲ αρτουϲ ο και ευ · και εδωκεν τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ οι δε μαθηται τοιϲ ανα · ομοι και εκ των ο οϲον ηθε ·

**English Translation**
And the [One] took the loaves and gave thanks; and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to those reclining; likewise also of the fish as much as they wanted.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Eucharistic prototype. He Took, He Gave Thanks (`ευ` - `ευχαριϲτηϲαϲ`), He Gave. Note the mediation: The Codex explicitly includes `και εδωκεν τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ` (and gave to the disciples), and the disciples to the people. The grace flows from the Head (`ο`), through the hands of the Priesthood (the disciples), to the Body (those reclining). The limitation is removed: they received "as much as they wanted" (`οϲον ηθε`). The scarcity of verse 7 is obliterated by the abundance of the Blessing.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ δε ενε λεγι τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυ · ϲυναγαγεται τα περιϲϲευϲαν κλαϲματα · ϊνα μη τι αποληται ·

**English Translation**
And when they were filled, he says to his disciples: Gather the remaining fragments, that nothing might be lost.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fullness (`ενε` - `ενεπληϲθηϲαν`) is the result of Christ's work. Yet, economy remains. The command to "gather" (`ϲυναγαγεται`) ensures that the holiness of the gift is preserved. "That nothing might be lost" (`ϊνα μη τι αποληται`) echoes the Lord's salvific will for souls—He loses none that the Father has given Him. The fragments are gathered not because the Lord is stingy, but because the Bread of Heaven is too precious to be trampled in the mud.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ϲυνη ουν και εγε δωδεκα κο κλαϲματ · εκ των πεντε αρ των κριθιν · α επεριϲϲευϲεν τοιϲ βεβρωκοϲιν ·

**English Translation**
They gathered therefore and filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five loaves of barley which abounded to those having eaten.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the economy of the miracle: nothing is lost, teaching us reverence for the gifts of God. The number twelve signifies the apostolic fullness—each disciple bears a basket, a burden of evidence that the meager five barley loaves, the food of the poor and the beast, have surpassed the capacity of the multitude. The abundance (*eperisseusen*) testifies that Grace is not merely sufficient, but overflowing.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
οι ουν ανθρωποι ϊδοντεϲ ο εποι ϲημειον ελε · ουτοϲ εϲτιν αληθωϲ ο προφη ο ειϲ τον κοϲμ ερχομενοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
The men therefore, seeing the sign which he did, said: This is truly the prophet, the one coming into the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd perceives the *semeion* (sign) but interprets it through the lens of earthly expectation. They identify Him as "The Prophet" spoken of by Moses, yet their understanding remains tethered to the flesh. They see the bread, but not yet the Bread of Life; they recognize the one "coming into the world," yet do not understand He is not *of* this world.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ουν γνουϲ οτι μελλουϲιν ερχε και αρπαζειν αυτον και αναδι ϊνα ποιηϲωϲιν βαϲιλεα φευγει ανεχωρηϲεν παλιν ειϲ το οροϲ μονοϲ αυτοϲ ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] therefore, knowing that they are about to come and seize him and [show him forth?] in order that they might make [him] king, flees [corrected to: withdrew] again into the mountain, himself alone.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the scribe struggles between *pheugei* (flees) and *anechoresen* (withdrew), revealing the tension of the scene. The Lord rejects the earthly crown to preserve the heavenly one. He retreats to the mountain *monos* (alone), teaching us that true communion with the Father requires withdrawal from the clamor of worldly acclaim. He will not be a king made by men; He is the King who makes men.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ δε οψια εγενετο · κατεβηϲαν οι μα αυτου επι την θαλαϲϲαν ·

**English Translation**
And as evening happened, his disciples went down upon the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The descent (*katebesan*) coincides with the arrival of evening. Spiritually, to go down to the sea—the place of chaos and abyss—without the Light of the World is to enter a time of trial. They descend from the high ground of the miracle to the unstable depths of the waters.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και εμβαντεϲ ειϲ πλοι · ερχονται πε τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ ειϲ καφαρναουμ ˙ κατελαβεν δε αυ η ϲκοτια και ουπω εληλυθει προϲ αυτουϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having embarked into a boat, they come across the sea to Capernaum. And the darkness overtook them, and not yet had [Jesus] come to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound darkness (*skotia*) overtakes them, not merely of the sky, but of their situation. The text notes the absence of the Lord: "not yet had he come." This is the state of the soul in tribulation—surrounded by the dark, laboring at the oars, waiting for the presence that has not yet manifested.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
η τε θαλαϲϲα ανε μεγαλου πνε διηγειρε ·

**English Translation**
And the sea, a great wind blowing, was being aroused.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The elements conspire against them. The sea is "aroused" (*diegeireto*) by the wind (*pneuma*). While the Spirit (Pneuma) breathes life, the winds of the world stir up chaos. The creation groans and becomes hostile when the Creator is absent from the vessel.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
εληλακοτεϲ ο ο ωϲ ϲταδια ϲταδιουϲ ϲταδιουϲ εικοϲι · η τριακον θεωρουϲιν τ περιπατουντα επι τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ και εγγυϲ του πλοι γινομενον · κ(αι) εφοβηθηϲαν

**English Translation**
Having rowed therefore about stadia... stadia... stadia twenty or thirty, they behold [Jesus] walking upon the sea and becoming near the boat; and they were afraid.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe’s repetition of *stadious* mirrors the laborious rowing of the disciples. After struggling for twenty or thirty stadia, the impossible occurs: He treads upon the liquid chaos as if it were solid ground. Their reaction is fear, for the manifestation of the Divine power over nature is terrifying to mortal eyes before it is comforting.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτοιϲ ε ειμι μη φοβι ·

**English Translation**
And he says to them: I am [he]; do not fear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine formula: *Ego eimi* (I AM). He asserts His identity with the very Name of God. The remedy for the fear of the storm is the presence of the I AM. He does not initially calm the sea, but calms the hearts of the disciples; if He is there, the storm does not matter.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ηλθον ουν λαβιν αυτον ειϲ το πλοιον · και ευθε το πλοιον εγενε επι την γην τηϲ γηϲ ειϲ ϋπηντηϲεν ϋπηγον

**English Translation**
They wished therefore to take him into the boat; and immediately the boat happened upon the land... [of the land?] to which they were going.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is garbled, reflecting the confusion of the event, yet the truth shines through: the moment they are willing to receive Him, the journey is accomplished. *Eutheos* (immediately) the goal is reached. Salvation is not a long voyage of works, but the immediate result of receiving Christ into the vessel of one's life.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
τη επαυριον ο οχλοϲ ο εϲτωϲ περαν τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ ειδεν οτι πλοιαριον αλ ουκ ην εκει ει μη εν κεινο ει ο ενεβηϲαν οι μαθηται του εκεινο ειϲ ο ενεβηϲαν οι μαθηται του εν εν κ(αι) κ(αι) οπου οτι ου ϲυνεληλυ ϲυνειϲηλθεν αυτοιϲ τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου ο ειϲ το πλοιαν πλοιον πλοιον αλλα μο οι μαθηται αυ απηλθον

**English Translation**
On the morrow, the crowd standing across the sea saw that another boat was not there except one... [into which his disciples entered... into which his disciples entered...] and that [Jesus] did not enter with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples went away alone.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe’s hand stumbles, repeating lines (*dittography*), witnessing to the frailty of human transmission. Yet the forensic evidence of the crowd remains clear: Jesus was not in the boat. This mystery—how He crossed without a vessel—serves to heighten their wonder and prepares them for the discourse on the Bread regarding His heavenly origin.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
επελθοντων ο ο των πλοιων εκ τι εγγυϲ ︴ ου οπου και του τοπου οπου ε αρτον ευ του

**English Translation**
[Other] boats having come from Tiberias near the place where they ate bread... [after the Lord had given thanks?]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is fragmentary, yet it anchors the narrative geographically (Tiberias) and sacramentally ("where they ate bread"). The scribe marks the location not by its name, but by the miracle performed there. The phrase *eu tou* hints at *eucharistesantos* (giving thanks), reminding us that the blessing of the Lord transforms the material world.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και ϊδοντεϲ οτε ουν ϊδεν ο οχλοϲ οτι ουκ ην εκει ο οτι ουκ εϲτιν εκει ουδε οι μαθη αυτου ανεβηϲαν ενεβηϲαν αυτοι ειϲ το πλοιον τα πλοιαρια και ηλ ειϲ καφαρνα · ζητουντεϲ τον

**English Translation**
When therefore the crowd saw that [Jesus] was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves embarked into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The search is frantic. They utilize the boats from Tiberias to pursue the miracle-worker. Note the correction *anebesan* to *enebesan* (embarked/entered). They seek Him, yet their seeking is flawed; they chase the provider of barley loaves, unaware they are about to confront the demand to eat the Flesh of the Son of Man.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και ευρον αυτον περαν τηϲ θαλαϲϲηϲ ει αυτω ραββει · ποτε ωδε ηλθεϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having found him across the sea, they said to him: Rabbi, when did you come here?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the carnal curiosity of the multitude. They address Him as *Rabbei*, a teacher, yet they interrogate Him regarding time (*pote*) and place (*hōde*). They marvel merely at the logistics of His arrival, blind to the divine manner of His crossing upon the waters. The soul that seeks Christ only to satisfy earthly wonderment misses the mystery of His presence.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτοιϲ και ειπεν αμ αμην λεγω ϋμ ϋμ ζητιται με ουχ οτι ειδετε ϲη · αλλ οτι εφαγε εκ των αρτων και εχορταϲθη :

**English Translation**
He answered them and said: Amen, Amen I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Lord exposes the belly of their intent. He uses the word *echortasthē*, a term often used for the foddering of animals. They sought the filler of stomachs, not the Illuminator of souls. They saw the miracle but perceived not the *sēmeia* (sign); they consumed the matter but tasted not the meaning. We must fear seeking God only for the comfort of our flesh.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
εργαζεϲθαι βρωϲ βρωϲ · μη την απολλυ · αλλα την μενουϲαν ειϲ ζω αιωνιον · ην ο ϋϊοϲ του ανθρω διδωϲιν ϋμ · τουτον γαρʼ ο πατηρ εϲφραγιϲεν ο ·

**English Translation**
Work [not for] the food, the food that perishes; but [for] the one remaining unto life eternal, which the Son of Man gives to you; for him the Father sealed, God.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A command of labor (*ergazesthai*) is given, yet the object is spiritual. The Lord distinguishes between *brōsin* (food) that suffers corruption (*apolly*) and that which remains (*menousan*). The source of this eternal sustenance is the Son of Man, upon whom the Father, God (*Theos*), has set His seal (*esphragisen*). This seal confirms His divine authority to dispense immortality.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ουν προϲ αυτον · τι ποι · ϊν ϊνα εργαζω τα εργα του ·

**English Translation**
They said therefore to him: What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd, hearing the command to work, immediately reverts to the Law, asking for a list of doings (*poi*... *ergazō*). They speak in the plural—*erga* (works)—imagining that the favor of the Divine is purchased through a multitude of observances, rather than a transformation of the heart.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ει αυτοιϲ · του εϲτιν το εργον του ϊνα πιϲτευ ειϲ ον απεϲτι εκεινοϲ ·

**English Translation**
He answered and said to them: This is the work of God, that you believe in whom that one sent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A singular revelation: The many works of the Law are collapsed into one singular *ergon*—Faith. To believe (*pisteu*) is the supreme labor of the soul. It is not merely intellectual assent, but an active trust in the One Sent (*apestilen*) by the Father. Faith is the root from which all true righteousness springs.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν αυτω · τι ποιειϲ ϲημι ϲυ · ϊνα ειδωμεν και πιϲτευϲωμ ϲοι · τι εργαζη ·

**English Translation**
They said therefore to him: What sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What do you work?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the hardness of the human heart. Having just been fed by a miracle, they demand yet another *sēmeion* (sign). They bargain with the Almighty: "Let us see (*idōmen*), and then we will believe." True faith trusts before it sees; these demand sight as a condition for trust, mocking the very Provider standing before them.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
οι πατερεϲ ημων το μαννα εφαγ εν τη ερημω κα εϲτιν γεγραμ αρτον εκ του ου δεδωκεν αυτοιϲ φαγειν ·

**English Translation**
Our fathers ate the manna in the desert, as it is written: Bread out of heaven he gave them to eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They retreat to tradition and Scripture to challenge the Living Word. Citing the Psalm, they glorify the manna of the wilderness, a physical type. They anchor their hope in the *pateres* (fathers) and the past, unable to recognize that the Reality to which the manna pointed is now speaking to them.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν αυτοιϲ ο αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν · ου μω δεδωκεν τον αρτον εκ του ουρανου · αλλ ο πατηρʼ μου διδω ϋμιν τον αρ εκ του ουρα τον αληθιν ·

**English Translation**
He said therefore to them: Amen, Amen I say to you, not Moses gave you the bread out of heaven; but my Father gives you the bread out of heaven, the true [bread].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ corrects their theology on two fronts. First, the agent was not Moses (*Mō*), but the Father. Second, the gift was not merely in the past (*dedōken*), but is given now in the present (*didōsin*). He introduces the adjective *alēthinon*—the True Bread. The manna was but a shadow; the reality is here.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ο γαρ αρτοϲ ο του εϲτιν ο κατα εκ του ου · και ζωην διδουϲ τω κοϲμω ·

**English Translation**
For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven, and gives life to the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The definition of the Divine Bread is established: Origin and Effect. Its Origin is the descent (*katabainōn*) from the heavens; its Effect is the donation of life (*zōēn didous*). Unlike the manna which fed only Israel, this Bread gives life to the entire *kosmos* (world). It is universal and incarnational.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ουν προϲ αυτον · παντοτε δοϲ ημιν τον αρτον τουτον ·

**English Translation**
They said therefore to him: Always give us this bread.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Like the Samaritan woman at the well, they desire the gift but misunderstand its nature. They say "always" (*pantote*), thinking of a perpetual supply of physical sustenance to avoid the labor of baking. Their minds are yet tethered to the earth, desiring the gift without knowing the Giver.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ ο εγω ειμι ο αρ τηϲ ζωηϲ · ο ερχομενοϲ προϲ εμε · ου μη πινα · και ο πιϲτευ ειϲ εμε ου μη διψηϲει πωποτε ·

**English Translation**
He said therefore to them: I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger; and he who believes in me shall not thirst ever.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The great revelation: *Egō eimi* (I am). He does not merely give the bread; He *is* the Bread. The cure for the soul's famine is proximity ("comes to me") and trust ("believes in me"). The promise is absolute: the cessation of hunger (*peinasē*) and thirst (*dipsēsei*), fulfilling the deepest void of the human condition.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ειπον οτι και εωρακατε και ου πιϲτευεται ·

**English Translation**
But I said [to you] that you have even seen [me], and you do not believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A lament over the visible but unrecognized. They have the beatific vision before their very eyes—they have seen (*heōrakate*) the Incarnate Word—yet they remain in unbelief. Sight alone does not save; the eye of the heart must be opened by grace to perceive the Divinity veiled in flesh.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
παν ο διδωϲιν μοι ο πατηρʼ προϲ εμε ηξει · και τον ερχομενον προϲ εμε ου μη εκβαλω εξω

**English Translation**
All that the Father gives me will come to me; and the one coming to me I will certainly not cast out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine economy of salvation: the soul is a gift from the Father to the Son. The verb *διδωϲιν* (gives) is present, indicating a continuous offering of the elect. The promise is absolute: *ηξει* (will come). There is no uncertainty in the divine transaction. Furthermore, the Lord uses the double negative *ου μη* (certainly not) regarding rejection. Let no penitent despair, for the Son’s will is to receive what the Father bestows; to cast out the penitent would be to reject the Father’s gift, which is impossible for the obedient Son.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
οπου οτι καταβεβη εκ του ουρανου ουχʼ ποιηϲω το θελημα το εμον αλλα το θελημα του πεμψαντοϲ με

**English Translation**
Because I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of the one who sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the refutation of those who divide the will of the Godhead. The Son descends (*καταβεβη*) not to establish a rival kingdom, but to manifest the single divine will in human flesh. When He speaks of "my own will" versus the Sender's, He speaks regarding his assumed humanity, which naturally shrinks from suffering, yet is perfectly subjected to the Divine purpose. The origin (*εκ του ουρανου*) dictates the mission; He who is from heaven brings the order of heaven to earth.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
τουτο δε εϲτιν το θελημα του πεμψαντοϲ με ϊνα παν ο δε μοι μη α εξ αυτου αλλα αναϲτηϲω αυτο εν τη εϲχα ημερα ·

**English Translation**
And this is the will of the one who sent me, that all which [he has given] me, [I should not lose] of it, but raise it up in the last day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is abbreviated (*μη α* for *μη απολεσω*), yet the meaning is potent. The Father's will is preservation. The Son is the Guardian of the gift. The phrase *εξ αυτου* (of it) suggests the entirety of the body of believers—not a bone shall be broken, not a soul lost. The specific mention of *τη εϲχα ημερα* (the last day) confirms the bodily resurrection. Salvation is not merely the survival of the spirit, but the restoration of the whole man at the end of the age.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
τουτο γαρ εϲτιν το θελη του πατροϲ μου · ϊνα παϲ ο θεωρ θεωρ τον και πιϲτευ ειϲ αυτον εχη ζωην αιωνιον · και αναϲτηϲω αυ εγω εν τη εϲχα ημερα ·

**English Translation**
For this is the will of my Father: that everyone seeing [seeing] the [Son] and believing in him should have eternal life; and I myself will raise him up in the last day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *θεωρ* (seeing), perhaps an error, yet spiritually it emphasizes the gaze of faith. It is not enough to glance; one must behold. Note the progression: seeing leads to believing (*πιϲτευ*), and believing results in *εχη ζωην* (having life). The life is possessed now, in the present tense, but its consummation is the future resurrection, enacted by the emphatic *εγω* (I myself). Christ is the active agent of our rising; we do not rise naturally, but are pulled upward by Him.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
εγογγυζον ουν οι ϊουδαιοι περι αυ · οτι ειπεν εγω ειμι ο αρτοϲ ο κα εκ του ουρα ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews were murmuring about him, because he said: I am the bread [coming down] from heaven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
*Εγογγυζον* (they were murmuring): this is the sound of the wilderness generation, the noise of unbelief. They stumble at the mystery of the Incarnation. They see the man, but reject the "bread from heaven" (*αρτοϲ... εκ του ουρα*). The carnal mind cannot comprehend how the spiritual descends into the material. They look for manna on the ground, but reject the Manna standing before them.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και ελεγον ουχ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο ϊωϲηφʼ ὁυ ημιϲ οιδαμεν και τον πατερα κ(αι) την μ πωϲ ουν ουτοϲ λεγει ε εκ του ουρανου καταβεβηκα ˙

**English Translation**
And they were saying: Is this not the [son] of Joseph, whose father we know and the mother? How therefore does this one say [that] I have come down from heaven?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Familiarity breeds blindness. They claim knowledge (*οιδαμεν*—we know) of his earthly lineage, citing Joseph and the mother (*την μ*), and this false knowledge blocks the revelation of his true Paternity. They judge by the flesh. Because they know the vessel, they deny the contents. It is a warning to us: we must not let the humanity of the Church or the Sacraments blind us to their divine origin.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ουν αυ και ειπεν · μη γογγυζεται μετ αλ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [Jesus] answered [them] and said: Do not murmur with one another.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord commands silence to the dissent. *Μη γογγυζεται* (Do not murmur) is an imperative. Their conversation is *μετ αλ* (with one another), a horizontal communion of doubt. As long as they speak only to each other, they reinforce their blindness. They must stop speaking to men if they are to hear God.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
ουδιϲ δυ ελθιν προϲ με εαν μη ο πα ο πεμψαϲ με ελκυϲη αυτον · κα αναϲτηϲω αυ τη εϲχατη η ·

**English Translation**
No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up in the last day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the crushing of human pride. *Ουδιϲ δυ* (no one is able): the capacity for salvation does not reside in the human will. It requires the Father to *ελκυϲη* (draw/drag) the soul. This drawing is the prevenient grace of God. Yet, the operations of the Trinity are inseparable; the Father draws, but the destination is the Son ("to me"), and the Son executes the final victory (*αναϲτηϲω* - I will raise).

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
εϲτι γεγραμμεν εν τοιϲ προφηταιϲ · και εϲονται παν διδακτοι · παϲ ο ακουϲαϲ πα του πατροϲ και μαθων · ερχεται προϲ εμε ·

**English Translation**
It is written in the prophets: And they shall all be taught [of God]; everyone having heard from the Father and having learned comes to me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled. The teaching (*διδακτοι*) is no longer mediated solely by law, but is an inward illumination. Note the criteria for true learning: *ακουϲαϲ* (hearing) and *μαθων* (learning/understanding). The proof that a man has truly been taught by the Father is that he comes to Christ. One cannot claim to know the Father while rejecting the Son, for the Father's lesson *is* the Son.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ουχ ο τον πατερα εω τιϲ · ει μη ο ων παρα του πατροϲ · ουτοϲ εωρακεν τον

**English Translation**
Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the one being from the Father; this one has seen the [Father].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A distinction of essence. We learn by hearing; the Son knows by seeing (*εωρακεν*). No created being has direct vision of the Divine Essence. Only He who is *παρα του πατροϲ* (from the Father)—begotten, not made—possesses this immediate sight. Therefore, Christ is the sole authentic revealer of the Father, for He alone speaks from vision, while prophets speak from inspiration.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι ο πιϲτευ εχει ζωην αιωνιον

**English Translation**
Amen, amen, I say to you that the one believing has eternal life.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double *αμην* signals absolute, unshakeable truth. The condition is faith (*ο πιϲτευ*), and the result is immediate possession: *εχει* (he has). It is not "will have" in the distant future, but "has" in the reality of grace. Eternal life begins the moment the soul adheres to Christ in faith.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
εγω ει ο αρτοϲ τηϲ ζω ·

**English Translation**
I am the bread of life.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The great identification. *Εγω ει* (I am). He does not merely dispense the bread; He *is* the bread. The genitive *τηϲ ζω* (of life) indicates that He is the source and sustainer of all vitality. As bread is necessary for the body, so Christ is necessary for the soul. Without Him, there is only hunger and death. He offers His very self as the sustenance of the world.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
οι πατερεϲ ϋ εφαγον το μαννα εν τη ερη · και απεθαν ·

**English Translation**
Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; and died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the stark contrast, beloved. The Lord points to the history of our people, acknowledging the miracle of the manna, yet immediately highlighting its insufficiency. The abbreviation `ϋ` (for *hymōn*—your) distances the hearers from the patriarchs in this moment of judgment. They ate bread from the sky, yet they remained subject to mortality in the `ερη` (wilderness). The final word `απεθαν` (died) stands as a tombstone over the old covenant; physical sustenance cannot remedy the spiritual famine of the fall.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο αρ ο εκ του ουρα καταβαιν · ϊνα τιϲ εξ αυτου φαγη και μη απο :

**English Translation**
This is the bread coming down out of heaven; that someone may eat of it and not die.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the remedy to the mortality of the fathers. The Lord identifies Himself not merely as bread, but as the Bread `καταβαιν` (descending)—a continuous action of the Incarnation. The purpose of this descent is singular: that the one eating might not suffer the ultimate death. The text breaks off at `απο` (die), as if the very mention of death is cut short by the power of this heavenly bread. It is the food of immortality.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
εγω ειμι ο αρτοϲ ο ζων ο εκ του ου καταβαϲ · ε τιϲ φαγη εκ του εμου αρτου · ζηϲει ειϲ τον αιωνα κ(αι) ο αρτοϲ ον εγω δω ϋπερ τηϲ του κοϲμου ζωηϲ η ϲαρξ μου εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
I am the living bread having come down out of heaven; if anyone eats of my bread, he shall live into the age; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark this transition well. He moves from "bread" to "flesh" (`ϲαρξ`). The Codex here preserves a specific reading: `εκ του εμου αρτου` (of *my* bread), emphasizing His sovereign possession of this gift. It is not merely bread *from* God, but the bread that *is* God. The phrase `ϋπερ τηϲ του κοϲμου ζωηϲ` (on behalf of the life of the world) signals the sacrificial nature of this flesh; it is given in death so that the cosmos might recover life.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
εμαχοντο ουν προϲ αλληλουϲ οι ϊου λεγοντεϲ · πωϲ ουν δυναται ημιν ουτοϲ δου την ϲαρκα φα ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews were fighting with one another saying: How is this one able to give us the flesh to eat?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The carnal mind stumbles upon the spiritual mystery. The verb `εμαχοντο` (they were fighting) suggests violent disputation, not mere confusion. The abbreviation `ϊου` (Jews) here represents those who look only at the surface. They ask "How?" (`πωϲ`), seeking a mechanism of nature, whereas the Lord speaks of a mechanism of grace. They see cannibalism where faith sees communion.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ ο · αμην αμην λεγω · αν μη φαγηται την ϲαρ του του αν · και πιη το αιμα αυτου · ουκ εχετε ζωην αιωνιον εν εαυ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [Jesus] said to them: Amen amen I say: Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you do not have eternal life in yourselves.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord does not soften the hard saying; He intensifies it with the double "Amen." The scribe abbreviates the sacred title `του του αν` (of the Son of Man), veiling the mystery even as it is proclaimed. The addition of "drink his blood" (`πιη το αιμα`) is the final severance from the Levitical law, which forbade the consumption of blood. Christ declares that life is no longer in the blood of the animal, but in the blood of the Incarnate Word. Without this participation, you are empty vessels, having no life `εν εαυ` (in yourselves).

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
ο τρωγων μου τ τ ϲαρκα και πιν μου το αιμα εχει ζωην αιωνιον · καγω αναϲτηϲω αυτον τη εϲχατη ημερα

**English Translation**
The one gnawing my flesh and drinking my blood has eternal life; and I will raise him up on the last day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verb changes from *phagein* (to eat) to *trōgōn* (gnawing/chewing), a visceral, physical word. The scribe stammers with `τ τ` before `ϲαρκα`, perhaps trembling at the realism of the command. This is no metaphor. The promise is twofold: present possession of `ζωην αιωνιον` (eternal life) and future `αναϲτηϲω` (resurrection). The Eucharist is the seed of the resurrection planted in the mortal body.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
η γαρ ϲαρξ μου αληθηϲ εϲτιν βρωϲιϲ και το αι μου αληθωϲ αληθηϲ αληθωϲ εϲ ποτον ποϲιϲ ·

**English Translation**
For my flesh is true food and my blood [is] truly true truly drink.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the struggle of the scribe in the text itself—`αληθωϲ αληθηϲ αληθωϲ` (truly true truly)—as if language fails to capture the absolute reality of this food. Unlike the manna which was a shadow, this is the substance. The repetition emphasizes that this is the only food that truly feeds the inner man. The blood (`αι`) is not a symbol of death, but the true drink (`ποϲιϲ`) of immortality.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
ο τρωγ μου την ϲαρκα και πινων μου το αιμα εν εμοι μενει καγω εν αυ ·

**English Translation**
The one gnawing my flesh and drinking my blood remains in me and I in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the doctrine of mutual indwelling. By consuming the Holy Mysteries, the distance between Creator and creature is bridged. `εν εμοι μενει` (he remains in me)—this is the stability of the Christian life. We become Christ-bearers (Christophores), and He becomes the very constitution of our being. The abbreviation `αυ` (him) signifies the believer who has been subsumed into the life of the Son.

**Verse 57**

**Greek Text**
καθωϲ απε με ο ζων π · καγω ζω δι τον · και ο τρω με κακεινοϲ ζηϲει δι εμε ·

**English Translation**
Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father; also the one gnawing me, that one also shall live because of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the hierarchy of life, descending from the unbegotten `π` (Father). The Son lives `δι τον` (because of the Father)—an eternal generation, not a creation. In parallel, the communicant lives `δι εμε` (because of me, Christ). The Eucharist draws the believer into the trinitarian dynamic of life. We live by Christ as Christ lives by the Father.

**Verse 58**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο αρτοϲ ο εκ του ουρανου κα καταβαϲ · ου κα οι πατερεϲ εφαγον και απε · ο τρωγ τουτον τον αρτ · ζηϲει ειϲ τον αι :

**English Translation**
This is the bread which came down out of heaven; not as the fathers ate and died; the one gnawing this bread shall live into the age.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The discourse concludes by returning to the beginning. The comparison is finalized: the fathers ate and `απε` (died). Their food was of the earth, though it fell from the sky. This bread, which is the Lord Himself, grants life `ειϲ τον αι` (into the age/eternity). The scribe's stutter `κα καταβαϲ` underscores the motion of descent—the humility of God that elevates man.

**Verse 59**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπεν εν ϲυ ϲ διδαϲκ εν καφαρναουμ ˙

**English Translation**
These things he said in a synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
These mysteries were not whispered in secret but proclaimed in the `ϲυ` (synagogue), the place of gathering. Capernaum, the village of comfort, becomes the place where the true Comforter is revealed as food. The teaching (`διδαϲκ`) is liturgical; it replaces the reading of the Law with the feeding on the Word.

**Verse 60**

**Greek Text**
πολλοι ουν ακου εκ των μαθητων αυτου ειπον · ϲκληροϲ εϲτιν ο λογοϲ ου · τιϲ δυναται αυτου ακουειν

**English Translation**
Therefore many of his disciples, having heard, said: Hard is this word; who is able to hear it?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The reaction to the mystery is rejection. "Hard" (`ϲκληροϲ`) means harsh, offensive, impossible to accept. It is not that they do not understand the grammar; they understand the claim to divinity and the demand for total participation, and they recoil. The flesh cannot bear the weight of such glory. They ask "who is able?"—indeed, no one is able, save by the drawing of the Father.

**Verse 61**

**Greek Text**
εγνω ουν ϊδωϲ δε ο εν ε οτι γογγυ περι του οι μαθηται αυτου · και ειπεν αυτοιϲ τουτο ϋ ϲκανδαλιζι ·

**English Translation**
Knowing therefore—Jesus [knowing] in [himself] that his disciples murmur concerning this—and he said to them: Does this offend you?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the Lord’s omniscience; the text reads *en e* [en eautō], indicating He perceived their dissent within Himself, needing no external report. The scribal abbreviation *gongy* captures the low, guttural sound of their murmuring—an earthly noise against heavenly doctrine. He confronts them directly: *skandalizei* (does it trip you up?). The mystery of the Eucharist acts as a stumbling block to the carnal mind, sifting the true wheat from the chaff.

**Verse 62**

**Greek Text**
εαν ουν θεωρηται αναβενοντα τ του ανθρωπου οπου ην το προ ·

**English Translation**
If therefore ye behold ascending the [Son] of Man where he was the former [time]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord answers the scandal of the Flesh with the glory of the Ascension. The text presents a conditional vision: if the descent of the Bread offended them, how shall they endure the ascent of the *Son of Man*? The phrase *to proteron* (the former) is a dogmatic bulwark of His pre-existence; He returns only to where He already was, affirming He is God from God before He became Man.

**Verse 63**

**Greek Text**
το π εϲτιν το ζωοποιουν · η ϲαρξʼ ουκ ωφελει ουδεν · τα ρηματα α εγω λελαληκα ϋ · π π εϲτιν και ζωη ·

**English Translation**
The Spirit is the [one] making alive; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you, Spirit [Spirit] is and life [is].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the hermeneutical key. Flesh without the *Pneuma* (Spirit) is dead matter; it is the Spirit that vivifies the Sacrament. The Codex emphasizes *Pneuma*—perhaps doubled by the scribe or simply emphatic—to show that Christ’s words (*rhemata*) are not empty sounds but substantial power. They do not merely describe life; they *are* Spirit and Life.

**Verse 64**

**Greek Text**
αλλ εξ ϋμων ειϲιν τινεϲ · οι ου πιϲτευουϲιν ηδει γαρ απ αρχηϲ ο ϲω τινεϲ ειϲιν οι πιϲτευοντεϲ · και τιϲ ην ο μελλων αυ παραδιδοναι ·

**English Translation**
But there are some of you who do not believe. For the Savior knew from the beginning who are the believing ones, and who was the [one] about to betray him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text uses the nomina sacra *SW* (Soter/Savior) rather than the usual *IS* (Jesus), emphasizing His role as Savior even while acknowledging those who reject salvation. His knowledge is *ap archēs* (from the beginning). He did not discover the traitor by surprise; He endured him by design. The distinction is clear: there are "believing ones" and there is the betrayer.

**Verse 65**

**Greek Text**
και ελεγεν · δια του ειρηκα ϋμιν ο ουδιϲ δυναται ελθειν προϲ εμε · εαν μη ῆ δεδομε αυτω εκ του πατροϲ ·

**English Translation**
And he said: Because of this I have said to you that no one is able to come to me, if it be not given to him from the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This verse crushes human arrogance. The ability (*dynatai*) to approach the Son is not inherent in our nature but is a gift (*dedomenon*) from the Father. Faith is not a conquest of the intellect but a concession of grace. If one falls away, it reveals that the drawing of the Father was resisted or not fully received.

**Verse 66**

**Greek Text**
εκ τουτου ουν πολ των μαθητ μαθητ απηλθον ειϲ τα οπιϲω · και ουκε μετ αυτου περι ·

**English Translation**
From this therefore many of the disciples [disciples] went away to the [things] behind, and no longer walked with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A tragic turning point. The scribal repetition of *mathet* (disciples) underscores the horror: these were not strangers, but *disciples* who abandoned the Light. They went *eis ta opisō* (to the things behind)—returning to the world and its shadows. They walked no longer with the Living Word, choosing the silence of spiritual death.

**Verse 67**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν ο τοιϲ δω · μη και ϋμιϲ θελεται ϋπαγειν ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the [Lord] said to the twelve: Do ye also wish to go away?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord constrains no one. He turns to the Twelve (*tois dōdeka*) with a question that pierces the will: *Thelete* (do you wish/will?). Salvation requires voluntary adherence. He tests the remnant to see if their fidelity is based on crowd consensus or conviction of truth.

**Verse 68**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτω ϲι πετροϲ · προϲ τινα απελευ · ρηματα ζωηϲ αιωνιου ε ·

**English Translation**
Simon Peter answered him: To whom shall we go? Words of eternal life thou hast.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter speaks as the mouth of the Church. He does not say "where" but "to whom" (*pros tina*). The world offers places; Christ offers a Person. He confesses that the *rhemata* (utterances) of Jesus are not merely instructional but possess the substance of *zoes aioniou* (eternal life).

**Verse 69**

**Greek Text**
και ημιϲ πε κ(αι) εγνωκαμεν · οτι ϲυ ει ο αγιοϲ του ·

**English Translation**
And we have believed and have known that thou art the Holy One of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the order: *pepisteukamen* (we have believed) precedes *egnokamen* (we have known). Faith leads to understanding. The Codex Sinaiticus preserves a distinct confession: *Ho Hagios tou [Theou]* (The Holy One of God), identifying Him as the Sanctified One, set apart by the Father, rather than the later harmonization of "Christ, Son of the Living God."

**Verse 70**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ειπεν αυτοιϲ · ουχι εγω ϋμαϲ ε τουϲ δω και ειϲ εξ ϋμ διαβολοϲ εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
He answered and said to them: Did I not choose you the twelve? And one of you is a devil.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful rebuke to Peter’s confident "we." The Lord affirms the election of the Twelve (*tous dōdeka*) yet reveals a mystery of iniquity within the fold. He calls the traitor a *diabolos*—not merely possessed, but an adversary in function. Election to office does not guarantee the state of the soul.

**Verse 71**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν δε τον ϊουδ ϲιμωνοϲ απο καρυωτου ϊϲκαριωτου · ουτοϲ γαρ και εμελλον εμελλεν αυτον παραδιδο · ειϲ ων εκ τ δωδεκα :

**English Translation**
Now he spoke of Judas [son] of Simon from Karyot [Iscariot]; for this [one] was about to betray him, being one of the twelve.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles with the terrible name, writing *apo Karyotou* (from Karyot) and then the familiar *Iskariotou*, elucidating the man's origin. The phrase *emellon emellen* shows a correction, hesitating over the act of betrayal. The final sting is the phrase *eis on ek ton dōdeka* (being one of the twelve). The proximity to the Holy One did not save him; he ate the Bread of Life and lifted his heel against it.
