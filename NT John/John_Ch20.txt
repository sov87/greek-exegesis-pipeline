**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
τη δε μια των ϲαβ μαριαμʼ η μαγδαληνη ερχε πρωϊ · ϲκοτιαϲ ︴ ε ουϲηϲ ειϲ το μνη · και βλεπει τον λιθον ηρμεν απο τηϲ θυραϲ εκ του μνημιου

**English Translation**
Now on the first [day] of the sabbaths, Mariam the Magdalene comes early, darkness still being [present], to the *mnemeion* [tomb]; and she sees the stone taken away from the door out of the *mnemeion*.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, how the Evangelist marks the "first of the sabbaths," initiating the new creation. The text reads *skotias* (darkness) was still present; this is not merely the absence of the sun, but the spiritual shadow before the light of Resurrection is fully perceived by the soul. Mariam approaches the *mnemeion*—a place of memory—only to find the stone "lifted" (*ermenon*). The prepositional force here is heavy: moved *apo* (away from) the door and *ek* (out of) the tomb, signifying a total unsealing of death's enclosure.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
τρεχει ο ο · και ερχεται προϲ τ ϲιμωνα πετρον · και προϲ τον αλλ μαθητην ον εφι ο · και λεγει αυ · ηραν τον εκ του μνημιου · και ουκ οιδαμεν που εθηκαν αυτον ·

**English Translation**
She runs [therefore], and comes to Simon Petros, and to the other disciple whom [Jesus] loved, and says to them: They took the [Lord] out of the *mnemeion*, and we know not where they placed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here bears the marks of haste, much like the Magdalene herself. The text reads "runs *o o*"—likely a scribal stutter for *oun* (therefore)—and the object of her affection is abbreviated "whom *efi o*" (loved [the Lord]). Notice the distress in her proclamation: "They took the [one]..." The text lacks the specific title *Kyrion* (Lord) in this specific line, perhaps reflecting the breathless, fragmented nature of her report. She confesses ignorance ("we know not"), a necessary precursor to the revelation of faith.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
εξηλ ουν ο πετροϲ και ο αλλοϲ μαθη κ(αι) ηρχοντο ειϲ το μνημιον

**English Translation**
Went out therefore Petros and the other disciple and were coming to the *mnemeion*.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The authority of the Church (Peter) and the beloved disciple move together. The verb *exelthen* (went out) is singular, focusing on Peter as the leader, yet the plural *erchonto* (were coming) follows, showing their communion in seeking the Lord. They leave the city of men to seek the Living among the dead.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και ετρεχον ετρεχον δε οι δυο ομου κ(αι) ο αλλοϲ μαθητηϲ προε δε ταχιον του πετρου και ηλ ειϲ το μνημι πρωτοϲ ·

**English Translation**
And they were running, running [indeed] the two together; and the other disciple ran forward faster than Petros and came to the *mnemeion* first.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *etrechon* (running, running), emphasizing the intensity of their zeal. Love, represented by the other disciple, is swifter than authority, represented by Peter. Love arrives at the mystery first. The abbreviation *proe* suggests *proedramen* (ran ahead). In the spiritual race, affection often outpaces intellect, arriving at the threshold of the divine mystery before understanding catches up.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και παρακυ · βλεπει τα οθο κειμενα · ου μεντοι ειϲηλθεν

**English Translation**
And stooping down, he sees the linen cloths lying; yet he did not enter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The beloved disciple stoops (*paraky*)—a posture of humility and scrutiny. He sees the *othonia* (linens) lying flat. Why does he not enter? It is a hesitation of reverence, or perhaps he waits for Peter, preserving the order of the body of Christ. He sees the evidence of the absence, but not yet the presence.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ερχεται ουν και ϲιμ πετροϲ ακολουθων αυτω και ειϲηλθεν ειϲ το μνημιον και θεω τα οθονια κειμενα

**English Translation**
Comes therefore also Simon Petros following him, and entered into the *mnemeion* and beholds the linen cloths lying.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter arrives and enters immediately. His boldness is characteristic. He *theorei* (beholds/scrutinizes) the linens. This is a more intense gaze than the *blepei* (sees) of the previous verse. He is examining the physical evidence of the miracle: the grave clothes are present, but the body they wrapped is gone. This distinguishes the Resurrection from a theft; thieves would not strip the body and leave the wrappings.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και το ϲουδαριον ο ην επι τηϲ κεφαληϲ αυτου · ου μετα των οθονιων κειμεν κειμεν · αλλα χωριϲ εντετυ · ειϲ ενα τοπον ·

**English Translation**
And the *soudarion* [face-cloth] which was upon his head, not lying, lying with the linen cloths, but apart wrapped up in one place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the proof of divine deliberation. The *soudarion*, the cloth for the head, is separate. The scribe's repetition of *keimen* (lying, lying) underscores the placement. It is *entetuligmenon* (wrapped/rolled up) in one place. The chaotic haste of grave robbers is absent. The Lord arose with the same calm with which He slept in the boat; He has set aside the garments of mortality with order and precision.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
τοτε ουν ειϲηλθεν και ο αλ μαθητηϲ ο ελ πρωτοϲ ειϲ το μνημιον · και ειδεν και επιϲτευ ·

**English Translation**
Then therefore entered also the other disciple who came first to the *mnemeion*, and he saw and believed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Now Love enters, following Authority. The beloved disciple sees the order of the empty tomb and *episteusen* (believed). What did he believe? Not merely that the body was gone, but that the Lord had risen. Faith is kindled by the sight of the empty signs of death.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ουδεπω γαρ ηδει ηδειϲαν την γραφην · οτι δει αυτον εκ νε αναϲτηναι ·

**English Translation**
For not yet did they know [knew] the scripture, that it behoves him to rise from [the] dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stammers here—*edei edeisan* (knew, they knew)—reflecting the confusion of the moment. Until this instant, the prophecy was a sealed book to them. The necessity (*dei*) of the Resurrection was written in the Law and Prophets, but it required the empty tomb to unlock their understanding. They believed the event before they fully understood the theology.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
απηλθον ουν πα προϲ αυτουϲ εαυτουϲ οι μαθηται

**English Translation**
Went away therefore again to themselves the disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They return *pros heautous* (to themselves/their own homes). They carry the seed of faith back into the mundane world. They leave the tomb, for the Living One is not there. It is a withdrawal to ponder the mystery before the full revelation of the Spirit.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
μαριαμ δε · ϊϲτηκει εν τω μνημιω εξω κλαιου · ωϲ ουν εκλαιεν · παρεκυψεν ειϲ το μνημιον ·

**English Translation**
But Mariam stood in the *mnemeion* outside weeping. As therefore she wept, she stooped into the *mnemeion*.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the men depart, the woman remains. Her love fixes her to the spot of her loss. The text says she stood *en to mnemeio exo* (in the tomb outside)—a paradox of location, being at the entrance yet outside the mystery. Her weeping (*klaiou*) bends her body; she stoops (*parekypsen*) just as the beloved disciple did, drawn by tears to look once more into the void.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και θε δυο αγγελουϲ κα εν λευκοιϲ · ενα προϲ τη κεφαλη · και ε προϲ τοιϲ ποϲ ποϲ · οπου εκειτο το ϲωμα του

**English Translation**
And she beholds two angels sitting in white [garments]; one at the head, and one at the feet, feet, where the body of [him] had lain.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A vision of the New Ark of the Covenant. As the Cherubim flanked the Mercy Seat, so these two angels flank the place where the Lord's body rested—the true Mercy Seat now empty. The scribe repeats *pos* (feet, feet), emphasizing the physical reality of the space. The text abbreviates "sitting" (*ka*) and "one" (*e*), rushing to the holy image. The place of death has become the Holy of Holies, inhabited by the servants of Light.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
λεγου αυτη εκεινοι · γυναι · τι κλαιειϲ · λεγει αυτοιϲ · οτι η τον μου κ(αι) ουκ οιδα που εθη αυτον ˙

**English Translation**
They say to her: Woman, why do you weep? She says to them: Because [they took] my [Lord] and I know not where [they] placed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the depth of her grief, which blinds her even to the angelic presence. The scribe’s abbreviation "η" (likely for *ēran*, "they took") and the truncated "τον μου κ(αι)" (my Lord and...) reflects the hurried, broken speech of one in distress. She does not weep for a doctrine, but for a body; her piety is bound to the physical presence of the Master. She confesses ignorance ("I know not"), which is the prelude to the revelation of knowledge.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπουϲα εϲτρα ειϲ τα οπιϲω κ(αι) θεωρει τον ε και ουκ ηδει οτι εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
Having said these things, she turned backward and beholds the [Jesus] and knew not that it is [he].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery of spiritual sight: she sees the form but misses the substance. The text reads "τον ε" (likely an abbreviation for *ton Iēsoun*), placing the Savior directly in her field of vision. Yet, she "knew not." It is possible to stand in the very presence of the Risen Word and yet, through the veil of tears and fleshly expectation, fail to discern His divinity. She turns "backward" (*eis ta opisō*), a physical motion that must soon become a spiritual conversion.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη · γυναι τι κλαιειϲ · τινα ζη · εκεινη δε δο οτι ο κηπου εϲτιν · λεγει αυ ˙ · ει ϲυ ει ο βα εβαϲταϲαϲ αυτον · ει μοι που εθη αυτον · καγω αυ αρω

**English Translation**
He says to her: Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing that it is the gardener, says to [him]: If thou... if thou bore him away, tell me where thou placed him, and I will take him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe preserves the stammering of her passion in the text "ει ο βα εβαϲταϲαϲ" (if thou... bore him). She mistakes the Creator of Eden for the keeper of the garden—a holy irony, for He is indeed the New Adam cultivating life from the tomb. Note her solitary courage: "I will take him" (*kagō auton arō*). She, a lone woman, offers to carry the weight of a grown man’s corpse. Love does not calculate possibility; it only seeks the Beloved.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη ο · μαρι · ϲτραφειϲα δε ε · λεγει αυτω ε ραββουνι · ο λεγεται διδαϲκα κ(αι) προϲεδραμεν αψαϲθαι αυτου

**English Translation**
The [Jesus] says to her: Mary. She, having turned, says to him [in Hebrew]: Rabbouni, which is called Teacher, and ran forward to touch him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Recognition comes not through the eye, but through the ear; the Sheep knows the Shepherd's voice. The manuscript here includes a vital physical detail often omitted in other codices: *kai prosedramen hapsasthai autou* ("and she ran forward to touch him"). This rush to physical contact explains the immediate prohibition in the following verse. It is the impulsive movement of earthly affection seeking to hold onto what is now becoming heavenly.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη ο μη μου απτου ου γαρ αναβεβη προϲ τον πατε · πορευου δε ουν δε προϲ τουϲ αδελφουϲ μου και ειπε αυτοιϲ · αναβαινω προϲ τ πατερα μου και πα · και μου · και ϋμων ·

**English Translation**
The [Jesus] says to her: Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go therefore to my brothers and say to them: I ascend to the Father of me and Fa[ther]... and of me... and of yours.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is rugged here, with abbreviations ("πατε," "πα") indicating the scribe's haste or the density of the theology. The Lord establishes a new hierarchy of relationship. He does not say "Our Father," uniting Himself and the disciples in one nature, but distinguishes "My Father" (by nature) from "Your Father" (by grace). The prohibition "Touch me not" (*mē mou haptou*) instructs the Church that we must no longer cling to Christ according to the flesh, but ascend with Him in heart.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ερχεται μαριαμʼ η μαγδαληνη αγγελ απαγγελλουϲα τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ · οτι εωρακα τον · και ταυτα ειπεν αυ ·

**English Translation**
Mariam the Magdalene comes [messeng-] announcing to the disciples: That I have seen the [Lord], and these things he said to [her].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe begins to write *angel...* before correcting to *apangellousa* (announcing). This slip is truth: she is indeed the *angelos*, the messenger to the Apostles. Her testimony is twofold: ocular ("I have seen") and auditory ("He said"). She becomes the first evangelist of the Resurrection, carrying the new law of life to those who sit in the shadow of fear.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ουϲηϲ ουν οψι τη ημερα εκει τη μια ϲαββατων · και των θυρων κε οπου ηϲαν οι μαθηται ϲυνηγμενοι δια τον φοβον τ τ ϊουδαιων · ηλθεν ο και εϲτη ειϲ το μεϲον και λεγει αυτοιϲ · ϊρη ϋμιν

**English Translation**
Therefore, it being late on that day, the first of the sabbaths, and the doors being [closed] where the disciples were gathered through the fear of the Jews, the [Jesus] came and stood in the midst and says to them: Peace to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The doors are "closed" (*kekleismenōn*, abbreviated *κε*), yet the Word enters. Material barriers cannot hinder the Resurrected Body, which is subtle and glorified. The first utterance of the Risen Lord to His gathered Church is *Irēnē* (Peace). He meets their "fear" (*phobon*) not with rebuke, but with the gift of tranquility, healing the wound of their abandonment.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και τουτο ειπων · εδιξεν ταϲ χιραϲ και την πλευ αυτοιϲ εχαρηϲ εχαρηϲ ουν οι μαθηται ϊ τον ·

**English Translation**
And having said this, he showed the hands and the [side] to them; therefore the disciples rejoiced [rejoiced] seeing the [Lord].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *echarēs* (rejoiced) twice, perhaps an error, yet historically apt: their joy was double, overwhelming their previous double sorrow of death and despair. He shows the wounds—the *cheiras* (hands) and *pleuran* (side)—proving that the Risen One is the Crucified One. The trophies of His passion become the marks of His identity. There is no Resurrection without the scars of the Cross.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν κ(αι) ειπεν ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ παλιν · ειρηνη · καθωϲ απε με ο πα · καγω πεμψω αποϲτελλω πεμπω ϋμαϲ ·

**English Translation**
He said therefore and said said therefore to them again: Peace; just as the Fa[ther] has [sent] me, I also will send send send you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript exhibits great turbulence here—"said said said" and "send send send" (*pempsō apostellō pempō*). The scribe wrestles with the magnitude of the Great Commission. The analogy is terrifying in its demand: as the Father sent the Son (into suffering, death, and glory), so the Son sends the disciples. It is not merely a mission of words, but of ontological participation in His sending. The stuttering text betrays the trembling awe of the apostolic charge.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και τουτο ει ενεφυϲηϲ ενεφυϲηϲ και λεγει αυτοιϲ · λαβετε π αγιον ·

**English Translation**
And having [said] this, he breathed breathed [on them] and says to them: Receive Holy [Spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the repetition "breathed breathed" (*enephysēsen*). This recalls Genesis, where God breathed into the clay of Adam. Here, on the eighth day (the new first day), Christ recreates humanity. He breathes the *Pneuma* (Spirit) into the Church. The life of the Church is the very breath of the Risen Christ; without this continuous insufflation, we are but dust.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
αν τινων αφηται ταϲ αμαρτιαϲ · αφε αφεωντται αφεωνται αυτοιϲ · ε δε αν τινων κρα κρατηται κεκρατην

**English Translation**
If of any you forgive the sins, they are forgi- forgiven forgiven to them; but if of any you re- retain, they have been retained.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The power of the Keys is granted immediately upon the gift of the Spirit. The text struggles with the passive forms of forgiveness (*apheōntai*), showing the difficulty of expressing this divine passive: it is God who forgives through the human agent. The authority is binary: to release or to hold fast (*kratētai*). This judicial power is not for the disciples' glory, but for the administration of the peace He just bestowed.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
θωμαϲ δε · ειϲ εκ των δωδεκα ο λεγομενοϲ διδυ · ουκ ην με αυτων οτε ουν ηλ ˙

**English Translation**
But Thomas, one of the twelve, the one called Twin, was not with them when therefore [he] came.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Thomas is called *Didymus* (Twin). He represents the duality of the human heart—faith and doubt entwined. His absence from the *synaxis* (the gathering) is the cause of his unbelief. The Lord came "when therefore he came" (the text is abrupt), but Thomas was not there. To separate oneself from the community of the brethren is to miss the appearing of the Lord. Faith is found within the gathered body, not in isolation.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ελεγον ουν αυτ οι αλλοι μαθηται · ε τον · ο δε ειπεν αυ · εαν μη ειδω εν ταιϲ χερϲιν τ αυτον αυτου τον τυπον των ηλ ηλ · και βαλω μου τον δακτυλον ειϲ την χειραν αυτου τον τυπον των ηλων τον τυπον των ηλων και βαλω μου την χει ειϲ την πλευρ αυτου · ου μη πιϲτευ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore said to hi[m] the other disciples: [We have seen] the [Lord]; but he said to the[m]: If I do not see in the hands o[f] him of him the mark of the nails nails; and put my finger into the hand of him the mark of the nails the mark of the nails and put my ha[nd] into the sid[e] of him; no not will I belie[ve].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the turmoil in the text, reflecting the turmoil in the soul of the Twin. The scribe here stammers, repeating *ton typon ton helon* (the mark of the nails) multiple times, and writing "of him" twice (*auton autou*). Is this mere error, or does the Spirit allow the parchment to mirror Thomas’s frantic insistence? Thomas demands a tactile encounter with the trauma of the Passion. He requires the *typon*—the impression or blow—of the nails. He does not ask for the glory of the Resurrection, but the wounds of the Crucifixion. It is a stubborn faith that refuses to bypass the Cross to reach the Crown. The double negative *ou me* (no not) seals his obstinacy: without the wound, there is no witness.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και μεθ ημε οκτω · παλιν ηϲαν εϲω οι μα · και θωμαϲ μετ αυτων · ερχεται ο των θυρων κεκλιϲμε · και εϲτη ειϲ το μεϲον και ει · ϊρηνη ϋμιν ·

**English Translation**
And after days eight; again were inside the dis[ciples]; and Thomas with them; comes the [Jesus] the doors being shut; and stood in the midst and sa[id]; Peace to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "eighth day" signifies the new creation, the Sunday of the Lord, returning us to the rhythm of the gathered assembly. Though the doors are *keklismen* (shut fast) against the fear of the Jews, the Logos is not bound by wood or stone. He enters not by breaking the lock, but by virtue of a body that is real yet glorified, subtle yet solid. He stands *eis to meson*—in the very center—displacing their fear with His presence. His first word is the remedy for their terror: *Irene* (Peace). He does not rebuke Thomas for his absence previously, but includes him in the collective blessing of peace.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ειτα λεγει τω θω · φερε τον δα ϲου ωδε · και ϊδε ταϲ χειραϲ μου · και φερε την χειρα ϲου · και βαλε ειϲ την πλευραν μου · και μη γινου απιϲτοϲ αλλα πιϲτοϲ ·

**English Translation**
Then he says to Tho[mas]; Bring the fin[ger] of you here; and see the hands of me; and bring the hand of you; and put into the side of me; and be not unbelieving but believing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the humility of God! He submits Himself to the examination of a skeptical servant. He repeats Thomas’s own conditions from verse 25 back to him, showing that He heard the doubts whispered in secret. The command is visceral: *bale* (throw/thrust) your hand into the side. This is the open fountain of the Church, the side from which blood and water flowed. The Lord commands a change of state, an ontological shift from *apistos* (faithless) to *pistos* (faithful). He does not merely ask for intellectual assent, but for a transformation of being.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο θω και ειπεν αυ ˙ ο μου και ο μου

**English Translation**
Answered Tho[mas] and said to hi[m]: The [Lord] of me and the [God] of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is stark, abbreviated to the breaking point: *Ho mou kai ho mou* (The of me and the of me). The scribe assumes we know the Titles so well they need not be written fully. It is the cry of total possession and total submission. Thomas moves from the lowest skepticism to the highest theology in a single breath. He acknowledges Jesus not merely as a teacher, but as the Divine Reality itself. The double article (*ho*) points to the distinct reality of Lordship and Divinity, yet united in the one Person standing before him. It is the first time in the Gospel a disciple speaks with such naked dogmatic clarity to the face of the Risen One.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν λεγι δε αυτω ο · οτι εωρα με και πεπι · μακαρι οι μη ϊδοντεϲ με και πιϲτευϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Said says but to him the [Jesus]; Because you have se[en] me and have beli[eved]; blessed the ones not seeing me and believ[ing].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe falters between tenses—*eipen legi* (said says)—capturing the timeless nature of this beatitude. The Lord accepts Thomas's faith but pronounces a greater blessing upon the Church to come. We, who read this Codex, are the beneficiaries of this *makarioi* (blessed ones). Faith that relies on sight is valid, but faith that relies on the Word and the Spirit without ocular proof is more robust. It is the commendation of the invisible struggle of the soul that trusts in the testimony of the Apostles rather than the demand of the eyes.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
πολλα μεν ουν και αλλα ϲη εποιηϲεν ο · ενωπιον τ τ μαθητων αυτου · α ουκ εϲτιν γεγραμ εν τω βιβλι τουτω ·

**English Translation**
Many indeed therefore and other si[gns] did the [Jesus]; before the the disciples of him; which is not writ[ten] in the book this.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist admits the limitation of his medium. Ink and parchment (*biblio touto*) cannot contain the infinite acts of the Incarnate Word. The *semeia* (signs) mentioned are but a curated selection, chosen not for history's sake, but for theology's sake. The repetition of the article *t t* (the the) before disciples emphasizes that these signs were verified by witnesses; they were not done in a corner. The silence of the unwritten deeds speaks as loudly as the written ones, inviting us to marvel at the vastness of Christ's ministry.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα δε γεγραπται · ϊνα πιϲτευητε πιϲτευϲητε · οτι εϲτιν ο · ο του κ(αι) ϊνα πιϲτευον · ζωην αιωνι εχητε εν τω ονοματι αυτου ·

**English Translation**
But these are written; in order that you might believe [you might come to believe]; that is the [Christ]; the [Son] of the [God] and in order that believ[ing]; life etern[al] you might have in the name of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the *skopos*, the aim of the entire Gospel. The scribe preserves a correction: *pisteuete pisteusete*—moving between the present subjunctive (continue believing) and the aorist subjunctive (come to believe). Both are true: the text is for the conversion of the heathen and the strengthening of the faithful. The content of the faith is specific: Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God. The result of this faith is not merely knowledge, but *zoen aionion* (eternal life). This life is found nowhere else but *en to onomati autou* (in His name). The book closes this chapter not with a period, but with a promise of vitality for all who grasp the Name.
