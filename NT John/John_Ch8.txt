**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
παλ παλ ουν αυτοιϲ ελαλη ο λεγων · ε φωϲ ειμι ειμι το φωϲ ειμι το φωϲ του κοϲμου ο ακολου εμοι · ου μη περιπατηϲη εν τη ϲκοτια αλλ εχει εξει το φωϲ τηϲ ζωηϲ ·

**English Translation**
Again again therefore to them spoke the [One] saying: I light am am the light am the light of the world; the [one] following me, by no means shall walk in the darkness, but has—will have—the light of life.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the urgency in the scribe’s hand, repeating *palin palin* ("again again") and the threefold declaration of *eimi to phos* ("am the light"). It is as if the parchment itself stammers under the blinding radiance of the Lord’s revelation. The text reads *e phos*—a truncation of *ego*—suggesting the "I" is consumed by the "Light." Furthermore, notice the correction *echei hexei* ("has will have"). The scribe wavers between present possession and future inheritance. We affirm both: the follower possesses the Light now by grace, yet shall possess it fully in the Kingdom.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ουν αυτω · οι φαριϲαιοι · ϲυ πε ϲεαυτου μαρτυ · η μαρτυρια ϲου ουκ εϲτιν αληθηϲ ·

**English Translation**
Said therefore to him the Pharisees: You concerning yourself testify; the testimony of you is not true.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The adversaries speak in abbreviated legalisms. *Sy pe seautou marty* ("You concerning yourself testify"). They truncate the living Word into a juridical problem. They look upon the Sun and demand it prove it is shining by the testimony of a lamp. Their accusation that His witness "is not true" (*ouk estin alethes*) reveals their spiritual blindness; they judge the Creator by the statutes of the creature.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο · καν εγω μαρτυρω περι εμαυτου · αλη εϲτιν η μαρ μου · οτι οι ποθεν ηλθον · και που ϋπαγω · ϋ ουκ οιδαται ποθεν ερχομαι και που ·

**English Translation**
Said to them the [One]: Even if I testify concerning myself, true is the testimony of me; because I know from where I came and where I go; [but] you do not know from where I come and where [I go].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Nomina Sacra for Jesus is absent here, represented only by the article *o* ("the [One]"), emphasizing His distinctness. The Lord asserts the authority of origin and destiny. He uses *oida* ("I know"), contrasting sharply with the Pharisees' ignorance (*ouk oidate*). The text abbreviates the final clause simply as *kai pou* ("and where"), leaving the destination unspoken, for the carnal mind cannot comprehend the bosom of the Father to which the Son returns.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ϋ κατα την ϲαρ κρινετε · εγω ου κρινω ουδε ·

**English Translation**
You according to the flesh judge; I do not judge no one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A stark antithesis. The scribe abbreviates *sarka* to *sar*, stripping the flesh down to its barest element. The Lord’s statement *ou krino oudena* ("I judge no one") must be understood dispensationally; He came first to save, not to condemn. The flesh (*sar*) can only measure by appearance; the Spirit discerns the heart. You, O Pharisees, are trapped in the limitations of your own abbreviated nature.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
καν κρινω δε εγω · η κριϲιϲ η ε αληθηϲ εϲτ εϲτ . οτι μονοϲ ουκ ει · αλλ εγω και ο πεμψαϲ με

**English Translation**
And if judge but I, the judgment the [mine] true is is; because alone not I am, but I and the [one] having sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The dittography *estin estin* ("is is") functions almost as a divine affirmation—"it is, and it is." The judgment is true because it is not solitary. The scribe writes *ouk ei* ("not I am" [alone]), preserving the unity of operation between Father and Son. The Father is the sender, the Son is the sent, yet in judgment, they are one motion of Truth.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και τω νομω δε τω ϋμετερω γεγραμ εϲτιν · οτι δυο ανθρωπων η μαρτυρια αλη εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
And in the law moreover the yours it has been written, that of two men the testimony true is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the distancing phrase: *to nomo to hymetero* ("the law the yours"). He does not say "God's law," but "yours," for they have made it a possession rather than a revelation. The scribe abbreviates *gegrammenon* to *gegram*, as if the very writing of the law is secondary to the Living Word standing before them. He condescends to their requirement for two witnesses, though He is Truth itself.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
εγω ει ο μαρτυρων περι εμαυτου · και μαρτυρει περι εμου ο πεμψαϲ με πατηρ ·

**English Translation**
I am the [one] testifying concerning myself, and testifies concerning me the [one] having sent me Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the dual witness. *Ego eimi* ("I am") stands at the forefront. He is the Subject and the Object of the testimony. The Father is the second witness, yet He is invisible to the accusers. The text flows without abbreviation here, granting full dignity to the relationship between the *pempas* (Sender) and the *martyron* (Witness).

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ελεγ ελεγ ουν αυτω · που ε ο πατηρ ϲου · απεκριθη ο και ειπεν · ουτε εμε οιδαται · ουτε τ πατερα μου · ει ε ηδειται · και τ πατερα ηδειται αν :

**English Translation**
Said said therefore to him: Where is the Father of you? Answered the [One] and said: Neither me do you know, nor the Father of me; if me you knew, also the Father you would know.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribal stutter *elegon elegon* ("said said") captures the persistent, nagging unbelief of the crowd. They ask "Where?" (*pou*), seeking a physical location for a spiritual reality. The Lord’s rebuke is total: ignorance of the Son necessitates ignorance of the Father. The phonetic spelling *edeite* (for *eideite*) betrays the common tongue, yet the theology is high: The Son is the only exegesis of the Father.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα τα ρηματα ε εν τω γαζοφυλακιω · και ουδιϲ επιαϲ επιαϲ αυτον οτι ουπω εληλυθει η ωρα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
These the words [he spoke] in the treasury; and no one seized seized him, because not yet had come the hour of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In the *gazophylakio* (treasury), amidst the gold of the temple, the true Gold speaks. The verb *elalesen* is cut short to *e*, as if the act of speaking is overshadowed by the content. The repetition *epiasen epiasen* ("seized seized") emphasizes the intensity of their desire to arrest Him, or perhaps the repeated futile attempts. But the "hour" (*hora*) serves as a divine shield. Man's will to violence is impotent against God's timeline.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν ο ο αυτοιϲ · εγω ϋπα και ζητηϲετε ζητηϲεται με · και εν τη αμαρ ϋμων αποθα · οπου εγω ϋπαγω · ου δυ ελθιν ·

**English Translation**
Said the the [One] to them: I go and you will seek you will seek me; and in the sin of you [you will die]; where I go, not [you are able] to come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying verse, heavily marked by the scribe’s trembling hand. *O o* ("the the") repeats the article for the unnamed Lord. *Zetesete zetesetai* shows a confusion of spelling, doubling the futile seeking of the damned. Most chilling is the truncation *apotha*—the word "die" is cut off, just as their lives will be cut off in sin (*hamar*). The inability to follow (*ou dy[nasthe] elthin*) seals the separation between the earthly minded and the heavenly Lord.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ε ουν οι · μητι απο εαυτον . ο λεγει οπου αν εγω ϋπαγω ϋμιϲ ου δυναϲθαι ελθ ελθ

**English Translation**
[Said] therefore the [Jews]: surely not [kill] himself? Because he says: Where [if] I go you not are able to come to come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is fractured here. *E* for "said," *oi* for "the Jews," and *apo* for "kill" (apoktenei). The scribe recoils from writing the full blasphemy of their suggestion that the Lord would commit suicide. Their misunderstanding is profound. They mock His departure, unaware that His "going" is a sacrificial death for the life of the world, not a despairing exit *apo heauton* ("from himself"). The repetition *elth elth* ("to come to come") echoes the impossibility of their transit to His glory.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν ουν κ(αι) ελεγεν ελεγεν ουν αυτοιϲ · ϋμειϲ εκ των κα εϲτε · εγω εκ τ τ ανω ειμι · εκ του κοϲμου του εϲτε · εγω ουκ ει εκ του κοϲμου τουτου ˙

**English Translation**
Said therefore and said said therefore to them: You from the [realms] below are; I from the the above am; [you] from the world [this] are; I not am from the world this.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chaotic opening—*elegen oun kai elegen elegen oun* ("said therefore and said said therefore")—marks a crescendo of divine confrontation. The scribe piles verb upon verb to introduce the Great Divide. *Ek ton ka* (from the below) vs. *ek t t ano* (from the the above). The dualism is absolute. The scribe omits *toutou* ("this") in the first clause but includes it at the end, emphasizing that *this* specific world system is the source of their blindness. Christ is *ouk ei* (not am) of it. He is the alien intrusion of Truth into the realm of the Lie.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ϋμ ϋμ · οτι αποθανιϲθαι εν ταιϲ αμαρτιαιϲ ϋμων · εαν γαρ μη πιϲτευϲηται μοι οτι εγω ειμι · απο εν ταιϲ αμαρτιαιϲ ·

**English Translation**
I said to you [to you], that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe me that I am, [you will die] in the sins.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the grave repetition of the warning, inscribed twice upon the parchment as if to strike the heart with double force: "to you, to you." The Lord links mortality not merely to the corruption of the flesh, but to the adherence to sin. The pivotal condition for escape is the recognition of the Divine Name, "I am" (*Ego eimi*). By refusing to acknowledge this existence—which is the very Being of God derived from the burning bush—the soul remains anchored in death. The text concludes abruptly with "in the sins," leaving the consequence hanging over the listener like a sword.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ελεγον αυτω ϲυ τιϲ ει · ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ ο · την αρ ο τι και εν λα ϋμιν

**English Translation**
They were saying to him, "Who are you?" Therefore [He] said to them, "The begin[ning] that what also in... [speak] to you."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation "Who are you?" betrays the blindness of the flesh. The Lord’s reply in this codex is mysterious and fragmented (`την αρ`), pointing to *tēn archēn*—the Beginning. He is the Arche, the Origin, identifying Himself with the very genesis of things. Even though the scribe’s hand struggles (`εν λα`), the sense remains: He is that which He speaks. His being and His utterance are one; He does not merely possess the truth, He is the Primordial Word addressing them.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
πολλα εχω περι ϋμων λαλιν και κρινιν · αλλ ο πεμψαϲ με πατηρʼ αληθηϲ ε · καγω α ηκου παρ αυτω αυτου · ταυ λαλω ειϲ τον κοϲμον ·

**English Translation**
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you; but the Father who sent me is true; and I, what things I heard from him [of him], these things I speak into the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Son establishes the hierarchy of His mission. He possesses the authority to judge (`κρινιν`), yet He defers to the Sender. The insertion of `πατηρʼ` (Father) explicitly identifies the Sender, reinforcing the consubstantial bond. The Lord acts as the perfect vessel of the Father’s voice; there is no deviation between what is heard in heaven (`ηκου`) and what is spoken into the cosmos (`κοϲμον`). The repetition `παρ αυτω αυτου` emphasizes the intimacy of this hearing—He hears from Him, of Him.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ουκ εγνω οτι τον πατε αυτοιϲ ελεγεν τον

**English Translation**
They did not know that he was speaking to them [of] the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A lamentable ignorance (`ουκ εγνω`). Despite the explicit mention of the Sender, the veil over their hearts remains thick. The text abbreviates "Father" (`πατε`), perhaps reflecting the haste of the scribe or the mystery of the name. They hear the sound of the words but fail to perceive the Divine Person behind them. It teaches us that without the illumination of the Spirit, theological discourse is but noise to the carnal ear.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ ο παλιν οταν ϋψωϲητε τον του ανθρωπου · τοτε γνωϲεϲθαι οτι εγω ειμι · και απ εμαυτου ποι ουδεν · αλλα κα εδιδαξεν με ο πατηρʼ · ουτωϲ λα ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [He] said to them again, "When you lift up the [Son] of Man, then you will know that I am; and from myself I do nothing; but as the Father taught me, thus I speak."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "lifting up" (`ϋψωϲητε`) is the great paradox of our faith: the exaltation upon the Cross. Only through the scandal of the Passion is the "I am" fully revealed. The text omits "Son" (`υιον`), reading simply "the of the Man," focusing intensely on His humanity which suffers. Yet, in this suffering, He does nothing (`ποι ουδεν`) of His own separate will; His actions and speech (`λα`) are a direct mirroring of the Father’s instruction. The Cross is the ultimate lesson taught by the Father and spoken by the Son.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και ο πεμψαϲ με ουκ αφηκε με μονον μετ εμου εϲτιν μετ εμου εϲτιν ουκ αφηκεν με μονον οτι εγω τα αρεϲτα αυτω ποι παντοτε ·

**English Translation**
And the one who sent me did not leave me alone; he is with me, he is with me; he did not leave me alone; because I do always the things pleasing to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the emphatic assurance of the Divine Presence! The scribe repeats `μετ εμου εϲτιν` ("he is with me") twice, as if the Lord is shouting this comfort against the coming desolation of the crucifixion. He is never solitary, for the union of the Trinity cannot be severed. The ground of this abiding presence is the Son’s perfect obedience—He does (`ποι`) always what pleases the Father. Our own communion with God depends similarly on doing what is pleasing to Him.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα αυτου λαλουντοϲ πολλοι επιϲτευϲ επιϲτευϲ ειϲ αυτον

**English Translation**
As he was speaking these things, many believed, believed in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The power of the Word is instantaneous. Even as He speaks of the Cross and judgment, faith is kindled. The manuscript stutters with joy, repeating `επιϲτευϲ` ("believed"), mirroring the multitude of souls turning toward the Light. It is not miracles here that compel them, but the authority of His speech concerning the Father.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν ουν ο προϲ τουϲ πεπιϲτευκο αυτω ϊουδαι · εαν ϋμιϲ μι εν τω λογω τω εμω · αληθωϲ μαθηται μου μου εϲτε ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [He] was saying to the Jews having believed him, "If you abide in my word, truly you are my, my disciples."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Belief is the beginning, but endurance is the proof. The Lord addresses those who have just believed (`πεπιϲτευκο`), warning them that discipleship requires abiding (`μι` for *meinēte*). One must dwell within the Logos. The double possessive `μου μου` ("my, my disciples") in the text suggests a deep, jealous claiming of these souls by Christ. They belong to Him, provided they do not depart from the enclosure of His teaching.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) γνωϲεϲθαι την αληθειαν · και η αληθια ελευθερω ϋμαϲ ·

**English Translation**
And you will know the truth, and the truth will free you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the promise of the intellectual and spiritual life. Knowledge (`γνωϲεϲθαι`) is not abstract speculation but an encounter with the Truth, which is Christ Himself. This Truth is the agent of liberation (`ελευθερω`). It breaks the chains of error and the bondage of the passions. Freedom is not the license to sin, but the power to see God as He is, unencumbered by the lies of the enemy.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
απεκρι προϲ αυτον · ϲπερμα αβρααμʼ ε · και ουδενι δεδουλευκαμεν πωποτε · πωϲ ϲυ λεγειϲ οτι ελευθε γενηϲεϲθε ·

**English Translation**
They answered him, "We are seed of Abraham, and to no one have we been enslaved ever; how do you say that you will become free?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pride blinds the memory. They claim to be Abraham's seed (`ϲπερμα αβρααμʼ`) and assert they have never been enslaved (`δεδουλευκαμεν`), conveniently forgetting Egypt, Babylon, and the Roman eagle currently looming over them. But the Lord speaks of a deeper slavery. Their reliance on fleshly lineage ("we are," `ε`) prevents them from recognizing their spiritual captivity. They are offended by the offer of freedom because they refuse to admit their chains.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτοιϲ ο · αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν · οτι παϲ ο ποιων την αμαρ δουλοϲ εϲτ εϲτ τηϲ αμαρτιαϲ ·

**English Translation**
[He] answered them, "Amen, amen I say to you, that everyone doing the sin is, is a slave of the sin."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verdict is rendered with the double "Amen." The Lord defines slavery not by political status but by moral action. "Doing the sin" (`ποιων την αμαρ`) constitutes the servitude. The repetition `εϲτ εϲτ` ("is, is") solidifies the ontology of the sinner: he *is* essentially a slave. He has lost his autonomy and serves a cruel master who pays wages only in death.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ο δε δουλοϲ ου μενει εν τη οικια ειϲ τον αιωνα ·

**English Translation**
Now the slave does not remain in the house forever.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A warning of eviction. The slave has no permanent right to the household (`οικια`). The Jews, resting on their lineage, believed the house of God was theirs by right. But Christ declares that the status of a slave—one who commits sin—is transient. Only the Son remains forever. To stay in the house, one must transition from the slavery of sin to the sonship of grace, a transformation only possible through the Son who abides eternally.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
εαν ουν ο ϋμαϲ ελευθε ελευθερωϲη ελευθερωϲη οντωϲ ελευ εϲεϲθαι εϲεϲται εϲεϲθαι ·

**English Translation**
If therefore the [Son] you free shall free shall free, indeed free ye shall be ye shall be ye shall be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the trembling hand of the scribe! Three times he writes "shall free" (*eleutherōsē*) and three times "ye shall be" (*esesthai/esestai*), as if the ink itself stammers with the magnitude of this liberty. The text here is a ecstatic rupture. We do not correct this abundance; we preach it. The freedom granted by the Son is not a singular act but a threefold confirmation—truly free in body, truly free in soul, truly free in spirit. The repetition of "ye shall be" seals the promise against all doubt; it is an ontological change in the believer, echoed into eternity.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
οι οτι ϲπερμα αβρα εϲτε · αλλα ζητει με αποκτιναι · οτι ο λογοϲ ο εμοϲ ου χωρει εν ϋμ ϋμ ·

**English Translation**
[I] know that seed of Abra[am] ye are; but ye seek me to kill; because the word the mine not have place in you you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord admits their carnal lineage—they are the seed of Abraham—but denies their spiritual kinship. The scribe abbreviates "Abraham" to *Abra*, perhaps hastening to the tragedy of the verse: they seek to kill the Life. Note the doubling of *hymin* (in you you) at the close. The Word (*Logos*) finds no room in them because they are full of themselves, doubled in their own ego and obstinacy. Where the self is repeated, the Logos is displaced.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
α εγω εωρακα πα τω πατρι μου λα · και ϋμιϲ ουν α ε ο ηκουϲαται ο ηκουϲαται παρα του πατροϲ ϋμων ποι ·

**English Translation**
What things I have seen with the Father of me [I] speak; and ye therefore what... that which ye heard that which ye heard from the father of you [ye] do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A stark division of origins. The Lord speaks (*la* for *lalō*) from vision; He has "seen" with the Father. The Jews act from hearing, and hearing from a different father. The manuscript stumbles here—*a e o*—confusion in the relative pronouns, followed by a repetition of "ye heard." This textual chaos mirrors the confusion of the adversaries. They hear noises, echoes of a dark paternity, and they mimic (*poi* for *poieite*) these distortions. We see here the liturgy of heaven (seeing and speaking) versus the cacophony of hell (hearing rumors and acting).

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲ απεκριθηϲ και ειπαν αυτω ˙ ο πατηρʼ ημων αβρα εϲτιν · απεκρι αυτοιϲ ο ει τε του αβρααμʼ ε · τα εργα του αβρα εποιειται αν αν ·

**English Translation**
Answered answered and said to him: The father of us Abra[am] is. Answered them the [Jesus]: If children of the Abraam [ye] are, the works of the Abra[am] ye would do [would].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats "Answered" (*apekrithēs*), emphasizing the defensiveness of the Jews. They cling to the name *Abra* as a talisman. The Lord’s reply is sharp. The text reads *o* (The [Jesus]) and *e* (are) and *an* (would/if). The logic is devastating: Sonship is defined by *praxis*, not lineage. If the nature of the root is holy, the branches must bear holy fruit. The trailing *an αν* suggests an unfulfilled condition—"ye would do them... [but ye do not]."

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
νυν δε ζητιτε με απο · ανθρωπ · οϲʼ την αληθιαν ϋ λελαληκα · ηκουϲα παρα του · τουτο αβρααμʼ ουκ εποιηϲεν ·

**English Translation**
But now ye seek me to kill; [a] man who the truth to you hath spoken; [which I] heard from the [God]; this Abraam did not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of the Hypostatic Union recorded in ink. He calls Himself *anthrōp* (man), fully participating in our nature, yet the source of His speech is *para tou*—from the [God]. The scribe uses the article *tou* as a Nomina Sacra, implying the Divine Name without writing it. Abraham did not kill the messengers of God; he welcomed them under the oaks of Mamre. To kill the Truth-teller is to unmake one's own ancestry.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ϋ δε δε ποιειται τα εργα του πατροϲ ϋμ · ειπαν αυτω ημιϲ εκ πορνιαϲ ουκ εγεν ου γεγεννημεθα ˙ ενα πατε εχομεν τον ·

**English Translation**
Ye [but] but do the works of the father of you. They said to him: We from fornication not were... not were born; one father we have, the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The adversaries stutter in their indignation (*de de*—but but). They perceive the accusation of illegitimacy. The scribe writes *ouk egen* then corrects to *ou gegennēmetha* (not born), capturing the flustered denial of the Jews. They claim *ton* (The [God]) as Father. It is the perennial heresy: claiming the High God while rejecting His Anointed. They appeal to monotheism ("one father") to justify deicide.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ ο · ει ο πατηρ η ην · ηγαπατε εμε εγω γαρ εκ του εξηλθον και η · ουδε γαρ απ ε εληλυθα · αλλ εκεινοϲ με απεϲτιλεν ·

**English Translation**
Said therefore to them the [Jesus]: If the father [God] was, ye would love me; for I from the [God] came forth and am [here]; for neither from myself have I come, but that one me sent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is compressed, holy shorthand. *O* stands for Jesus; *H* stands for *Theos* (God) in the conditional clause. If God were your Father, love would be the natural instinct, for Like loves Like. He says "I came forth" (*exēlthon*—eternal generation) and "am here" (*hē*—incarnational presence). He disavows self-origin (*ap e*—from myself); He is the Sent One. To reject the Sent is to despise the Sender.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
διατι την λαλιαν την ε ου γινωϲκε · οτι ου δυναϲθε ακουειν τον λογ τον εμον ·

**English Translation**
Why the speech the mine [do ye] not know? Because ye are not able to hear the word the mine.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A distinction is drawn between *lalian* (speech/dialect) and *logon* (word/substance). They cannot understand the idiom of Heaven because their ears are tuned to the frequency of the earth. The scribe abbreviates "mine" (*e* for *emēn*), rushing to the verdict: incapacity. It is not that they *will* not hear, but that they *cannot* (*ou dynasthe*). The organ of spiritual hearing has atrophied through sin.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ εκ του πατροϲ του δι εϲται · και ταϲ επιθυμιαϲ του π θελετε ποιειν ˙ εκινοϲ αν απ αρχηϲ · και εν τη αληθια ουκ εϲτη · οτι ουκ εϲτ αληθια εν αυτω ο λαλη το ψευδοϲ · εκ των ϊδιων λα · οτι ψευϲτηϲ εϲτιν και ο πατηρ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Ye from the father the dev[il] are; and the lusts of the f[ather] ye will to do. That one [a] murd[erer] [was] from beginning; and in the truth stood not; because not is truth in him; [when] he speaketh the lie, from the own [he] speak[eth]; because a liar he is and the father of it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex is terrified to name the Evil One. *Di* stands for *Diabolou*; *P* for *Patros*; *An* for *Anthropoktonos* (man-killer). The text shrinks from the full spelling of the demonic. He is the "man-killer" from the beginning. Why? Because he stripped Adam of immortality. He stands not in truth. When he speaks, he speaks *ek tōn idiōn*—from his own resources, for he has no divine source. He is the father of the lie; solitary, self-referential, and barren of reality.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
εγω δε οτι την αληθιαν λεγω ου πιϲτευετε μοι ·

**English Translation**
I but because the truth I speak, ye believe me not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the tragic paradox of the fallen mind. If He spoke falsehoods that flattered their pride, they would embrace Him. But because (*oti*) He speaks the unvarnished Truth, they reject Him. Truth has become the very cause of disbelief. The light pains the diseased eye; the Truth offends the deceitful heart.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
τιϲ εξ υμων ελεγ με περι αμαρ · ει αληθιαν λε · διατι ϋμειϲ ου πιϲτευεται μοι ·

**English Translation**
Who of you convict[s] me concerning sin? If truth [I] sp[eak], why do ye not believe me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Sinless One issues a challenge. *Eleg* (convicts) and *amar* (sin) are abbreviated, as if the concept of sin attaching to Christ is too absurd to write fully. He appeals to reason: if He is sinless, He is trustworthy. If He speaks truth, disbelief is irrational. The spelling *pisteuetai* (ye believe) uses the diphthong *ai*, a common phonetic drift, yet the question remains sharp: Unbelief is not an intellectual problem, but a moral refusal.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ο ων εκ του · τα ρηματα του ακου · δια τουτο ϋμειϲ ουκ ακουετε οτι εκ του ουκ εϲτε ·

**English Translation**
He being of the [God], the words of the [God] hear[eth]; therefore ye hear not, because of the [God] ye are not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The capstone of the argument. The scribe uses *tou* (of the) twice to signify God without writing the Name. To be "of the God" (*ek tou*) is to possess a nature resonant with His voice. The ear is the test of the soul. You do not hear, not because the voice is faint, but because your origin is alien. You are not *ek tou*. The chapter closes on this terrifying diagnosis of estrangement.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲαν οι ϊουδαιοι και ειπ αυτω · ου καλωϲ λεγο ημειϲ · οτι ϲα ει ϲυ · και δαι εχειϲ ·

**English Translation**
The Jews answered and said to him: Do we not say well, that you are a Sa[maritan], and have a dem[on]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the adversaries of Truth abandon argument for abuse. By calling the Lord a "Samaritan" (`ϲα`), they brand Him a heretic and a stranger to the Covenant; by accusing Him of having a "demon" (`δαι`), they attribute His divine works to the adversary. Observe the pride in their error: "Do we not say well?" They claim virtue in their blasphemy, believing their rejection of God's Son is a defense of God's honor.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
α και ει · εγω δαιμο ουκ εχω · αλλα τιμω τον πα μου · και ατιμαζετε με ·

**English Translation**
J[esus] answered and said: I have not a demo[n]; but I honor my Fa[ther], and you dishonor me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord displays divine meekness. He passes over the slur of "Samaritan" in silence but vigorously refutes the charge of the demon (`δαιμο`), for a demon opposes God, whereas the Son honors the Father (`πα`). The logic is unbreakable: because He honors the Father, their dishonoring of Him is, in reality, a dishonoring of the Father. There is no middle ground; to insult the Begotten is to insult the Begetter.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
ε δε ου ζητω τ τ δοξαν μου · εϲτ εϲτ ο ζητων και κριν κριν ·

**English Translation**
But I seek not my glory; there is [one] seeking and judging.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ empties Himself of ambition. He does not hunt for human praise (`δοξαν`). The text here stammers with repetition (`εϲτ εϲτ`, `κριν κριν`), as if the scribe trembled at the weight of the statement. There is One—the Father—who seeks the glory of the Son and judges those who withhold it. The Son rests in the Father's vindication.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν · εαν τιϲ τον εμον λογον τηρη θανατον ου μη θεωρηϲει ειϲ τον αιωνα ˙

**English Translation**
Amen amen I say to you: if anyone keeps my word, death he shall never see into the age.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sovereign promise of immortality. The condition is keeping the *logos* (word/doctrine). The reward is that the believer shall not "see" (`θεωρηϲει`) death—meaning spiritual death or the terror of final separation—"into the age" (eternity). The body may sleep, but the soul united to the Word cannot die.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
ειπ ειπ αυτω οι ϊουδαιοι · νυν εγνωκαμ εγνωκαμ οτι δαιμονιον εχειϲ · αβρααμʼ α και οι προφηται και ϲυ λεγειϲ εαν τιϲ τ τ λογον μου τηρη · ου μη γευϲηται θανατου ειϲ τον αιωνα ·

**English Translation**
The Jews said to him: Now we have known that you have a demon; Abraham d[ied] and the prophets, and you say if anyone keeps my word, he shall never taste of death into the age.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The carnal mind cannot comprehend spiritual life. They point to the tombs of the patriarchs (`αβρααμʼ α` - Abraham died) as proof against Jesus. They distort His words, changing "see death" to "taste of death" (`γευϲηται`). They argue from the mortality of the servants (prophets) to deny the power of the Master.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
μη ϲυ μιζων ει του πατροϲ ημων α · οϲτιϲ απε και οι προ απεθαν απεθαν · τινα ϲεαυτον ποιειϲ ·

**English Translation**
Are you greater than our father A[braham], who d[ied]? And the pro[phets] died. Whom do you make yourself?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the central interrogation of the faith. "Whom do you make yourself?" They believe He is fabricating an identity (`ποιειϲ` - making/doing), whereas He simply *is*. They anchor their hope in the dead (`απεθαν`), while the Source of Life stands before them. They ask if He is "greater," unaware that Abraham was but a shadow of Him.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο εαν εγω δοξαϲω δοξαζω δοξαϲω εμαυ · η δοξα μου ου εϲτιν · εϲτιν ο πατηρʼ μου ο δο με · ον υ λεγεται · οτι ϋμων εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
J[esus] answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is noth[ing]; it is my Father who glo[rifies] me; of whom y[ou] say that he is yours.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He rejects self-appointed glory. True glory comes only from the Father (`πατηρ`). He exposes their hypocrisy: they claim the Father as "theirs" (`ϋμων εϲτιν`), yet they reject the very One the Father is glorifying (`δο`). If they truly knew the Father, they would recognize His action in the Son.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
και ουκ εγνωκα αυτον · εγω δε οιδα αυτον · καν ειπω οτι ουκ οι αυτον εϲομαι ομοιοϲ ϋμων ψευ · αλλ οιδα αυτ αυτ · και τον λογον αυ τηρω ·

**English Translation**
And [you] have not known him; but I know him. And if I say that I know him not, I shall be like you, a liar; but I know hi[m], and keep h[is] word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sharp distinction between their ignorance and His innate knowledge (`οιδα`). For Christ to deny His knowledge of the Father would be a lie (`ψευ`), making Him like them. His holiness is bound to His truthfulness. He proves His knowledge by obedience: He "keeps his word," unlike the disobedient sons of the law.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
αβρααμʼ ο π υμων ηγαλ ειδη την ημεραν την εμην · και ειδεν κ(αι) εχαρη ·

**English Translation**
Abraham your f[ather] exulted to see my day; and he saw [it] and rejoiced.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mystery of prophetic vision. Abraham, though in the past, looked forward to the Incarnation ("my day"). He saw it by faith and revelation (`ειδεν`) and was filled with joy (`εχαρη`). The Patriarch is a witness for Christ, not against Him. The Old Covenant finds its joy in the New.

**Verse 57**

**Greek Text**
ειπαν ουν οι ϊουδαιοι προϲ αυ · πεντηκον ετη ουπω εχειϲ και αβρααμʼ εωρα ϲε εωρακαϲ ·

**English Translation**
The Jews therefore said to h[im]: You have not yet fifty years, and has Abraham seen you [or] have you seen [him]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They are trapped in chronological time. Seeing a man not yet fifty (the age of maturity), they mock the impossibility of a meeting. The text here is confused (`εωρα ϲε εωρακαϲ`), stumbling between "Has Abraham seen you?" and "Have you seen Abraham?", reflecting the scribal struggle with the paradox of the Eternal entering time.

**Verse 58**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν αυ ο αμην αμ λεγω ϋμιν · πριν αβρααμʼ γενεϲθαι εγω ειμι ·

**English Translation**
J[esus] said to th[em]: Amen am[en] I say to you: Before Abraham was born, I am.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The thunderclap of Divinity. *Ego eimi*. He does not say "I was," but "I am," claiming the eternal existence of the Godhead. He places Abraham in the realm of becoming (`γενεϲθαι`), but Himself in the realm of being. He is the pre-existent Word, the God of Abraham.

**Verse 59**

**Greek Text**
ηραν ο λιθουϲ ϊνα βαλωϲ βαλωϲ επ αυτον · δε ε και εξηλθ εκ του ϊερου και διελθων δια μεϲου αυτ επορευετο και παρηγεν ουτωϲ και διελθων δια μεϲου αυτ

**English Translation**
Therefore they took up stones that they might cast [cast] upon him; but [he] [hid?] and went out of the temple, and passing through the midst of th[em] he went his way and passed by thus and passing through the midst of th[em].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The response to the Divine Name is lethal violence. They seek to stone Him for blasphemy. But the text describes a miracle of elusion: He passes "through the midst of them" (`δια μεϲου αυτ`), perhaps rendered invisible or untouchable by divine power. The extensive repetition in this manuscript suggests the magnitude of the miracle or a conflation of texts. He departs the physical Temple, for He is the true Temple they have rejected.
