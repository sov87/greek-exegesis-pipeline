**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ταυτ λελαληκα · ϊνα μη ϲκανδαλιϲθη ·

**English Translation**
These things I have spoken, so that you might not be scandalized.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the pastoral solicitude of the Lord. He speaks of the coming persecutions not to terrify, but to fortify. The word *skandalisthē* implies a stumbling block, a trap that causes one to fall. The "scandal" of the Cross is great, but the scandal of the suffering Church is also a trial for the faithful. By predicting the trial, He removes the shock of the unexpected, transforming the stumbling block into a stepping stone of endurance.

**Verse 2**


**Greek Text**
αποϲυναγωγουϲ γαρ ποιηϲωϲιν ϋμαϲ · αλλα ερχεται ωρα ϊνα παϲ ο απο · δο λατριαν προϲ τω ·

**English Translation**
For they shall make you put-out-of-synagogues; but an hour is coming that everyone who [from/kills?]... [may give/think] service to the [God?].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here bears the marks of haste or struggle, with "ο απο" hanging incomplete—surely implying the one who kills or destroys—and "δο" suggesting the offering of a gift or an opinion (*doxē*). Yet the meaning pierces through the scribal veil: a time of such inverted morality that murder is dressed in the vestments of liturgy (*latrian*). The persecutor is dangerous not because he is irreligious, but because he is wrongly religious, mistaking the blood of saints for a sacrifice to the Divine.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και ταυτα ποιηϲωϲιν ϋμιν · οτι ουκ εγνω τον πατερα · ου εμε ·

**English Translation**
And these things they will do to you; because they knew not the Father, nor me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the root of all persecution: ignorance (*agnoia*). It is not merely a lack of information, but a failure of relationship. They claim to serve God, yet they know not the Father. Why? Because they have rejected the Son. The Lord establishes an unbreakable theological bond: one cannot possess the Father while denying the Son. Their violence is the fruit of their blindness to the Image of God standing before them.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
αλλα ταυτα λελαληκα · ϊ αν εαν ελθη η ωρα αυτ μνημονευηται αυτων αυτων · οτι εγω ει ϋμιν ταυτα δε ϋμ εξ αρχηϲ ουκ ειπ · οτι μεθ ϋμων η ˙

**English Translation**
But these things I have spoken, that whenever the hour of them comes, you might remember them [them]; that I said [these things] to you. But these things I said not to you from the beginning, because I was with you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord points to memory as the antidote to despair. The repetition in the text—"of them of them"—emphasizes the intensity of that future hour. While the Bridegroom was present ("with you"), the children of the bridechamber had no need to fear the external dark. His physical presence was their shield. Now, as He prepares to depart, He arms them with prophecy, so that when the blow strikes, they will remember His voice and find their courage not in the circumstance, but in His foreknowledge.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
νυν δε εγω ϋ προϲ τον πεμ με · και ουδιϲ εξ ϋμων ερωτα με · που ϋπαγει ϋπαγειϲ ·

**English Translation**
But now I [go] to the [One having sent] me; and no one of you asks me: Where [he goes / do you go]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Sorrow has silenced their spiritual curiosity. The scribe writes "he goes / you go" (*hypagei / hypageis*), a stutter that mirrors the disciples' confusion. They are so consumed by the loss of His presence that they fail to inquire about His destination. Yet, His destination is their hope! If they understood the glory of where He goes—to the Father who sent Him—they would rejoice. But grief fixes the eyes on the earth, while the Lord bids them look to the ascent.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
αλ οτι ταυτα λελαλη ϋμιν · η λυπη πε την καρδιαν ·

**English Translation**
But because I have spoken these things to you, the grief [has filled] the heart.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The heart is a vessel. Here, the text indicates it is filled (*peplērōken*, abbreviated as *pe*) with *lypē*—heavy, oppressive grief. Because there is no room left in the heart, they cannot receive the joy of His glorification. The Lord diagnoses their condition: they are full of the immediate sorrow, leaving no space for the coming Comforter. He must empty them of this worldly grief to fill them with the Spirit.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ε την αληθει αληθει λεγω ϋμιν · ϲυμ ϋμιν ϊνα εγω απελθω ˙ εαν γαρ μη απελθω . ο πα ουκ ε προϲ ημαϲ υμαϲ · εαν δε πορευθω · πεμψω αυτον προϲ ϋμαϲ ·

**English Translation**
But I speak the [truth truth] to you; it is [profitable] for you that I go away. For if I do not go away, the [Paraclete] will not [come] to [us/you]; but if I go, I will send him to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A hard saying, marked by the emphasis of "truth truth." How can it be profitable (*sympherei*) to lose the Savior? Because the physical presence of Christ is localized, but the Pneumatic presence is universal. The scribe wavers between "to us" (*hēmas*) and "to you" (*hymas*), capturing a profound reality: the Paraclete comes to the whole Body ("us") and the individual believer ("you"). The Ascension is the necessary prerequisite for Pentecost; the Son must reign above for the Spirit to dwell within.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και ελθων · εκεινοϲ ελεγξει τ τ κοϲμον : περι αμαρτιαϲ · και περι δικαιοϲυνηϲ ˙ και περι κριϲεωϲ ·

**English Translation**
And having come, that one will convict [the the] world: concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Spirit acts as a Prosecutor against the *kosmos*. The word *elegxei* means to refute, to convict, to expose. The world feels secure in its judgment of Christ, but the Spirit will reverse the tribunal. The double article "the the" before world underlines the specific, fallen order that stands opposed to God. This is not a teaching for the faithful alone, but a cosmic verdict delivered by the Advocate.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
περι αμαρτιαϲ μεν · οτι ου πιϲτευουϲιν ει εμε ˙

**English Translation**
Concerning sin indeed; because they believe not in me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the redefinition of sin. The Law defined sin as transgression of statutes; the Spirit defines sin as the rejection of the Person. To not believe in the Son is the capital crime of the cosmos. It is the refusal of the Remedy. All other sins might be washed away, but the refusal of the Fount of cleansing leaves the sinner in their guilt.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
περι δικαιο δε · οτι προϲ τον πατερα ϋπαγω · και ουκετι θεωρει με ·

**English Translation**
And concerning [righteousness]; because I go to the Father, and no longer [do you see] me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
How is His departure a proof of righteousness? The world condemned Him as a malefactor and a blasphemer. But the Father, by receiving Him into glory, vindicates Him as the Righteous One. His going "to the Father" is the divine seal upon His ministry. We see Him no longer with eyes of flesh, but this very absence is the proof of His acceptance in the courts of Heaven, overturning the verdict of Pilate.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
περι δε κριϲεωϲ · οτι ο αρχων του κο τουτου κεκρι ˙

**English Translation**
And concerning judgment; because the ruler of this [world] [has been judged].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The judgment is not merely future; it is an accomplished fact (*kekritai*, perfect tense). The "ruler of this world"—the devil—thought he judged Christ on the Cross, but in that very act, he was judged and cast out. The Spirit reveals that the apparent power of evil is a sham; its head has already been crushed. The verdict has been rendered, even if the sentence is not yet fully executed in our sight.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ετι πολλα εχω ϋμιν λεγειν · αλλ ου δυναϲθαι βαϲτα αρτι ·

**English Translation**
Still I have many things to say to you, but you are not able [to bear] [them] just now.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord practices divine economy. Truth has weight; it must be "borne" (*bastazein*). Just as a child cannot carry a heavy load, the disciples, still carnal and grief-stricken, cannot yet bear the full revelation of the Trinity and the Church. He withholds not out of stinginess, but out of mercy, waiting for the Spirit to strengthen their spiritual shoulders. We must grow into the capacity to endure the weight of Glory.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
οταν δε ελθη εκεινοϲ · το τηϲ αληθιαϲ · οδη εν τη αληθεια παϲη · ου γαρ λα αφ εαυτου · αλλʼ οϲἁ οϲα ακουει λα . και τα ερχο αναγγελλει η υμιν

**English Translation**
But when that one comes—the [one] of the truth—[he] guides in all the truth; for [he] speaks not from himself, but as many things as [he] hears [he] speaks; and the coming things [he] announces to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the masculine pronoun *ekeinos* ("that one") juxtaposed with the neuter article *to* ("the"). The scribe, in his haste, omits the noun *pneuma* (Spirit), leaving us "the [entity] of the truth," yet the masculine pronoun preserves the personhood of the Paraclete against those who would reduce Him to a mere force. The text is abbreviated here—*hodē* for *hodēgēsei* (guides) and *la* for *lalēsei* (speaks)—reflecting the urgency of the scribe. The Spirit does not speak from Himself, establishing the unity of the Divine Will; He speaks what He hears from the Father and Son, revealing the "coming things" (*ercho*), the eschatological mysteries.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
εκεινοϲ εμε δοξαϲει · οτι εκ του εμου λημψεται · κ(αι) αναγγελλει ϋμιν

**English Translation**
That one will glorify me, because out of mine he will receive, and will announce to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the economy of the Trinity laid bare. The Spirit (*ekeinos*) has a specific mission: the glorification of the Son. The verb *lēmpsetai* (he will receive) indicates the consubstantial flow of wisdom; the Spirit does not invent a new revelation but unveils the depths of the Son. The scribe uses the standard abbreviation for *kai* (and), linking the reception of divine truth directly to its proclamation to the faithful (*hymin*).

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
παντα οϲα εχι ο εμα εϲτιν δια τουτο ειπον οτι εκ του εμου λαμβανι κ(αι) αναγγελι υ̇μιν

**English Translation**
All things as many as the [Father] has are mine; on account of this I said that out of mine he receives and announces to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads *hosa echi o* ("as many as has the..."). The subject *patēr* (Father) is absent in the ink but demanded by the logic of the definite article *o*. This textual ellipse invites us to contemplate the Unnamed One. The Lord claims absolute possession—"are mine"—asserting equality with the Unnamed Source. The scribe employs itacism (*lambani* for *lambanei*, *anaggeli* for *anaggellei*), yet the theology remains pristine: the Spirit draws from the Son's fullness, which is identical to the Father's fullness.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
μεικρον και ουκε θεωρειτε με · και παλιν μικρον και οψεϲθε με ·

**English Translation**
A little while and no longer do you behold me; and again a little while and you will see me;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript spells "little" variously as *meikron* and *mikron* in the same breath, a human variance in the face of divine mystery. The distinction of verbs is crucial: *theōreite* (behold physically/contemplate) versus *opsesthe* (will see/experience spiritually or in the Resurrection). The "no longer" (*ouke*, truncated from *ouketi*) marks the cessation of earthly sight at the Passion; the promise of "seeing" points to the Easter vision.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ειπ ουν εκ των μαθη αυτου προϲ αλ · τι εϲτιν τουτο ο λεγει ημ μικρον και ου θεωριται με και παλιν ˙ μικρον και οψε με · και ω οτι ϋπα προϲ τον πατε ·

**English Translation**
Said therefore [some] of his disciples to one another: "What is this which he says to us: 'A little while and you behold me not, and again a little while and you will see me?' And: 'Because I go to the Father?'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is heavily compressed (*mathē* for disciples, *al* for one another, *ēm* for us, *ypa* for I go, *pate* for Father). This scribal compression mirrors the disciples' hurried confusion. They quote the Lord but stumble over the meaning. The phrase *kai ō* is a slip for *kai hoti* ("and because"). Their confusion links the "little while" of blindness to the mystery of His departure to the Father, a connection they state but do not comprehend.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ελεγον ουν τι εϲτιν τουτο το ο λεγι ˙ μι ουκ οιδαμεν τι λαλει ·

**English Translation**
They were saying therefore: "What is this which he says: the 'little'? We know not what he speaks."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe truncates *mikron* to merely *mi*, as if the disciples are stuttering over the brevity of the time. "The *mi*"—the concept of the interval—is the stumbling block. They confess ignorance (*ouk oidamen*). It is a pastoral comfort to us that the Apostles themselves struggled to grasp the temporal dynamics of the Passion.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
εγνω ο οτι ημελλον αυτ ερωταν · και ειπεν αυτοιϲ · περι τουτου ζητειτε μετ αλλη · οτι ειπον μι και ου θεω με και παλ μικρον και οψε με ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] knew that they were about to ask him, and said to them: "Concerning this do you seek with one another, because I said: 'A little [while] and you behold me not, and again a little while and you will see me?'"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The subject *Iēsous* is missing, represented only by the article *o* ("The [One] knew"). The omniscience of the Lord is immediate; He perceives the intent before the question is voiced. The text repeats the riddle of the *mikron* (abbreviated again as *mi*). He does not immediately explain, but validates their questioning, forcing them to dwell on the paradox of absence and presence.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
αμην α λεγω ϋμιν · ο κλαυϲετε και θρη θρηνηϲετε ϋμιϲ · ο δε κοϲμοϲ χαρηϲε · ϋμιϲ δε λυπηθη · αλλʼ η λυπη ϋμων ειϲ χαραν γε ˙

**English Translation**
Amen [amen] I say to you, that you will weep and lament [lament], but the world will rejoice; and you will be grieved, but your grief into joy will become.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex exhibits significant stuttering here: *amēn a* (likely for Amen Amen) and *thrē thrēnēsete* (lament lament). This scribal dittography inadvertently captures the heaving sobs of the disciples. The world's joy (*charēse* for *charēsetai*) is contrasted with the disciples' grief. But the promise is metamorphic: grief does not merely end; it *becomes* (*ge* for *genēsetai*) joy. The sorrow is the raw material of the resurrection gladness.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
η γυνη ο τικτη · λυπην εχει οτι ηλθεν η ωρα αυτηϲ ˙ οταν δε γεννηϲη το παι · ουκετι μνη τηϲ θλι δια την χαρ χαρ · οτι εγεννηθη ο ειϲ τον κο ·

**English Translation**
The woman when she gives birth has grief because her hour came; but when she bears the child, no longer does she remember the tribulation on account of the joy [joy], that a man was born into the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord uses the metaphor of labor. The text reads *tikti* (gives birth), a present reality. The scribe repeats *char* (*charan*), writing "on account of the joy joy." This double joy emphasizes the overwhelming nature of the new life. The *thli* (tribulation) is forgotten. The birth of "the man" (*o* for *anthrōpos*) into the "world" (*ko* for *kosmon*) is the archetype of Christ emerging from the tomb, the firstborn of the dead.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
και ϋμειϲ ν μεν ουν ουν ν μεν λυπην ε εξεται · παλιν δε οψο ϋμαϲ · και χαρη η καρδι · και την χαραν ϋ · ουδιϲ αιρει α ϋμων ·

**English Translation**
And you now indeed therefore [therefore now indeed] grief will have; but again I will see you, and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript is in disarray here: *n men oun oun n men*. The scribe struggles, perhaps correcting himself or copying a corrupted exemplar. It reads "now indeed therefore therefore now indeed." This chaotic text reflects the chaos of the disciples' current state. *e exetai* is a stutter for *exete* (you have). Yet the promise pierces through the textual noise: *opso* (I will see [you]). It is His sight of us that guarantees the joy that cannot be taken away (*airei*).

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και εν εκει τη ημερα · εμε ουκ ερωτηϲηται ου : αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν · οτι ο ἁν αιτη τον πατερα · δωϲει εν τω ονοματι μου ·

**English Translation**
And in that day me you will ask nothing. Amen amen I say to you, that whatever you ask the Father, he will give in my name.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"That day" refers to the time of the Spirit. The text says *erōtēsētai* (ask/interrogate) *ou* (nothing/no one). The double negative emphasizes the end of riddles; they will no longer need to ask about the "little while." The access to the Father is direct. The scribe omits the object of "give" (*dōsei*), implying He will give *it* (the request) or perhaps *Himself*.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
εωϲ αρτι ουκ ητηϲαται ουδεν εν τω ονο μου · αιτηϲαϲ αιτιται και λημψεϲθε · ϊνα η χαρα ϋμων ῆ πεπληρωμενη ·

**English Translation**
Until now you asked nothing in my name; [having asked] ask and you will receive, in order that your joy may be fulfilled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text contains a grammatical collision: *aitēsas aititai* (having asked, he asks / or perhaps a corruption of *aiteite*, "ask!"). We must read this through the lens of the scribe's struggle: the command is to ask. The result is *lēmpsesthe* (you will receive). The purpose clause reveals the goal of the Christian life: *chara... peplērōmenē* (joy fulfilled). The Codex preserves the subjunctive *ē* (may be), indicating that this fullness is a spiritual potentiality dependent on the act of asking in the Name.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα εν παροιμι λελαληκα · ερχεται ωρα οπου οτε ουκετι εν παροι λαληϲω ϋ · αλλα παρρηϲι περι του πατροϲ απαγγελλω ϋμιν ˙

**English Translation**
These things I have spoken in riddles; an hour comes where [when] I will speak to you no longer in riddles, but in plainness concerning the Father I will report to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the pedagogy of the Logos. He distinguishes between the time of *paroimiai*—dark sayings and proverbs suited for those yet infants in understanding—and the coming hour of *parrhesia*, or bold, unclouded speech. The scribe’s peculiar conjunction *hopou ote* (where when) suggests a convergence of time and place; the "where" is the spiritual state of the believer, and the "when" is the post-Resurrection illumination. He promises not merely to speak *of* God, but to *report* (apangellō) the Father, implying a direct transmission of the paternal reality to the soul.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
εν εκεινη τη η · αιτηϲαϲθαι εν τω ονοματι μου · και ου λεγω ϋμιν · οτι εγω ερω τον πατερα περι ϋμων ˙

**English Translation**
In that day you shall ask in my name; and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery of mediation is laid bare. The Lord does not say He will *not* intercede, but rather that the need for Him to petition the Father as if the Father were reluctant is abolished. By asking "in the name," the disciples are so united to the Son that they possess the ear of the Father directly. The unity of will between Father and Son is such that the Son need not persuade the Father to love His own elect; the love is already perfect and flowing.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ γαρ ο πατηρ φιλει ϋμαϲ · οτι ϋμειϲ με πεφιληκατε και πεπιϲτευκατε · οτι εγω παρα εξηλ ˙

**English Translation**
For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came out from [Him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the chain of divine affection (*philia*). The Father’s love for the disciples is contingent upon their reception of the Son. It is impossible to be loved by the Source while rejecting the Stream. The text reads *para exēl* (came out from), emphasizing the procession of the Son. To believe that Christ "came out" is to confess His pre-existence and His consubstantial origin. The Father loves those who recognize His Image.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθον πα του πατροϲ · και εληλυθα ειϲ τον κοϲμον ˙ παλιν αφιημι τον κοϲμ κοϲμ · και πορευομαι προϲ τον πατερα ˙

**English Translation**
I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again I leave the world [world], and I go to the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the summary of the entire Economy of Salvation in four movements: the eternal generation and mission (*exēlthon*), the Incarnation (*elēlytha*), the Passion and Ascension (*aphiēmi*), and the session at the right hand (*poreuomai*). The scribe’s error in repeating *kosm kosm* (world world) inadvertently doubles the emphasis on what is being abandoned. The Lord leaves the world not in presence, for He is with us always, but in mode of existence; He returns to the glory which He had with the Father.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
λεγουϲιν οι μαθη αυτω αυτου ϊδε νυν εν παρρηϲια λαλειϲ · και παροιμιαν ου λεγειϲ ·

**English Translation**
The disciples [of him] say to him: Behold, now you speak in plainness, and you say no riddle.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples, in their eagerness, believe the promised hour has fully arrived before the Passion has even occurred. They contrast the *paroimian* (riddle) with the *parrhesia* (plainness), claiming to understand the mystery. Yet, their understanding is fragile, resting on the comfort of the moment rather than the power of the Cross. They grasp the clarity of His speech but have yet to endure the scandal of His suffering.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ν ν οιδαμεν · οτι οιδαϲ παντα · και ου χρι εχειϲ ϊνα τιϲ ϲε ερωτα · εν τουτω πιϲτευομεν · οτι απο εξηλθεϲ ·

**English Translation**
Now [now] we know that you know all things, and have no need that anyone should ask you; in this we believe that you came out from [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition *n n* (now now) by the hand of the scribe marks the urgency of their confession. They attribute omniscience to the Son—"You know all things"—which is a prerogative of Divinity alone. They believe He came *apo* (from) the divine realm because He discerned the unasked questions in their hearts. Faith here is born from the experience of being known by God; to be understood by the Savior is the catalyst for believing in the Savior.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
α αυτοιϲ ο · αρτι πιϲτευε ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] [answered] them: Do you now believe?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is stark and abbreviated, reflecting the sharpness of the rebuke. *Arti pisteue*—is your faith real at this precise moment? The Lord questions not the sincerity of their current feeling, but the durability of their conviction. It is a warning against the presumption of strength before the onset of temptation. He sees the scattering that approaches, even as they proclaim their loyalty.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ϊδου ερχεται ωρα · και εληλυθ · η ωρα ϊνα ϲκορ εκαϲτοϲ ειϲ τα ϊδια · καμε μονον αφητε ˙ και ουκ ειμι μο · οτι ο πατηρ μετ εμου εϲτιν ˙

**English Translation**
Behold, an hour comes and has come, [the hour] that you may be scattered each to his own, and leave me alone; and I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The prophecy of abandonment. The flock shall be scattered (*skorpisthēte*), a term recalling the wolf among sheep. They will retreat *eis ta idia* (to their own things), prioritizing self-preservation over the Covenant. Yet, observe the Christological absolute: "I am not alone." The union of the Father and Son is unbreakable even in the desolation of the Cross. The presence of the Father is the Son's solace when human fidelity crumbles.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα λελαληκα ϋμιν · ϊνα εν εμοι ειρηνην εχηται · εν τω κοϲμω θλι εχετε · αλλα θαρ · εγω νενι τον κοϲμ κοϲμ ·

**English Translation**
These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have peace; in the world you have tribulation; but take courage, I have overcome the world [world].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final seal of the discourse. Two realms are set before us: *en emoi* (in Me) where there is peace, and *en tō kosmō* (in the world) where there is *thli* (tribulation/pressure). The victory is announced in the perfect tense (*nenikēka*—I have conquered), signifying that the defeat of the world is already an accomplished fact in the divine will, even before the wood of the Cross is raised. The scribe’s stutter on *kosm kosm* emphasizes the totality of the fallen order which lies vanquished beneath the feet of the Victor.
