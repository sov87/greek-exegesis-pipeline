**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπων · ε ϲυν αυτοιϲ τοιϲ τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ αυτου περαν του χιμαρ του κεδρου των κεδρων · ο ην κηποϲ · ει ον ειϲηλθεν αυτοϲ · και οι μαθη αυτου

**English Translation**
Having said these things, [he went] out with them the the disciples of him beyond the torrent of the cedar of the cedars; where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and the disciples of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s trembling hand, repeating "the the" (*tois tois*) and confusing the brook Kidron with "cedar of the cedars" (*kedrou tōn kedrōn*). Yet, the mystery remains intact. As the first Adam fell in a garden, the Second Adam now enters a garden to restore our nature. He crosses the "torrent" (*chimar*), a symbol of the turbulent waters of death he is about to calm. He enters not alone, but with his disciples, for where the Head goes, the Body must follow, even into the shadow of the passion.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ηδει δε κ(αι) ϊουδαϲ ο παραδι αυτον τον τοπον · οτι πολλα ϲυνηχθη ε μετα των μα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And Judas also, the one betr[aying] him, knew the place; because often gathered J[esus] with the disc[iples] of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the traitor uses intimacy as a weapon. The text abbreviates the Holy Name (*E*) and the act of betrayal (*paradi*), as if shrinking from the horror. The Lord had made this garden a sanctuary of prayer, a church without walls where he "gathered" (*synēchthē*)—a word used for our holy assemblies. Judas knew the liturgy of his Master’s habits, and thus turns the place of prayer into the place of perdition.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ο ο ο ϊουδαϲ λαβων τ τ ϲπειραν · και εκ τ αρχϊερεων και εκ των εκ των φαριϲαιων ϋπηρεταϲ · ερχεται εκι μετα φανων και λαμπαδων και ο :

**English Translation**
The the the Judas having taken the the cohort, and from the chief priests and from the from the Pharisees officers, comes there with lanterns and torches and w[eapons].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers with a triple article (*o o o*) and double articles, mirroring the chaotic multitude coming against the Silence of the Word. They bring "lanterns and torches" to find the Sun of Righteousness, foolishly thinking earthly fire can illuminate the Light of the World. The verse ends abruptly with *o*—likely *oplōn* (weapons)—truncated, signifying that their carnal weapons are nothing before the Divine Will.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
δε ειδωϲ παντα τα ερχομενα επ αυ · εξελθων ειπ ειπ αυτοιϲ · τινα ζητει ·

**English Translation**
[He] but knowing all the things coming upon h[im], having gone out, said said to them: Whom seek [ye]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the sovereignty of the Lord. He is not found hidden; he "goes out" (*exelthōn*) to meet them. His foreknowledge is absolute ("knowing all"). The scribe repeats "said said" (*eip eip*), inadvertently emphasizing the authority of His voice. He asks "Whom seek ye?" not from ignorance, but to force them to confess their intent, making them witnesses to their own crime.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲαν αυτω · τον ναζω · λεγει αυτοιϲ · εγω ειμι · ϊϲτηκει δε και ϊουδαϲ ο πα αυτον μετ αυτων ·

**English Translation**
They answered him: The Nazo[rean]. He says to them: I am. And stood also Judas the one betr[aying] him with them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They name him by his earthly obscurity, "The Nazorean" (*Nazō*). He answers with the Divine Name, "I AM" (*Ego eimi*). Here is the great separation: Judas stands "with them." He is no longer numbered among the disciples but stands with the world. To stand with the persecutors is to fall from grace.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ ουν ειπεν αυτοιϲ εγω ειμι α ειϲ τα οπι · και επεϲαν χαμαι ˙

**English Translation**
As therefore he said to them I am, [they went] backward and fell on the ground.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the power of the Divinity within the flesh! He does not strike them; He merely exists. The utterance of "I am" casts the armed cohort to the earth. The text is rugged here (*a eis ta opi*), showing the confusion of the moment. They fall "on the ground" (*chamai*), for they are of the earth, and the Voice of Heaven prostrates them. This proves He surrendered voluntarily; they could not touch Him had He not permitted it.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
παλιν ουν αυτουϲ επηρωτη · τινα ζητειτε ˙ οι δε ειπον . τ τ ναζωραιον ˙

**English Translation**
Again therefore them he asked: Whom seek ye? And they said: The the Nazorean.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He raises them up only to question them again, giving them a moment for repentance after the miracle of their fall. Yet their hearts are hardened; they repeat the stuttering earthly title, "The the Nazorean." They see the man, but the "I AM" is hidden from their darkened eyes.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
απε · ειπον ϋ · οτι εγω ειμι ˙ ει ουν εμε ζητει · αφετε τουτουϲ ϋπαγειν ·

**English Translation**
He ans[wered]: I said to y[ou] that I am; if therefore me ye seek, suffer these to go.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Good Shepherd, laying down his life for the sheep. He offers Himself (*eme*) as the ransom to secure the liberty of the disciples ("suffer these to go"). He negotiates not for His own safety, but for the Church's remnant. The text is abbreviated, hasty, as the moment of arrest draws near.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα πλη ο λογοϲ ον ειπεν · οτι ουϲ δε μοι · ουκ α εξ αυτ ουδενα :

**English Translation**
That might be ful[filled] the word which he said: That [those] whom [you gave] to me, I did not l[ose] of th[em] no one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The physical preservation of the disciples here is a type of their eternal preservation. The scribe struggles with the Greek (*ous de moi* instead of *dedōkas*), yet the theological truth stands: Not one given by the Father to the Son shall be lost. Even in the chaos of the garden, the economy of salvation is being perfectly fulfilled.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ϲιμων ουν πετροϲ εχων μαχαιραν · ειλκυϲεν αυτην · και επεϲεν τον δουλον του αρχϊ · και απεκο αυτου το ωτα το δεξιον · ην δε ονομα τω δου μαλχοϲ :

**English Translation**
Simon therefore Peter having a sword, drew it, and fell [struck] the slave of the high pr[iest], and cut off of him the ear the right; was and name to the sla[ve] Malchos.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, fervent in spirit but ignorant of the mystery, attempts to fight spiritual battles with carnal iron. The text reads "fell" (*epesen*) instead of "struck" (*epaisen*), a curious slip—perhaps implying the violence itself was a fall for Peter. He cuts the "right ear," symbolizing the removal of the hearing of the Law, for the High Priest's servant can no longer hear the old covenant correctly. The name Malchos is preserved, for the Lord knows even the enemies He heals.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν ο τω πετρω · βαλε την μαχαιραν ειϲ την θηκην · το ποτηρι · ο δεδωκεν μοι ο πατηρ · ου μη πι αυτο ˙

**English Translation**
Said therefore the [Jesus] to Peter: Cast the sword into the sheath; the cup which has given to me the Father, shall I not dr[ink] it?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord rebukes the sword. The "cup" (*potēri*) is the destiny of suffering ordained by the Father. To refuse the cup is to refuse the salvation of the world. The verb "drink" is cut short (*pi*), emphasizing the urgency. He does not merely taste it; He must consume the wrath fully. Peter would save the Body, but the Head knows that death is the only path to Life.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
η ουν ϲπι και ο χιλιαρχοϲ · και οι ϋπηρεται των ϊουδαιων . ϲυ τον · και εδηϲαν αυτον

**English Translation**
The therefore coh[ort] and the chiliarch and the officers of the Jews, [seized] the [Jesus], and bound him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text collapses into fragments: "coh[ort]," "[seized] the." It is the hour of darkness. They bind (*edēsan*) the One who looses the chains of sin. A chiliarch (commander of a thousand) is needed to arrest a single man of peace. They bind his hands, not knowing that by these very bonds, He will draw all men unto Himself.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και ηγαγον απηγαγον προϲ ανναν πρωτον ˙ γαρ πενθεροϲ του καϊαφα · ὁϲ ην αρχϊ του ενιαυ εκεινου ·

**English Translation**
And they led, led [Him] away to Annas first; for [he] was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest of that year.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the scribe’s duplication *egagon apegagon* (led, led away). It betrays the haste and roughness of the soldiers; they did not merely guide the Lamb, but dragged Him with force. They bring the Eternal High Priest to Annas, a man holding authority by fleshly relation (father-in-law) rather than divine right. The text notes Caiaphas was priest "of that year" (*tou eniau ekeinou*), marking the priesthood as fleeting and temporal, unlike the priesthood of Melchizedek which Christ bears forever.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ην δε καϊαφαϲ · ο ϲυμ τοιϲ ϊ · οτι ϲυμ ενα ανθρω αποθανιν ϋπερ του λαου ·

**English Translation**
Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews that it is advantageous for one man to die on behalf of the people.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of iniquity and prophecy intertwined. The scribe abbreviates *symbouleusas* (advised) to *sym*, as if shrinking from the full weight of this bloody counsel. Caiaphas speaks from political expediency, yet the Spirit speaks through him of theological necessity. One man (*ena anthro*) must indeed die, not to save the political nation, but to ransom the spiritual people (*tou laou*) from death itself.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ηκο δε τω ϲι πετροϲ · και ο αλλοϲ μαθητηϲ · ο δε μαθητηϲ ε · ην γνω τω αρχϊερει · και ϲυνειϲηλθεν τω · ειϲ την αυλ αυλ του αρχϊερεωϲ ·

**English Translation**
Now Peter was following the [Si...], and the other disciple; and that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered with the [Lord?] into the court, court of the high priest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here struggles, writing *to si petros*—perhaps a confusion of "Simon Peter" or a truncated reference to the Lord (*to Iesou*). We see Peter following, but the "other disciple" (John himself) has access. Note the repetition *aul aul* (court, court). It emphasizes the enclosure, the trap into which the Shepherd has entered and the sheep follows at a distance. The "court" of the earthly priest becomes the tribunal for the Heavenly Priest.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πετροϲ · ϊϲτηκει εξω προϲ τη θυρα ˙ εξηλθεν ουν ο μαθητηϲ ο αλλοϲ · ὁϲ ην γνωϲτοϲ τω αρχϊερει · και ει τη θυρωρω . και ειϲηνεγκε τον πετρον ·

**English Translation**
But Peter stood outside at the door. Therefore the other disciple went out, who was known to the high priest, and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought in Peter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter stands *exo* (outside). This is his spiritual condition as much as his physical location. He is outside the mystery of the Passion, attempting to understand it with fleshly courage. The other disciple mediates, speaking to the *thyroro* (female doorkeeper), bringing Peter from the safety of the "outside" into the danger of the "inside," where his faith shall be sifted like wheat.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ουν η παιδιϲκη η θυ τω πετρω · μη και ϲυ εκ των μαθητων ει του ανθρωπου τουτου ˙ λεγει εκεινοϲ · ου ειμι ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the girl, the doorkeeper, says to Peter: "Are you not also of the disciples of this man?" That one says: "I am not."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the collapse of human strength. A mere *paidiske* (servant girl) guarding the door topples the Rock. While Christ in the garden declared "I Am" (*Ego eimi*) and the soldiers fell back, here Peter declares "I am not" (*ou eimi*) and falls from grace. He denies his identity to preserve his life, separating himself from "this man" (*tou anthropou toutou*), a phrase of contempt used by the world for our Lord.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ϊϲτηκιϲαν δε και οι δουλοι και οι · ανθρα πεποιηκοτεϲ · οτι ψυχοϲ ην και εθερμαινοντο ˙ δε και ο πετροϲ με αυτων εϲτωϲ και θερμαινομενοϲ ·

**English Translation**
Now the slaves and the [officers] stood, having made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves; and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *anthrakian* (charcoal fire) burns, illuminating the faces of Christ's enemies. It was *psychos* (cold)—a coldness of the night, but more so a coldness of the heart. Peter stands *met auton* (with them). He seeks the warmth of the world because he has abandoned the warmth of the Spirit. He warms his flesh while his soul freezes in the act of denial.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ο ουν αρχϊερευϲ ηρωτηϲε τον πε των μαθητων αυτου · και περι τηϲ διδαχηϲ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the high priest asked the [Pe...] concerning his disciples and concerning his teaching.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes *ton pe*, stumbling perhaps between *ton Petron* (Peter) and the Lord. Yet the context "concerning his disciples" proves he interrogates the Master. The world interrogates the Church on two counts: its membership (*matheton*) and its dogma (*didaches*). They seek to find conspiracy in the gathering and heresy in the teaching, but they find neither, for the Truth is open.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και απεκριθη αυτω αυτω · εγω παρρηϲια λε τω κοϲμω · εγω παντοτε εδι εν ϲυναγω και εν τω ϊερω · οπου παντεϲ οι ϊ ϲυνερχ ϲυνερχ · και εν κρυπτω ελαληϲα ουδεν

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] answered him, him: "I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, come together; and in secret I spoke nothing."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex stutters with *auto auto* (him, him) and *synerch synerch* (come together, come together), as if trembling at the Lord's defense. Christ appeals to *parresia* (openness/boldness). He has no secret, subversive doctrine. He taught where the people "come together." The Truth is catholic and public; it is the lies of the enemy that require the cover of darkness and secret councils.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
τι με ερωταϲ · ερωτη τουϲ ακηκο τι ελαληϲα αυτοιϲ · ϊδε ουτοι οι · ἁ ειπον ε

**English Translation**
"Why do you ask me? Ask those having heard what I spoke to them; behold, these know what I said."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord submits to the Law of evidence. He directs the judge to the witnesses (*tous akekootas*). Even in His humiliation, He instructs the High Priest on proper jurisprudence. The phrase *ha eipon e* (what I said [I?]) trails off in the manuscript, yet the meaning is sharp: the testimony of the Gospel is written in the hearts of the hearers, not just in the books of the scribes.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα δε αυτου ειπ ειπ ειϲ παρεϲτη των των παρεϲτηκοτων ϋπηρε εδωκεν ρα τω · ειπ ειπ · ουτωϲ αποκρινη τω αρχϊερει :

**English Translation**
Now when he said, said these things, one standing by, of the, of the officers standing by, gave a blow to the [Jesus], saying, saying: "Is this how you answer the high priest?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is convulsed with repetition: *eip eip* (said, said), *ton ton* (of the, of the), *eip eip* again. It mirrors the chaos and the flurry of the blow (*rapisma*) striking the Holy Face. A servant, zealous for the honor of a corrupt man, strikes the God of Glory. He asks, "Is this how you answer?" not knowing that the Answer (the Logos) stands before him, silent in majesty.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτω ει κακωϲ ειπον ελαληϲα μαρτυρηϲον περι του κακου · ει δε κα · τι με δεριϲ :

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] said to him: "If I spoke, spoke wrongly, bear witness concerning the wrong; but if well, why do you strike me?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ does not turn the other cheek in silence here, but with a demand for justice. He uses the double verb *eipon elalesa* (spoke, spoke) to emphasize the integrity of His word. If the Word is *kakos* (evil), prove it; if *kalos* (good/well), the violence is unjustified. He exposes the brute force that underpins their false authority. Reason confronts violence, and violence has no answer but more blows.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
απεϲτιλεν δε αυ ο ανναϲ δεδε · προϲ καϊ τον αρχϊερε

**English Translation**
Now Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Annas, defeated by the Truth he could not entrap, sends the Lord away. Observe the word *dedemenon* (bound). They bind the hands that liberated the sick and raised the dead. He is passed like a commodity from one judge to another (*pros Kaiaphan*), yet in this procession of shame, He walks as the Conqueror, bound in flesh but unbound in Spirit, marching toward the Cross to unbind the world from sin.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ϲιμων πε εϲτωϲ και θερ · ει ουν αυτω · μη και ϲυ εκ των ︴ μα αυτου ει · ηρνηϲατο εκεινοϲ και ειπεν · ουκ ειμι ·

**English Translation**
Now Simon Pe[ter] was standing and war[ming himself]; therefore they said to him: Are you not also of his di[sciples]? That one denied and said: I am not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the posture of the fallen Apostle: he is "standing and warming." He seeks the comfort of the fire while the Light of the World stands in the cold judgment of men. The text abbreviates the word for "disciples" (μα), as if Peter's denial cuts the title short. He does not merely say "no," but "I am not" (ουκ ειμι), a tragic inversion of the Lord's divine "I Am." By denying his place among the *mathētōn* (disciples), he attempts to sever the bond of grace, yet the Lord’s gaze remains upon him.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ειϲ εκ των δουλων του αρχϊ ϲυνγενηϲ ων · ου απεκοψεν πετροϲ το ωτιον · ουκ εγω ϲε ϊδον εν τω κηπω μετ αυτου ˙

**English Translation**
One of the slaves of the High Pr[iest] says, being a kinsman [of him] whose ear Peter cut off: Did I not see you in the garden with him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sin of Peter in the garden—his reliance on the sword—now returns to entrap him. The "kinsman" acts as a witness not just to Peter's presence, but to his violence. The garden, intended as a sanctuary of prayer, is cited here only as a crime scene. See how the scribe abbreviates "High Priest" (αρχϊ); the titles of worldly power are shortened, for they are fleeting, even as they threaten the eternal priesthood of Christ.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
παλιν ουν ηρνηϲα ο πετροϲ και ευ αλεκτωρ ε

**English Translation**
Therefore again Peter denied; and im[mediately] a rooster c[rowed].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is jagged, abbreviated (ηρνηϲα for denied, ευ for immediately, ε for crowed). It reflects the sudden, jarring nature of the fulfillment. There is no delay between the sin and the sign. The rooster, a creature of the morning, announces the light, but for Peter, it announces the darkness of his own heart. The beast obeys its nature and cries out; the Apostle denies his nature and falls silent to the truth.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
αγουϲ αγουϲ ουν τον απο του καϊαφα ειϲ το πραι ην δε πρω · και αυτοι ουκ ειϲηλ ειϲ το πραιτω · ϊνα μη μιαν · αλλα φαγωϲ φαγωϲ το παϲχα ˙

**English Translation**
They lead, they lead therefore the [Jesus] from Caiaphas into the Prae[torium]; now it was mor[ning]; and they themselves did not ent[er] into the Praetor[ium], in order that they might not be def[iled], but might eat, might eat the Passover.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the scribal repetition: "they lead, they lead" and "eat, eat." It reveals the frenetic urgency of the accusers. They are obsessed with ritual purity ("that they might not be defiled") while committing the greatest impurity: the murder of the Innocent One. They fear the dust of the Praetorium but not the blood of the Messiah. They desire to eat the shadow (the Passover lamb) while destroying the Substance (the Lamb of God).

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθεν ουν προϲ αυτουϲ ο πιλατοϲ εξω και φηϲιν τινα κατη φερετε κατα του ανθρωπου τουτου ˙

**English Translation**
Therefore Pilate went out outside to them and says: What accu[sation] do you bring against this man?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate, the Gentile, accommodates their hypocrisy by going "outside." The text shows the clash of two laws: the Jews bring a prisoner, but the Roman demands an "accusation" (κατηγορίαν, here abbreviated). The world asks for legal charges; the Church knows the only charge is His love for mankind. Pilate calls Him "this man," seeing only humanity where we discern Divinity.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲαν και ειπαν αυτω ˙ ει μη ην ουτοϲ κακον ποιηϲαϲ ποιων · ουκ αν ϲοι παρεδωκει αυτον ·

**English Translation**
They answered and said to him: If this one was not doing, doing evil, we would not have handed him over to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The accusers offer no specific charge, only a tautology of malice. The curious repetition "doing, doing evil" (ποιηϲαϲ ποιων) in the manuscript emphasizes their insistence on His guilt without proof. They demand Pilate trust their judgment, claiming that the act of handing Him over is proof enough of His criminality. It is the arrogance of a priesthood that has forgotten justice.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ ο πιλα · λαβετε αυτον ϋμιϲ · και κατα τ τ νομον κρι αυτον · ειπον ουν αυτω οι ϊουδαιοι · ημιν ουκ εξεϲτ αποκτιναι ουδε ι ουδενα

**English Translation**
Therefore Pila[te] said to them: You take him, and according to [the] the law jud[ge] him. Therefore the Jews said to him: It is not lawful for us to kill no o[ne], no one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate attempts to wash his hands early, returning the burden to the Jewish law. But the stuttering text ("the the law", "no one, no one") reveals the tension. The Jews confess their impotence: "It is not lawful for us to kill." Here is the mystery: the scepter has departed from Judah, for they have lost the power of the sword (jus gladii), signaling that Shiloh—the Messiah—has indeed come, yet they seek to use the Roman sword to slay Him.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα ο λογοϲ του πλη ον ειπεν ϲημαιν ποιω θανατω η αποθνη

**English Translation**
In order that the word of the [Lord] might be ful[filled], which he said signifying by what sort of death he was [about] to die.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist sees the hand of Providence in the Roman legal code. If the Jews had killed Him, He would have been stoned; but the decree was that He must be "lifted up" (crucified) to draw all men to Himself. The manuscript abbreviates "fulfilled" (πλη) and "die" (αποθνη), as if rushing to the Cross. The limitation of Jewish power was the ordination of divine prophecy.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ειϲηλθεν ουν ειϲ το πραιτω παλιν ο πιλα · και εφωνη τον · και ει αυτω ˙ ϲυ ει ο βαϲιλευϲ των ϊου ϊουδαιων ·

**English Translation**
Therefore Pila[te] entered again into the Praetor[ium] and called the [Jesus] and sa[id] to him: Are you the King of the Je[ws] Jews?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate retreats inside, separating Jesus from the mob. The question is political: "King." The scribe stutters on "Jews" (ϊου ϊουδαιων), perhaps trembling at the title. Pilate looks at a carpenter and asks about royalty. He interrogates the victim about a Kingdom he cannot see, unaware that he stands before the King of Kings who judges the nations.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτω ο · απο ϲε ϲυ τουτο ει λεγιϲ · η αλλοι ϲοι ει περι εμου ·

**English Translation**
The [Jesus] answered him: Do you say this from yourse[lf] you, or did others t[ell] you concerning me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Prisoner becomes the Interrogator. The Lord demands the source of the question. If Pilate asks "from yourself," he asks as a Roman about treason. If "others told" him, he asks as a mouthpiece for the Sanhedrin about theology. The Lord forces the soul to define its own stance: Do you seek the truth of yourself, or do you merely repeat the rumors of the world? The emphatic "from yourself you" (απο ϲε ϲυ) pierces the conscience.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο πιλα μη μητι εγω ϊου ειμι · το εθνοϲ το ϲον και ο αρχϊ οι αρχϊερειϲ παρεδωκ παρεδωκ ϲε εμοι · τι εποιη ·

**English Translation**
Pila[te] answered: [Am I] not, surely not a Jew? Your nation and the High Pr[iest], the High Priests handed, handed you over to me; what did you d[o]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate recoils with pride: "Am I a Jew?" He distances himself from the mystery. The manuscript shows confusion—first writing "High Priest" singular, then correcting to plural "High Priests," and repeating "handed over." It reflects the chaotic conspiracy. Pilate is pragmatic; he ignores the title of King and asks for the act: "What did you do?" He seeks a crime, but finds only the Creator.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη η εμη βαϲιλεια ουκ εϲτιν εκ του κοϲμου τουτου · ει εκ του κοϲμου τουτου ην η εμη βαϲιλια · και οι οι εμοι ηγω αν · μη παραδοθω τοιϲ ϊουδαιοιϲ ν δε η εμη βαϲιλει ουκ εϲτιν εντευ ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] answered: My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingd[om] was of this world, the, the [servants] of mine would fi[ght], that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but n[ow] my kingd[om] is not from he[re].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Good Confession. The Kingdom is real, but its origin (εκ) is not from the order of this world. The proof is the absence of violence: "my servants would fight." But they do not fight, for this King conquers by dying. The scribe repeats "the" (οι οι), emphasizing the specific nature of His servants. "But now" (ν δε) implies the Kingdom is present, yet "not from here" (εντευ). It descends from above; it does not arise from below.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυτω ο πιλατοϲ · ουκουν βαϲιλευϲ ει ϲυ απεκριθη ο · ϲυ λεγειϲ οτι βαϲι ειμι εγω ειϲ τουτο γεγεννη · και ειϲ τουτο εληλυθα ειϲ τ κοϲμον ˙ ϊνα μαρ μαρτυρηϲω περι τηϲ αληθιαϲ τη αληθια παϲ ο εκ τηϲ αληθιαϲ ακου μου τηϲ φω ·

**English Translation**
Pilate therefore said to him: "Art thou not then a king?" The [Jesus] answered: "Thou sayest that I am a king. I for this have been born, and for this have I come into the world, that I might bear witness concerning the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the precision of the Lord’s reply in the Codex. When asked of earthly sovereignty, He affirms the title *Basileus* (King) yet immediately anchors it in the divine economy. He distinguishes His dual nature: "For this have I been born" (*gegennēmai*) speaks to His humanity and the Incarnation; "for this have I come into the world" (*elēlytha*) reveals His pre-existence and divine mission. The scribe here stumbles, writing *mar* then *martyrēsō* (witness), as if trembling before the magnitude of this testimony. Christ asserts that His Kingdom is the dominion of Truth (*alētheias*). Those who belong to the Truth do not merely listen; they hear the voice (*phō*) of the Shepherd, distinguishing it from the clamor of the world.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ο πιλατοϲ τιϲ τι εϲτ αληθεια · και τουτο ειπων · παλιν εξηλθεν προϲ τουϲ και λεγει αυ · εγω ουδεμι αιτιαν ευριϲκω εν αυτω

**English Translation**
Pilate says to him: "Who— what is truth?" And having said this, again he went out to the [Jews] and says to them: "I find no fault in him."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here lies the tragedy of the Gentile mind that lacks revelation. The scribe of Sinaiticus records a profound slip: *tis ti* ("Who what"). Pilate begins to ask "Who," perhaps sensing the Person before him, but corrects himself to "What," retreating to abstract philosophy. He asks "What is truth?" while Truth Himself stands breathing before him. He waits for no answer, for the world despises the silence of God. Yet, even in his blindness, the governor is compelled to pronounce the verdict of the Lamb: *ego oudemia aitian heurisko*—"I find no fault." The sinless nature of Christ is ratified by the very authority that will condemn Him.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
εϲτιν δε ϲυνηθια ϋμιν · ϊ ενα απολυϲω ϋμιν εν τω παϲχα · βουλεϲθε ουν ϊνα απολυϲω ϋμιν τ βαϲιλεα των ϊου

**English Translation**
"But there is a custom for you, that I should release one to you in the Passover; do you wish therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate attempts to navigate between justice and the mob by invoking *synēthia* (custom). Note the irony of the season: it is the *Pascha*. The Jews prepare to eat the symbol of deliverance, yet they conspire to destroy the true Passover Lamb. Pilate uses the title "King of the Jews" (*basilea tōn iou*) not as a confession of faith, but as a political barb to shame the accusers. He offers them a choice, believing they will not reject their own titular monarch, but he underestimates the depth of their hatred for the Light.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
εκραυγαϲ ουν παλιν λεγον · μη τουτον · αλλα τον βαραββ · ην δε ο βαραββαϲ λη ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they cried out again saying: "Not this one, but Barabbas." Now Barabbas was a robber.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rejection is total. *Ekraugasan* implies a guttural scream, a violent clamor. They choose *Barabbas*—a name meaning "Son of the Father"—over the true Son of the Father. The Codex is stark in its description of the chosen one: *lē* (abbreviated for *lēstēs*). He is not merely a thief, but a brigand, a man of violence and insurrection. The world chooses the sword over the Word; they prefer the one who takes life (*lēstēs*) to the One who gives it. Thus, the innocent is bound that the guilty may go free—a grim parable of the atonement enacted in the courtyard of judgment.
