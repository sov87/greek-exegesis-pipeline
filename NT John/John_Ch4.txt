**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ ουν εγνω ο ο ηκουϲαν οι φα · οτι πλει μαθηταϲ ποι και βαπτιζει · η ϊω ·

**English Translation**
When therefore the [Lord] knew that the Pharisees heard that he makes more disciples and baptizes than John;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the omniscience of the Word; the text says simply *egnos* (he knew). The scribe writes the article `ο` twice, perhaps hesitating, yet pointing to the One who is the subject, the Lord himself. We see the rising tide of the New Covenant: the Pharisees (`οι φα`) are alerted because the Master now exceeds the Servant. John (`ϊω`) prepared the way, but the Bridegroom now gathers the assembly. The Lord withdraws not from fear, but to avoid premature confrontation with the envy of the Pharisees.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
καιτοιγε αυτοϲ · ουκ εβαπτιζ εβαπτιζ · αλλ οι μαθηται αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And yet he himself did not baptize [baptize], but his disciples;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A necessary distinction is made here by the Evangelist. The scribe’s hand stutters, writing `εβαπτιζ` twice, emphasizing the act which the Lord *did not* perform in the flesh with water. Why? Because He is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. To baptize with water is the work of servants; to baptize with fire and Spirit is the prerogative of the Master. He leaves the water-rite to the disciples, reserving the regeneration of the soul for his own divine power.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
αφηκεν τ τ ϊουδαιαν · και απηλ παλιν ειϲ τ τ γαλιλαιαν ·

**English Translation**
He left the [the] Judea and went away again into the [the] Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He departs from Judea, the seat of the Temple and the Pharisees, turning toward the Gentiles' border. The repetition of the article `τ` (the) before Judea and Galilee in the manuscript underscores the distinct separation of these regions. He goes "again" (`παλιν`), showing his persistence in illuminating the darker regions of the land. He flees glory to seek the humble, leaving the proud in Judea to find the simple in Galilee.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
εδει δε αυτον διερχεϲθαι δια τηϲ ϲαμαριαϲ

**English Translation**
But it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the word `εδει` (it was necessary). This was not merely a geographical necessity of the route, for one could bypass Samaria to avoid defilement, as many Jews did. It was a *theological* necessity. The Good Shepherd was compelled by his own mercy to seek the lost sheep in the midst of the Samaritans (`ϲαμαριαϲ`). Divine economy dictated this path; the salvation of the woman was the necessity that drove his steps.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
λε ερχεται ουν ειϲ πολιν τηϲ ϲαμαριαϲ λεγομενην ϲυχαρ · πληϲιον του χω ο εδωκεν ϊα τω ϊωϲηφ τω ϋϊω αυτου ·

**English Translation**
[He] comes therefore into a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground which Jacob gave to Joseph his son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text brings us to `ϲυχαρ`, rooting the Gospel in the soil of the Patriarchs. The scribe corrects `λε` (perhaps starting *legei*) to `ερχεται` (comes), showing the movement of God into history. We stand on the ground (`χω`) of Jacob (`ϊα`) and Joseph (`ϊωϲηφ`). The Old Testament types are converging: Joseph, the beloved son sent into a foreign land, prefigures Christ, the Beloved Son, coming now to a people estranged from the pure worship of Jerusalem.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ε πηγη του ϊακωβ · ο ουν κεκοπιακωϲ εκ τηϲ οδοιποριαϲ · εκαθεζετο ουτωϲ επι τη πηγη · ωρα ωϲ ωϲει ωϲ εκτη ·

**English Translation**
Now [there] was a spring of Jacob; the [Lord] therefore, having been wearied from the journey, was sitting thus by the spring; it was hour [as as-if as] sixth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the mystery of the Incarnation: the Creator of the ends of the earth is "wearied" (`κεκοπιακωϲ`). He sits "thus" (`ουτωϲ`)—simply, without pomp, upon the ground. The text struggles with the time, `ωρα ωϲ ωϲει ωϲ εκτη` (hour as... as if... sixth), placing us at high noon, the heat of the day. The True Source of Life sits beside the earthly spring (`πηγη`), thirsting in his humanity that he might quench our thirst with his divinity.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ερχεται τιϲ γυνη εκ τηϲ ϲαμα αντληϲαι · λεγει αυτη ο δοϲ μοι πιν πιειν ·

**English Translation**
Comes a certain woman of Samaria to draw [water]; the [Lord] says to her: Give me [to drink] to drink.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A woman comes, likely an outcast given the hour, for women usually drew water in the cool of the morning. The Lord initiates the covenant. The scribe corrects `πιν` to `πιειν`, emphasizing the act. "Give me to drink." He who spread out the seas asks for a drop of water. He humbles himself to become a beggar to the Samaritan (`ϲαμα`), that he might make her rich in grace. He thirsts for her faith more than for the water.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
οι γαρ μα αυτου απε ειϲ τ πολιν · ϊνα τροφαϲ αγοραϲωϲιν ·

**English Translation**
For his disciples had gone away into the city, that they might buy foods.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Providence arranges solitude. The disciples (`μα`) are occupied with the belly, seeking `τροφαϲ` (foods/nourishment). They leave the Word alone. This separation is necessary; had the disciples been present, perhaps the woman would not have approached, or the disciples would have rebuked her. The Physician meets the patient alone to dress the wound of her soul without shame.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ουν αυτω η γυνη η ϲα · πωϲ ϲυ ϊου ων · παρ εμου πιν πιειν αιτιϲ γυναικοϲ ϲαμαριτιδοϲ ουϲηϲ ου γαρ ϲυνχρωνται ϊουδαιοι ϲαμαρειταιϲ ‾‾

**English Translation**
Says therefore to him the Samaritan woman: How [do] you, being a Jew, ask from me [to drink] to drink, being a Samaritan woman? For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The woman recognizes the ethnic and religious chasm. She calls him a Jew (`ϊου`), seeing only the flesh. She marvels that he asks (`αιτιϲ`) for water, violating the custom of separation (`ου γαρ ϲυνχρωνται` - for they do not use together/associate). The scribe again corrects the word for drink (`πιν πιειν`). She sees the Law which divides; He sees the Grace which unites. She speaks of earthly regulations; He prepares to shatter the wall of partition.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ειπ αυτη · ει ηδιϲ την δω του · και τιϲ εϲτιν ο λεγων ϲοι δοϲ μοι πιν πιειν · ϲυ αν ητηϲαϲ αυτον · και εδωκεν αν ϲοι · υ ζων ·

**English Translation**
[He] answered and said to her: If you knew the gift of God, and who it is saying to you, Give me [to drink] to drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given to you living water.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the tragedy of ignorance: "If you knew" (`ει ηδιϲ`). The "gift of God" (`δω του`) stands before her, yet she sees only a thirsty traveler. He offers `υ ζων` (living water)—not merely running water from a spring, but the Spirit which creates life eternal. He inverts the relationship: she thinks He needs her water, but He reveals that she needs His. The beggar is the King.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυ εκεινη η γυνη · ουτε αντλημα εχειϲ · κ(αι) το φρεαρʼ εϲτιν βαθυ · ποθεν εχειϲ το ϋ το ζων ·

**English Translation**
Says to him that woman: Neither a bucket have you, and the well is deep; from where have you the water, the living [one]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She reasons with carnal logic. She looks at the visible tools: He has no `αντλημα` (bucket). She looks at the difficulty: the well is `βαθυ` (deep). How can he provide? She calls the water `ϋ` (abbreviated *hydor*). She mocks the impossibility, not understanding that the One speaking dug the deep places of the earth. She measures the depth of the pit but cannot measure the height of the Heavens standing before her.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
μη ϲυ μειζον μειζων ει του πα ημων ϊακωβ · οϲτιϲ εδωκεν ημ ημ το φρεαρ · αυτοϲ και και αυτοϲ και και αυτοϲ εξ αυτου επιεν · και οι υϊοι αυτου και τα θρεμματα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us [us] the well? He himself [and and he himself and and he himself] drank from it, and his sons and his livestock.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Samaritan claim to lineage is made bold: "our father Jacob" (`πα ημων ϊακωβ`). The scribe struggles mightily here, writing `αυτοϲ και και αυτοϲ...` repeatedly, as if stuttering over the comparison. She compares the Stranger to the Patriarch who provided water for sons and cattle (`θρεμματα`). She asks, "Are you greater?" (`μειζων`). The answer is the pivot of the Gospel. Jacob gave water that sustains for a day; this Man gives water that sustains forever. Jacob drank and died; who drinks from Christ lives.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ει αυτη · παϲ ο πι εκ του ϋδατοϲ τουτου · διψηϲει παλ παλ

**English Translation**
He answered and said to her: Everyone drinking of this water shall thirst again [again].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the futility of the earthly element. The Lord speaks not merely of the well of Jacob, but of the cisterns of the world. The repetition in the Codex—*palin palin* (again again)—though perhaps a scribal emphasis, serves us well doctrinally: it underscores the ceaseless, recurring cycle of carnal desire. Drink of the world, and you are doomed to a perpetual return to the source of your dissatisfaction.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ο δε πινων οϲ δ αν πιη εκ του ϋδατοϲ ου εγω δωϲω αυτω · ου μη διψηϲει ειϲ τον αιωνα · αλ το ϋδωρʼ ο εγω δω γενηϲεται εν αυ πηγη ϋδατοϲ αλλομενου · ειϲ ζω αιωνιον ·

**English Translation**
But the one drinking, whoever drinks of the water which I will give him, shall by no means thirst into the age; but the water which I give shall become in him a spring of water leaping up into life eternal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great contrast. The earthly water is static and external; the grace of Christ is internal and dynamic. The word *allomenou* (leaping or springing) signifies the vigor of the Holy Spirit, who does not stagnate within the believer but leaps upward, defying the gravity of sin, propelling the soul toward its eternal source. It is a fountain that originates in God and returns to God.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
λεγει προϲ αυτον η γυνη · · δοϲ μοι τουτο το ϋδωρ · ϊνα μη δει · μηδε διερχω ωδε ερχομαι ενθαδε αντλειν ·

**English Translation**
The woman says to him: Give me this water, that I might not thirst, nor pass through here [or come here] to draw.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The woman remains trapped in the literal. She desires the gift only to alleviate the burden of her labor—the toil of the journey and the weight of the jar. She seeks ease for the flesh, while the Lord offers life to the spirit. The scribal variance here—vacillating between *dierchomai* (pass through) and *erchomai* (come)—reflects her confusion: she wishes to cease the journey entirely, not understanding that the true journey is inward.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη ο καλ ϋ φωνηϲον τον ανδρα ϲου και ελθε ενθαδε ·

**English Translation**
He says to her: [Go] call your husband and come here.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Before the living water can be poured out, the vessel must be inspected for cracks. The Lord abruptly shifts from the promise of grace to the command of law. He touches the wound of her conscience. One cannot receive the spiritual mystery without first confronting the moral reality of one's life. The hidden things must be brought "here," into the light of His presence.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
απε η γυνη κ(αι) ειπεν αν ουκ εχω · λεγει αυτη ο καλωϲ ει · οτι ανδρα ουκ ε ·

**English Translation**
The woman answered and said: I do not have a husband. He says to her: You said well, that "I do not have a husband."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She speaks the truth, yet she seeks to hide the fullness of it. It is a confession by omission. The Lord, the Searcher of Hearts, accepts the fragment of truth she offers—"You said well"—turning her defense into a testimony. He does not rebuke her immediately but validates her admission to prepare her for the full revelation of her state.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
πεντε γαρ ανδραϲ εϲχεϲ · και νυν ον εχιϲ ουκ εϲτιν ϲου ανηρ · τουτο αλη ειρηκαϲ ·

**English Translation**
For you had five husbands, and now the one you have is not your husband; this you have spoken true.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The number five is significant. It may represent the five senses of the body by which she has lived carnally, or the five books of the Law of Moses which the Samaritans accepted but which could not marry the soul to God. Her current state is illicit; she is bound to no covenant. The Lord exposes the disorder of her life not to condemn, but to show that He knows her fully, a prerequisite for her salvation.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω η γυνη θεω οτι προφητηϲ ει ϲυ ·

**English Translation**
The woman says to him: I perceive that you are a prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The revelation of her secret life opens her eyes. She no longer sees a weary Jewish traveler, but a *Prophetes*—one who speaks for God. This is the first step of faith: acknowledging the divine authority of the Messenger. She moves from mocking the water to respecting the source.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
οι πατερεϲ ημ εν τω ορι τουτω προϲεκυνηϲαν · και ϋμειϲ λεγεται οτι εν ϊεροϲολυ εϲτιν · οπου προϲκυνιν δει

**English Translation**
Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and you [plural] say that in Jerusalem is [the place] where it is necessary to worship.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Finding her conscience pricked, she attempts to retreat into theological controversy—a common tactic of the sinner avoiding repentance. She raises the schism between Gerizim ("this mountain") and Jerusalem. She asks about the *place* of worship to avoid the *state* of the worshiper. She seeks a map; Christ brings a mirror.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη ο · πι μοι γυναι · ο ερχεται ωρα · οτε ουτε εν τω ορει του ουτε εν ϊεροϲο προϲκυνη τω πατρι ·

**English Translation**
He says to her: Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord dismantles the geography of religion. He introduces a new name: *The Father*. Worship is no longer about the altitude of the mountain or the stones of the temple, but about the relationship of the child to the Father. The "hour" of the New Covenant renders the old debates of place obsolete.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ϋμιϲ προϲκυνειτε ο ουκ οιδατε · ημιϲ προϲκυνουμεν ο οιδαμεν · οτι η ϲω εκ των ϊου εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know; because salvation is from the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Charity does not deny truth. The Bishop must affirm that the Samaritans, by rejecting the Prophets, worship in ignorance. They possess zeal without knowledge. The Jews, possessing the oracles, "know" what they worship. Salvation moves historically through the line of Judah; Christ does not deny his lineage, for the Root must be Jewish even if the Branches cover the earth.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
αλλα ερχεται ωρα και ν ν εϲτιν · οτε οι αληθι προϲκυνηται προϲκυνηϲουϲιν τω πατρι · εν και αληθεια · και γαρ ο πατηρ τοιουτουϲ ζη τουϲ προϲκυνο αυτω αυτον ·

**English Translation**
But an hour is coming and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in [Spirit] and truth; for indeed the Father seeks such ones worshipping him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The shadows flee. The "true worshipers" are not defined by blood or location, but by *Pneuma* (Spirit) and *Aletheia* (Truth). The text here emphasizes the Father's active seeking. God is not a passive idol waiting on a hill; He is the Hunter of Souls, seeking those who will offer Him the spiritual sacrifice of a contrite and illuminated heart.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
π ο · και τουϲ προϲκυ αυτον εν α και αληθεια προϲκυν δει δει προϲκυνιν ·

**English Translation**
Spirit is God; and those worshipping him must worship in [Spirit] and truth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe abbreviates the highest theology: *Pneuma ho Theos*. God is not body, not location, not material. He is Spirit. Therefore, the liturgy of the church must correspond to His nature. We cannot worship the Invisible with mere visible rites; the external act is dead without the internal reality of the Spirit and the doctrinal integrity of the Truth. The double "dei" (must/necessary) in the manuscript reinforces the absolute necessity of this new mode of adoration.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω η γυ · οιδα οιδαμεν οτι μεϲϲι ερχεται ο λεγομε · οταν ελθη · εκεινοϲ αναγγελ αναγγελαι ημιν απαντα ˙

**English Translation**
The woman says to him: I know [we know] that Messias is coming, the [one] called...; when that one comes, he will announce [announce] to us all things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s hesitation in *oida oidamen* (I know / we know). It reflects the woman’s state: she speaks first from personal conviction ("I know"), then corrects herself to speak for her people ("we know"). Even the Samaritans, separated from the Temple, possess the seed of hope. She awaits the *Messias*—spelled here with the double sigma, emphasizing the Hebrew title—not merely as a king, but as a revealer. She looks for *hapanta* (all things) to be made clear. The stutter in *anaggel anaggelai* (announce) underscores the urgency of this expected revelation.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη ο εγω ειμι ο λαλων ϲοι ·

**English Translation**
[He] says to her: I am [he], the [one] speaking to thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the unveiled Majesty. The Lord uses the divine self-identification: *Ego eimi* (I am). He does not add "the Christ" in the text, though it is implied; the "I Am" suffices. It is the voice of the Burning Bush speaking to a sinner at a well. The intimacy is terrifying and tender: the Creator is *ho lalon soi* (the one speaking to thee). He bypasses the priests and the mountains to reveal Himself directly to the humble heart.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και εν επι τουτω επηλ ηλθον οι μαθηται αυ · και εθαυμαζ εθαυμαζ οτι μετα γυναικοϲ ελαλει · ουδειϲ μεν ειπεν αυτω · τι ζητιϲ · η τι λαλειϲ μετ αυτηϲ ·

**English Translation**
And upon this came [came] his disciples; and they marveled [marveled] that with a woman he was speaking; yet no one said to him: What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text exhibits a trembling hand—*epel elthon* and *ethaumaz ethaumaz*—as if the scribe himself stammers at the disciples' shock. They marvel that the Word converses with a woman, violating the customs of the rabbis. Yet, notice the authority of the Lord: though they are confused, fear binds their tongues. They dare not interrogate God. *Ti zetis* (what seekest thou) remains unasked, for his seeking is beyond human comprehension—He seeks the lost sheep.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
αφηκ ουν την ϋδριαν αυτηϲ η γυνη · και απηλθεν ειϲ την πολιν · και λεγει τοιϲ ανθρωποιϲ

**English Translation**
Therefore the woman left her water-jar, and went away into the city, and says to the men:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery: she leaves the *hydrian* (water-jar). She came for earthly water, but having tasted the Living Water, she abandons the vessel of clay. She no longer needs the heavy burden of the law or the labor of the flesh. She goes to the *anthropois* (men)—those she previously avoided in the heat of the day due to her shame—now emboldened by the presence of the Christ to become an apostle to her own city.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
δευ ϊδετε ανθρωπ · οϲ ειπε ειπεν μοι παντα α εποιηϲα · μητι ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο ·

**English Translation**
Come, see a man who said [said] to me all things whatever I did; is this not the [Christ]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
She invites them to *idete* (see). Faith comes by hearing, but confirmation by sight. Her testimony rests on His omniscience: He told her *panta* (all things) she did in secret. The verse ends abruptly in this Codex with *estin o* (is the...). The title "Christ" is cut off or implied, perhaps too holy to be fully written, or indicating that the question hangs in the air, awaiting the people's verdict. She proposes the truth as a question to disarm their pride.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθον ουν εκ τηϲ πολεωϲ · και ηρχοντο προϲ αυ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they went out from the city, and were coming to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The effect of the word is immediate. *Exelthon* (they went out). To find Christ, one must often go out from the "city"—the place of worldly comfort, noise, and sin. They were *erchonto* (coming) to Him; the imperfect tense suggests a continuous stream of people flowing toward the Wellspring of Life.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
εν τω μεταξυ ηρωτων αυτον οι μαθηται λεγον · ραββει φαγε ˙

**English Translation**
In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying: Rabbi, eat.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples, still earthbound, address Him as *Rabbei* (Teacher) but treat Him as a dependent. They offer Him earthly bread, unaware that He is the Bread of Life. There is a stark contrast between the woman, who left her water-jar to preach, and the disciples, who press Him to satisfy the flesh.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ειπεν αυτοιϲ ε βρωϲιν εχω φαγιν · ην ου οιδατε ·

**English Translation**
But he said to them: I have food to eat, which [ye] know not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks of a secret sustenance. The text reads *e brosin*—likely a contraction for *Ego* (I) or an emphatic particle. He possesses a nourishment *hen ou oidate* (which ye know not). The natural man does not understand the things of the Spirit. His hunger is for the salvation of the Samaritans; His feast is the conversion of souls.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
λεγουϲ ελεγον ο οι μαθηται προϲ αλληλουϲ · μη τιϲ ηνεγκεν αυτω φαγειν ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the disciples said [said] to one another: Hath anyone brought him [anything] to eat?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The duplication *legous elegon* (saying said) and *o oi* (the the) mirrors the murmuring confusion of the disciples. They look horizontally ("to one another") rather than vertically. They suspect a secret courier brought bread. They interpret the spiritual strictly through the carnal, a persistent blindness that the Lord must constantly heal.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτοιϲ ο εμον βρωμα εϲτιν · ϊνα ποιω το θελημα του πεμ με και τε αυτου το εργον

**English Translation**
[Jesus] says to them: My food is that I should do the will of the [one] sending me and finish his work.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the definition of divine food: obedience. *Broma* is not matter, but act. The abbreviated *pem* (for *pempsantos*, sending) and *te* (for *teleioso*, finish/perfect) in the manuscript give the text a rushing quality. The Son is consumed with the desire to perfect the work of the Father. To save the lost is what sustains the life of the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ουχ υμιϲ λεγεται · οτι ετι τε εϲτιν · και ο θεριϲμοϲ ερ · ϊδου λεγω ϋ επαρατε τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ ϋ και θεαϲαϲθε ταϲ χωραϲ · οτι λευ ειϲιν · προϲ θε · ηδη

**English Translation**
Say ye not that there is yet [four months], and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and gaze at the fields, for they are white to harvest already.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe heavily abbreviates: *te* (four months), *er* (comes), *leu* (white), *the* (harvest). This compression fits the urgency of the message. The Lord rebukes the procrastination of the natural eye. Men say "wait," God says "look." The fields are *leukai* (white)—perhaps alluding to the white garments of the approaching Samaritans. The harvest is not a future hope but a present reality (*ede*). The time for gathering is now.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ο θε μιϲθον λαμ · και ϲυναγι καρπον ειϲ ζωην αιωνιον · ϊνα και ο ϲπιρων ομου χαιρη · και ο θερι ·

**English Translation**
The reaper receives wages, and gathers fruit unto life eternal; that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text distinguishes the *speiron* (sower) from the *theri* (reaper), yet unites them in joy. The Prophets and Patriarchs sowed in tears; the Apostles and the Lord now reap in joy. The wage is not silver, but *karpon eis zoen aionion* (fruit unto eternal life). The abrupt ending on *theri* (reaper) leaves the action open-ended: the reaping continues through the Church until the end of the age.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
εν γαρ τουτω ο λογοϲ εϲτιν ο α · οτι αλλοϲ εϲτιν ο ϲπιρων · κ(αι) αλλοϲ ο θεριζων ·

**English Translation**
For in this the word is true: that one is the sower, and another the reaper.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Lord confirms the proverb (*logos*) of the ancients, sanctifying human wisdom to explain divine economy. We see the distinction of offices within the unity of the harvest. The *spirōn* (sower) refers to the Patriarchs and Prophets who toiled in the hard ground of the Law; the *therizōn* (reaper) refers to the Apostles. Yet, observe the singularity of the operation: though the hands differ, the crop—the salvation of souls—is one.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
εγω απεϲταλκα ϋμαϲ θεριζειν · ο ουχ ϋμειϲ κεκο · αλλοι κε και ϋμειϲ ειϲ τον κο αυτων ειϲε ·

**English Translation**
I sent you to reap that for which you have not [labored]; others [labored], and you have entered into their [labor].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is compressed, the scribe abbreviating the labor (*kekopiakate*) and the toil (*kopon*), yet the burden of the meaning remains heavy. Christ establishes the hierarchy of grace: the Apostles enter (*eiselēlythate*) into a field already tilled by the sweat of the Prophets. It is a lesson in humility for the priesthood; we do not generate the fruit, but merely gather what the Spirit and the forefathers have prepared.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
εκ δε τηϲ πολεωϲ εκινηϲ πολλοι ε ειϲ αυτον · των ϲαμαριτων · δια τον λογον τηϲ γυ · μαρτυρου οτι ειπε ειπεν μοι παντα α εποιηϲα ·

**English Translation**
And from that city many believed in him, of the Samaritans, because of the word of the woman testifying: He told me all things I did.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the power of confession. The woman, marked by the abbreviation *gy* (gynaikos), becomes the apostle to the Samaritans. Her testimony is not of doctrine, but of exposure: "He told me all things I did." The Lord conquers the city not by sword, but by the revelation of the hidden heart. The scribe’s stutter (*eipe eipen*) emphasizes the repeated telling of this miracle of omniscience.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ ουν ηλθον προϲ αυτον οι ϲαμαρι · ηρωτων αυτ μειναι παρ αυτοιϲ · και εμινεν παρ αυ ημεραϲ δυο ·

**English Translation**
When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them; and he remained with them two days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A marvel! The Jews drive Him out, but the *Samari* (Samaritans) beg Him to remain (*meinai*). He grants them two days—a mystical number, perhaps signifying the two commandments of love, or the time allotted to the Gentiles before the final consummation. He abides where He is welcomed, showing that the Kingdom is not of bloodline but of reception.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
και πολλω πλειουϲ επιϲτευϲαν δια τον λογον αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And many more believed because of his word.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the progression of faith. First, they believed through the woman's report; now, *pleious* (more) believe through *ton logon autou* (His own word). The sheep recognize the Shepherd's voice directly. The intermediary serves to introduce, but the Word Himself secures the soul.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και ελεγον τη γυ τη τε γυναικι ελεγον οτι ουκετι δια την ϲην μαρτυ λαλιαν πιϲτευομ πιϲτευομ · αυτοι γαρ ακηκοα παρ αυτου · και οιδαμεν οτι αλη ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο ϲ του κοϲμου ·

**English Translation**
And they said to the woman: No longer because of your [speech] do we believe; for we ourselves have heard from him, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reveals a struggle in the text—*marty* (witness) is corrected to *lalian* (speech/chatter)—suggesting the Samaritans distinguish between the woman's chatter and the Lord's truth. They arrive at the highest Christological confession: He is the *S* (Sōtēr/Savior) not of the Jews only, but *tou kosmou* (of the world). This universal title is found in the mouth of foreigners, shaming the exclusivity of the Synagogue.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
μετα δε ταϲ δυο η · εξηλθεν εκειθεν · ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν ·

**English Translation**
And after the two days, he went forth from there into Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine itinerary resumes. Having sown the seed among the heterodox during the "two days," He returns to the orthodox lands of Galilee. He does not rest in his success but moves constantly, driven by the Spirit to confront his own people.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ γαρ εμαρτυρη · οτι προφητηϲ εν τη ϊδια πατριδι · τιμην ουκ εχει ·

**English Translation**
For he himself testified that a prophet in his own fatherland has no honor.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A paradox. He goes to Galilee *because* a prophet has no honor there? Or does He go despite it? It seems He seeks the harder soil. The *idia patridi* (own fatherland) is the place of familiarity, which breeds contempt. Where the Samaritans saw a Savior, his neighbors see only the carpenter's son. He testifies to this hardness of heart to warn us against taking holy things for granted.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ οτε ουν ηλθεν ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν εδεξαντο αυτον οι γαλιλαιοι παντα οι εωρακοτεϲ π εωρακοτεϲ α οϲα εποιηϲεν εν ϊ εν τη εορτη · και αυτοι γαρ εληλυθιϲαν ειϲ την εορτην ·

**English Translation**
When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves also had gone to the feast.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Galileans receive Him, but their faith is defective compared to the Samaritans. The Samaritans believed the *word*; the Galileans believe because they are *eōrakotes* (having seen) the signs in Jerusalem (*Hierosolymois*). Their faith rests on the visual spectacle of the feast (*eortē*), not the internal conviction of the truth. The scribe’s repetition of "seen" underlines their reliance on the eyes of the flesh.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ηλθαν ουν παλ παλ ειϲ την καναν κανα κανα τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ οπου εποιηϲαν εποιηϲεν το οινον · ην δε τιϲ βαϲιλικοϲ ου ο υϊοϲ ηϲθενι · εν καφαρναουμʼ

**English Translation**
He came therefore again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son was sick in Capernaum.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stammers over the location (*Kanan Kana Kana*), as if trembling at the site of the first miracle. He returns to Cana, the place of transformation. A *basilikos* (royal official) approaches—sickness (*ēstheni*) respects no rank. The geography is spiritual: the official must leave the comfort of Capernaum to find the Lord in the humble village of Cana.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ ακουϲαϲ οτι ο ο η εκ τηϲ ειϲ την γαλιλαι ηλθεν ουν απηλθεν προϲ αυτον και ηρωτα καταβη · και ϊα αυτου τον · ημελλε ημελλεν γαρ απο ·

**English Translation**
This man, hearing that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went away to him and asked him to come down and heal his son; for he was about to die.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is fragmented, mirroring the father's distress. He begs Jesus to *katabē* (come down). His faith is imperfect; he believes Jesus can heal, but only if He is physically present. He limits the Divine power to proximity. The threat of death (*apothnēskein*) drives him, but his theology is still bound by space and time.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν ο προϲ αυτον · εαν μη ϲη και τερατα ϊδη ου μη πιϲτευϲη ·

**English Translation**
Therefore Jesus said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A severe rebuke. The Lord addresses not just the man, but the whole people (indicated by the plural *idēte* implied in the context of the Galileans). They crave *sē* (sēmeia/signs) and *terata* (wonders). This contrasts sharply with the Samaritans who believed without seeing miracles. True faith trusts the Word alone; weak faith demands a spectacle. Christ refuses to be a mere wonder-worker; He demands the obedience of faith.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
λεγει προϲ αυτ ο βαϲιλικοϲ · κα πριν απο τον παιδα μου ˙

**English Translation**
The royal official says to him: [Come down] before my child [dies].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the desperation of the dignitary, here stripped of his titles and reduced to a pleading father. The text presents a hurried, breathless cry; the abbreviated forms `κα` (for *katabēthi*, come down) and `απο` (for *apothanein*, to die) in the manuscript mirror the urgency of a man who believes death is faster than the Lord’s feet. He calls his son `παιδα` (servant/child), a term of tender endearment or perhaps indicating a young age. He limits the Christ, imagining He must physically descend (`κα`) to the bedside to effect a cure, not yet knowing that the Word traverses space instantly.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ο · πο · ο ϲου ζη · επιϲτευϲεν ο αν τω λογω του ον ειπεν αυτω και επορευε ·

**English Translation**
He says to him: Go; your [son] lives. The man believed the word [which] he spoke to him and was journeying.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord’s response is sharp and sovereign: `πο` (Go!). He does not descend physically but sends His power. The text reads `ο ϲου ζη` (yours lives), omitting the noun, focusing entirely on the existence of the beloved one. Mark the transformation of the `αν` (man): he ceases to be merely a royal official and becomes a believer. He accepts the bare `λογω` (word) without a visible sign. The verb `επορευε` (was journeying) indicates that his faith was immediately put into motion; he walked upon the promise before he saw the proof.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
ηδη δε αυτου καταβαινοντοϲ · οι δουλοι ϋπηντη αυτω · και ηγ · οτι ο παιϲ αυτου ζη ·

**English Translation**
And already as he was going down, the slaves met him, and [announced] that his child lives.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While the father is in the act of `καταβαινοντοϲ` (going down)—an act of obedience to the command "Go"—the miracle meets him halfway. The slaves bring the announcement (`ηγ`, likely *ēggeilan*) using the same term `παιϲ` (child). The confirmation of life comes not when he arrives at the house, but when he is on the road of trust. The divine work was finished the moment the Word was spoken, but the human realization occurs in the descent of faith.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
επυθετο ουν την ωραν πα αυτων εν η κομ εϲχεν · και ειπον αυτω · οτι εχθεϲ ωραν εβδο αφηκεν αυτ ο πυρετοϲ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore he inquired from them the hour in which he had [improvement]; and they said to him that yesterday [at the] seventh hour the fever left him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The father seeks to correlate the divine word with temporal reality. He asks when the boy `κομ εϲχεν` (had it better/improved). The servants reply with precision: `ωραν εβδο` (the seventh hour). The fever did not merely subside gradually; it `αφηκεν` (left/forgave) him. The disease is treated as a hostile entity that was dismissed by a superior command. The "seventh hour" suggests a time of completion and rest, signifying the perfection of the Lord's work even from a distance.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
εγνω ουν ο πατηρʼ οτι ε εν εκεινη τη ωρα εν η ειπεν αυτω ο ο ϋϊοϲ ϲου ζη και επιϲτευ αυτοϲ και η οικι αυτου ολη ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the father knew that [it was] in that hour in which He said to him: Your son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here `ο πατηρ` (the father) attains full knowledge (`εγνω`). The physical healing of the `ϋϊοϲ` (son) leads to the spiritual healing of the `οικι` (house). The text emphasizes `ολη` (whole)—the salvation is corporate, spreading from the head of the house to all its members. The miracle is no longer just about a fever leaving, but about faith entering. The synchronization of the "hour" proves that the Lord's will is the master of time and space.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
τουτο παλιν δευτερον εποιηϲεν ϲημι ϲημι ο ελθων εκ τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν

**English Translation**
This again a second [time] he did [as] a sign, a sign, having come out of Judea into Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe here repeats `ϲημι` (sign) twice—`ϲημι ϲημι`—perhaps an error of the hand, yet to the spiritual eye, it emphasizes the magnitude of the event. It is a "sign of signs." This second wonder marks His transition `εκ τηϲ ϊουδαιαϲ` (out of Judea) into the Gentile-adjacent Galilee. As the first sign (water to wine) sanctified the joy of life, this second sign (healing from death) sanctifies the sorrow of life, proving the Christ is Lord over both festivity and fever.
