**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα λελαληκεν · και επαραϲ τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ αυ ειϲ τον ουρα ειπεν ˙ πατερ . εληλυθεν η ωρα · δοξαϲον ϲου τον · ϊνα ο δοξαϲη ϲε ·

**English Translation**
These things he has spoken; and having lifted up his eyes into the heaven he said: Father, the hour has come; glorify your [Son]; that the [Son] may glorify you;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the posture of the Lord. He lifts his eyes `ειϲ τον ουρα` (into the heaven), teaching us that prayer requires the elevation of the mind from earthly cares. The scribe here writes `τον` (the) without the noun *Son*, and again `ο` (the) without the noun. This silence is profound; the Article alone suffices for the Only-Begotten. He needs no title to be recognized by the Father. The "hour" (`η ωρα`) is not merely of death, but of the completion of the economy of salvation. The glorification is reciprocal—the Father glorifies the Son in the Resurrection, and the Son glorifies the Father by revealing His power over death.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
καθωϲ εδωκαϲ αυτω εξουϲιαν πα ϲαρκοϲ · ϊνα παν ο δεδωκαϲ αυ δωϲω δωϲη αυτω αυτοιϲ ζωην αιωνιον :

**English Translation**
Just as you gave him authority of all flesh; that all which you have given to him, he shall give [might give] to him [to them] eternal life.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the manuscript reveals the struggle of the human hand to capture divine intent. We see `δωϲω δωϲη` (I shall give / he might give) and `αυτω αυτοιϲ` (to him / to them). The scribe wavers, yet the truth stands: The authority extends over `πα ϲαρκοϲ` (all flesh), not merely the Jews. The gift is `ζωην αιωνιον` (eternal life). Note that the Son does not seize this authority; it is given (`εδωκαϲ`) by the Father, preserving the monarchy of the Godhead while establishing the equality of power. The confusion of pronouns—"to him" corrected to "to them"—reminds us that the Body of Christ is one; what is given to the Head is given to the members.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
αυτη δε εϲτιν η αι ζωη · γινωϲκωϲι ϲε · τον μονον αληθι . και ον α ˙

**English Translation**
And this is the eternal life: that they might know you, the only true [God], and whom [you sent]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The definition of life is knowledge (`γινωϲκωϲι`). Not speculative philosophy, but relational intimacy. The text is starkly abbreviated: `αληθι` for *alethinon* (true) and `ον α` where the verb *apesteilas* (sent) is reduced to a single alpha. This haste signifies the urgency of the confession. We confess the Father as `τον μονον` (the only one) to exclude polytheism, yet we immediately join the Son to Him. The text breaks off, as if the mystery of the "Sent One" is too vast for the parchment. To know the Sender is to know the Sent; they cannot be severed.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ε ϲε εδοξαϲα ε τηϲ γηϲ · το εργ τελιωϲαϲ ο δεδω με μοι · ϊνα ποιη ˙

**English Translation**
I glorified you on the earth; having perfected the work which you have given me [to me]; that I should do [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks from the vantage of the accomplished cross, though he yet stands before it. `τελιωϲαϲ` (having perfected/finished)—the work is done in will and intent. The scribe writes `με μοι` (me / to me), a stutter that emphasizes the personal reception of the divine commission. The Son does not act on his own initiative, but fulfills what was given. The phrase `ε τηϲ γηϲ` (on the earth) contrasts with the glory he had in heaven; he brought the liturgy of heaven down to the dust of Adam.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και νυν δοξα με ϲυ πατερʼ παρα ϲεαυτω · τη δο ην η η ειχον · προ του τον κοϲμον ειναι παρα ϲοι ·

**English Translation**
And now glorify me, You Father, with yourself; with the glory which I was having before the world was, with you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A hammer blow against the Arians! He says `ειχον` (I was having) `προ του τον κοϲμον ειναι` (before the world was). He did not come into existence at his birth in Bethlehem, nor was he created. He possessed glory `παρα ϲοι` (with You) in the timeless eternity. The scribe stammers `η η` (which, which), overwhelmed perhaps by the pre-existence of the Logos. He asks to be glorified not with a new glory, but with his own natural right, now taking his human nature into that pre-existent radiance.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ε ϲου το ονομα τοιϲ ανθρω · ουϲ εδωκαϲ μοι εκ του κοϲμου · ϲοι ηϲαν · και εμοι αυτουϲ εδωκαϲ · και τον λογον ϲου ετηρηϲαν ·

**English Translation**
[I manifested] your name to the men; whom you gave to me out of the world; yours they were; and to me you gave them; and your word they have kept.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verb is truncated to `ε` (likely *ephanerosa*), but the action is clear: the revelation of the Name. Note the order of possession: `ϲοι ηϲαν` (Yours they were). The elect belong first to the Father by right of creation and foreknowledge, and are given (`εδωκαϲ`) to the Son for redemption. This is the great exchange of the Covenant. To "keep the word" (`λογον... ετηρηϲαν`) is the mark of the true disciple; it is not merely to hear, but to guard the deposit of faith against the corruption of the world.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
νυν ε · οτι παντα οϲα δεδωκαϲ μοι · παρα ϲου ειϲιν ˙

**English Translation**
Now [they have known]; that all things as many as you have given to me; are from you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads `νυν ε`—likely *nun egnokan* (now they have known). The disciples have finally pierced the veil. They understand that the Son is not a rival god, nor a separate power. `παντα οϲα` (all things whatsoever)—miracles, teachings, authority—are `παρα ϲου` (from You, the Father). This establishes the unity of operation in the Trinity. The Son does nothing of Himself that does not originate in the Father's will.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ο τα ρηματα · ἁ δε μοι · δεδω αυτοιϲ · και αυ ελαβον κ(αι) εγνωϲαν αλη · οτι παρα ϲου εξηλθον και ε επιϲτευϲαν · οτι ϲυ με απεϲτιλαϲ ·

**English Translation**
For the words; which [you gave] to me; I have given to them; and they received and knew truly; that from you I came out and they believed; that you sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is a distinction here between `λογον` (Word) in verse 6 and `ρηματα` (utterances/sayings) here. The specific teachings have been transmitted. The scribe abbreviates `αλη` for *alethos* (truly). True knowledge is linked to the confession of the Son's origin: `παρα ϲου εξηλθον` (I came out from you). This is the generation of the Son. The disciples' faith is grounded in the recognition of this divine mission. They received (`ελαβον`)—faith is an active reception of a gift offered.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ε περι αυτων ε · ου περι του κοϲμου ερωτω · αλλα περι ων δεδω μοι · οτι ϲοι ει ·

**English Translation**
I ask concerning them; not concerning the world do I ask; but concerning those whom you have given to me; because yours they are.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful distinction! The High Priest intercedes `ου περι του κοϲμου` (not concerning the world). The "world" here is the system of rebellion organized against God. The prayer is exclusive, a wall of fire around the elect (`περι ων δεδω μοι`). The reason for this protection is simple ownership: `οτι ϲοι ει` (because they are Yours). The Father loves them because they belong to Him, and the Son prays for them because they are the Father's property entrusted to His care.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και εμοι αυτουϲ εδωκαϲ · και δεδο εν αυτοιϲ ·

**English Translation**
And to me you gave them; and I have been glorified in them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Our Codex Sinaiticus presents a shorter, sharper reading here than other texts. It omits the reciprocal "all mine are yours," focusing entirely on the gift of the believers to the Son: `και εμοι αυτουϲ εδωκαϲ` (and to me you gave them). The glory of the Son is not just in the heavens, but `εν αυτοιϲ` (in them)—in the earthen vessels of the Apostles. When a Christian suffers or loves, Christ is glorified. We are the mirrors of His radiance.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
και ουκετι ειμι εν τω κοϲμω · και αυ εν τω κοϲμω ειϲιν · καγω προϲ ϲε ερχομαι · πατερ αγιε · τηρηϲον αυτουϲ εν τω ονοματι ϲου · ω εδωκαϲ μοι · ϊ ωϲιν ἑν · καθωϲ ημειϲ ·

**English Translation**
And no longer am I in the world; and they are in the world; and I come to you; Holy Father; keep them in your name; which you have given to me; that they may be one; just as we [are].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks as one already departing: `ουκετι ειμι` (no longer am I). He leaves the disciples in the combat zone while He ascends. The invocation `πατερ αγιε` (Holy Father) appeals to the divine nature that sets them apart. The reading `ω εδωκαϲ μοι` (which you gave me) refers to the *Name*, not the men (which would be *hous*). The Son was given the Name of God—the power and essence. The purpose of this keeping is `ϊ ωϲιν ἑν` (that they may be one). This unity is not organizational, but ontological, modeled on the Trinity: `καθωϲ ημειϲ` (just as We). As the Father and Son are one in essence, the Church must be one in love and truth.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
οτε ημην μετ αυτων · εγω ε αυτουϲ εν τω ονοματι κ ϲου ο δεδωκαϲ μοι και εφυλαϲϲον εφυλαξα και ουδιϲ εξ αυτ απωλετο · ει μη ο τηϲ απωλιαϲ · ϊνα η γραφη πληρωθη ·

**English Translation**
When I was with them; I [kept] them in your name [and?] which you have given to me and I was guarding [I guarded]; and no one of them perished; except the [son] of destruction; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Shepherd recounts his watch. `εφυλαϲϲον εφυλαξα`—the scribe writes both the imperfect (I was guarding) and the aorist (I guarded), capturing both the continuous care and the completed act. He kept them in the Name given to Him. The tragedy of Judas, `ο τηϲ απωλιαϲ` (the [son] of destruction), is not a failure of the Shepherd, but a fulfillment of `η γραφη` (the scripture). Even the loss of the traitor falls within the sovereign plan of God. The Son renders his account to the Father: the flock is safe, save the one who was destined for the pit, that the Word might stand true.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
νυν δε προϲ ϲε ερ · και ταυτα λα εν τω κοϲμω · εχωϲιν την χαραν την εμην . πεπληρωκενην πεπληρωμενην εν αυτοιϲ εαυτοιϲ ˙

**English Translation**
But now to you I come [erchomai]; and these things I speak [lalō] in the world; [that] they might have the joy that is mine, having been fulfilled [corrected: being filled up] in them [corrected: in themselves].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the urgency in the Lord’s movement: "to You I come." He speaks these mysteries while still in the flesh ("in the world") so that the sound of His voice might anchor the disciples. The scribe here struggles with the nature of this joy, correcting *peplērōkenēn* (active/perfect) to *peplērōmenēn* (passive), and *autois* (them) to *heautois* (themselves). This is doctrinally vital: the joy is not achieved by the disciples' effort, but is poured into them passively by grace, yet it must be internalized deeply within their own souls (*heautois*). It is Christ’s own joy, transplanted into the earthen vessels of men.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
εγω δε αυτοιϲ τον λο ϲου · και ο κο εμιϲηϲεν αυτουϲ · οτι ουκ ει εκ του κοϲμου · καθωϲ εγω ουκ ειμι εκ του κοϲμου ·

**English Translation**
I [gave] to them the word [logon] of yours; and the world [kosmos] hated them; because they are not of the world; just as I am not of the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is abbreviated, the scribe rushing under the weight of the Spirit. "I [gave]" is implied by the grammar of the gift. The reception of the Father's Logos creates an immediate ontological schism. The world (*kosmos*) hates them not for their moral failures, but for their alien nature. By receiving the Word, the disciples have changed their lineage; they are no longer "from" the world, just as the Son is eternally not "from" the earth. Their alienation is the proof of their adoption.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ουκ ε αρηϲ αυ εκ του κοϲμου . αλλ ϊνα τηρηϲηϲ αυ εκ του πονη ·

**English Translation**
I do not ask [erōtō] that you take them [autous] out of the world, but that you keep them [autous] from the evil [one/thing].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the paradox of our militant existence. We are not Gnostics, seeking to escape the material realm, nor are we of the world. The Lord prays not for our evacuation, but for our preservation. The "evil" (*ponērou*) is singular—the Adversary. We remain in the theater of war, the cosmos, but we are shielded by the Father’s hand. To be "kept" is not to be removed from danger, but to be sustained within it.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
εκ του κοϲμου ουκ ειϲιν · καθωϲ εγω ουκ ειμι εκ του κοϲμου ·

**English Translation**
Of the world they are not; just as I am not of the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Repetition confirms the reality. The Lord iterates this truth to solidify the identity of the Church. Our nature is defined by our Head. If the Head is heavenly, the body cannot be merely terrestrial. We walk upon the earth, but our *politeuma* (citizenship) is defined by the origin of the Son.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
αγιαϲον αυτουϲ εν τη αληθι αληθια ϲου ο λογοϲ ο ϲοϲ αληθια εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
Sanctify them in the truth [corrected: truth] of yours; the word that is yours is truth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stumbles over *alētheia* (truth), writing it twice, perhaps awestruck by the concept. Sanctification—the making holy—is not a ritual washing, but an immersion in Reality. The "Word" (*Logos*) is not merely spoken syllables, but the substance of God. To be sanctified is to be enveloped by the Logos. Truth is not what we know; Truth is what makes us holy.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
καθωϲ ε απεϲτιλαϲ ειϲ τον κοϲμον · καγω απεϲτιλα αυτουϲ ειϲ τον κοϲμον ·

**English Translation**
Just as me [eme] you sent into the world; I also sent them into the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mission is a mirror. The Father sends the Son (Incarnation); the Son sends the servants (Apostolic Mission). The preposition *eis* (into) denotes a violent entry of light into darkness. We are not merely wandering; we are *sent* (*apestila*). The authority of the Church is derivative, flowing entirely from the original descent of the Christ.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ϋπερ αυτων αγιαζω εμαυτον · ϊνα ω και αυτοι ηγια εν αληθι ˙

**English Translation**
And on behalf of them I sanctify myself; that they also might be sanctified [hēgiasmenoi] in truth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
How can the Holy One "sanctify" Himself? He sets Himself apart as the victim for the altar. This is the language of sacrifice. He consecrates His humanity to death so that our humanity might be consecrated to life. The abbreviation *hēgia* marks the result: we become "sanctified ones" not by our merit, but as a consequence of His self-offering.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ου περι τουτων δε ερωτω μονον . αλλα και περι των πιϲτευοντων δι του λογου αυτων ειϲ εμε ·

**English Translation**
Not concerning these only do I ask, but also concerning those believing through the word of them in me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Lift your eyes, brethren, for here the Lord speaks of us. He looks beyond the circle of the Twelve to the generations "believing through their word." The faith is mediated; it comes *dia* (through) the apostolic testimony. We are present in the Upper Room by the foresight of the Son. His prayer covers the 4th century as surely as the 1st.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα παντεϲ ἑν, ωϲιν · καθωϲ ϲυ πατερʼ εν εμοι . καγω εν ϲοι · ϊνα κ(αι) αυτοι εν ημιν ἑν ωϲιν · ϊνα ο κοϲμοϲ πιϲτευη πιϲτευϲη · οτι ϲυ με απεϲτιλαϲ ·

**English Translation**
That all might be one; just as you, Father, in me, and I in you; that also they in us might be one; that the world might believe [corrected: might come to believe] that you sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mystery of Unity. It is not political agreement, but *perichoresis*—mutual indwelling. As the Father is in the Son, we are to be in God. The scribe alters *pisteuē* (present continuous) to *pisteusē* (aorist), sharpening the focus: the unity of the Church is the catalyst for the singular event of the world's conviction. When we are fractured, the world doubts the Sender.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
καγω την δοξαν ην δε μοι . εδω αυτοιϲ · ϊνα ωϲ ἑν, καθωϲ ημειϲ ἑν εϲμεν :

**English Translation**
And I, the glory which [you have given] to me, I gave to them; that they might be one, just as we are one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The glue of this unity is *doxa* (glory). The Lord shares His divine prerogative with dust. He has given us the glory—the weight of the Spirit—that He received from the Father. We are one not because we agree, but because we share the same divine substance of glory. The text is truncated (*de* for *dedōkas*), as if the immensity of the gift breaks the grammar.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
εγω εν αυτοιϲ · και ϲυ εν εμοι · ϊνα ω τετελιωμενοι · ειϲ ἑν · και γινωϲκη ο κοϲμοϲ · οτι ϲυ με απεϲτιλαϲ · και η αυτουϲ · κα εμε ηγαπη ·

**English Translation**
I in them; and you in me; that they might be perfected into one; and the world might know that you sent me; and [you loved] them; [just as] me [you loved].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is heavily abbreviated (*ē* for *ēgapēsas*, *ka* for *kathōs*), a breathless recording of the deepest theology. "Perfected into one" (*teteliōmenoi*) implies a process reaching its end. The climax of the revelation is this: the Father loves the disciples with the *exact same love* with which He loves the Son. There is no lesser love for the Church; we are loved within the Son.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
πατερʼ . ο δε μοι θελω ϊνα οπου ειμι ε · κακεινοι ω μετ εμου · ϊνα θεωρωϲιν την δοξαν την εμην · ην δεδωκαϲ μοι ˙ οτι ηγαπηϲαϲ με προ καταβοληϲ κο ·

**English Translation**
Father, [what] [you have given] to me, I will that where I am [ego]; those also might be with me; that they might behold the glory that is mine; which you have given to me; because you loved me before the foundation of the world [kosmou].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final will (*thelō*) of the Son is our presence with Him. It is not enough for Him to save us; He desires our company. To "behold the glory" is the Beatific Vision, the end of all human striving. This love predates the "foundation of the cosmos." Before matter existed, the love between Father and Son existed, and we are invited into that pre-cosmic, eternal embrace.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
πατερ δικαι · και ο κοϲμοϲ ϲε ουκ εγνω . εγω δε ϲε εγνων : και ου εγνωϲαν · οτι ϲυ με απεϲτιλαϲ ·

**English Translation**
Righteous Father; and the world knew You not; but I knew You; and [these] knew that You sent Me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the solemn address, *Pater Dikai* (Righteous Father). The Lord appeals to the justice of the Father, for the world has rejected the Maker, yet the Son has acknowledged Him. The Codex here presents a stark division: *kai ho kosmos se ouk egno* (and the world did not know You). The conjunction *kai* binds the righteousness of the Father to the judgment of the world's ignorance.

We must attend to the reading *kai ou egnosan*. The scribe has written *ou* (not/where/these?), a truncation or distinct reading for *outoi* (these ones). We do not read this as "and they did *not* know," for that would annul the Lord's prior affirmation that "they have known surely that I came out from Thee." Rather, we discern in this *ou* the demonstrative presence of the faithful Apostles standing by Him. The world is ignorant; the Son is knowing by nature; and "these" (*ou[toi]*) are knowing by grace and revelation. They have grasped the essential dogma: *hoti sy me apestilas* (that You sent Me). In this confession of the Sent One, the disciples are separated from the ignorant world and united to the knowing Son.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και εγνωριϲα αυ το ονομα ϲου · και γνωριϲω ˙ η αγαπη · ην ηγα αυτουϲ · ε αυτοιϲ ῆ · καγω εν αυτοιϲ :

**English Translation**
And I made known to them Your name; and I will make [it] known; [that] the love [with] which You loved them in them may be; and I in them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the seal of the High Priestly prayer. The Lord says *egnorisa* (I made known) regarding the past ministry, and *gnoriso* (I will make known) regarding the future work of the Cross and the Spirit. The text before us is heavily contracted, bearing the marks of a scribe hastening toward the sacred mystery. *Hega* stands for *hegapesas* (You loved), and *e* for *en* (in).

The final purpose of this revelation is union: that the very *agape*—the divine love wherewith the Father loves the Son—might not merely hover over them, but be *en autois* (in them). The subjunctive *e* (may be) indicates the contingency of our reception of this grace. And the ultimate mystery is the indwelling Christ: *kago en autois* (and I in them). He does not say "and I among them," but *in* them. Thus, the Christian soul becomes the vessel of the Son, and through the Son, possesses the love of the Father. The prayer ends not with a plea for escape, but with the promise of indwelling presence.
