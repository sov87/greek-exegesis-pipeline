**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ην δε τιϲ αϲθεν λαζαροϲ απο βηθα εκ τηϲ κω τηϲ μαριαϲ · και μαρθαϲ τηϲ α αυτηϲ ·

**English Translation**
Now there was a certain [man] sick, Lazaros, from Betha[ny], of the vill[age] of the Maria; and of Martha the sis[ter] of her.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe how the Evangelist anchors the man’s identity not in his deeds, but in his suffering (*asthen*) and his kinship. The village (*kō*) is defined by the women, Maria and Martha, suggesting their spiritual prominence in the community of the faithful. Lazarus is introduced as "sick"; thus, human frailty is the stage upon which the glory of God is about to be dramatized.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ην δε μαρια η α τον μυ · και εκμαξαϲα τουϲ ποδαϲ αυτου ταιϲ θριξιν αυτηϲ · ηϲ ο αδελφοϲ λα ηϲθενι ·

**English Translation**
Now it was Maria who an[ointed] the [Lord] with my[rrh/ointment], and wiped his feet with her hairs; whose brother La[zaros] was sick.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text identifies the woman by a future act of extreme devotion—anointing the Lord for burial—before narrating the present crisis. The scribe abbreviates the act (*a*) and the ointment (*my*), assuming the reader knows this mystery well. The sickness of the brother is inextricably bound to the woman who humbles her own glory (her hair) to serve the Lord.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
απεϲτιλαν ουν προϲ αυτον αι α λεγουϲαι · · ϊδε ον φιλειϲ αϲθενει :

**English Translation**
Therefore the sis[ters] sent to him, saying: See, [he] whom you love is sick.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the brevity of their prayer. They do not command the Lord to come; they do not prescribe a cure. They simply present the reality to Him: *ide* (See). They appeal not to Lazarus's merit, but to the Lord's affection (*phileis*). It is the confidence of the beloved that needs only to expose the wound to the Healer.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ακουϲαϲ δε ο ει · αυτη η αϲθε ουκ εϲτιν προϲ θανατον · αλλʼ ϋπερ τηϲ δο του · αλλ ι δοξαϲθη ο του δι αυτηϲ ·

**English Translation**
But having heard, he sai[d]: This sick[ness] is not unto death; but for the glo[ry] of the [God]; but th[at] the [Son] of the [God] might be glorified through it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord looks through the temporal event to the eternal purpose. The sickness has a trajectory, yet its destination is not death (*pros thanaton*), but glory (*doxa*). The scribal abbreviations here (*do tou*, *o tou*) rush us toward the divine titles. The suffering of the flesh is the vehicle for the revelation of the Son.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
ηγαπα δε ο την μαρθαν · και την αδελφην αυτηϲ · και τον λαζαρον ·

**English Translation**
Now [Jesus] loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazaros.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A crucial theological pivot. The Evangelist affirms the Lord's love (*ēgapa*) for each specific person before describing His delay. This assures us that the silence of God is not the absence of love. He names them, sanctifying individual friendship within the economy of salvation.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ ουν ηκουϲ ηκουϲ οτι αϲθενει · τοτε μεν εμινεν εν ω ην τοπω · δυο η ·

**English Translation**
When therefore he heard [heard] that he is sick, then indeed he remained in the place where he was two da[ys].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stutters with *ēkous ēkous* (heard heard), emphasizing the certainty of His knowledge. Yet, the response to love is delay. He waits two days (*duo ē*) so that the sickness may run its full course to death. He waits, that He might not merely heal a sick man, but raise a dead one, thereby conquering the ultimate enemy.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
επιτα με τουτο λεγει τοιϲ μαθηταιϲ · αγωμ ειϲ την ϊουδαι ϊουδαι παλιν ·

**English Translation**
Then af[ter] this he says to the disciples: Let us go into Judea [Judea] again.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is simple but perilous. The scribe repeats *ioudean* (Judea), perhaps an error, or perhaps reflecting the intense gravity of the name—the place of hostility. To return to Judea is to walk into the jaws of the passion. He invites the disciples to accompany Him into the danger zone of faith.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λεγουϲιν αυτω οι μαθηται · ραββει · νυν εζητουν ϲε λιθαϲε οι ϊουδαι · και παλιν ϋπα εκει :

**English Translation**
The disciples say to him: Rabbi, now the Jews were seeking to stone you; and again goest [thou] there?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples are trapped in the logic of self-preservation. They remember the stones (*lithase*) of the recent past ("now"). They address Him as *Rabbi*, acknowledging His authority, yet they question His prudence. They see the threat of death; He sees the sleep of a friend.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη · ουχι δωδεκα ωραι ειϲ ειϲ τηϲ ημεραϲ · εαν τιϲ περιπατη εν τη ημερα ου προϲ · οτι το φωϲ του κοϲμου του τουτου βλεπει ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] answered: Are there not twelve hours [are] of the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumb[le]; because he sees the light of [this] world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks of the divine appointment of time. The "twelve hours" represent the allotted time of His ministry. As long as one walks in the will of the Father (the day), no stone can strike before the hour is come. The repetition of *toutou* (this) emphasizes the physical reality of the light, a type of the spiritual illumination He provides.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
εαν δε τιϲ περιπατη εν τη νυκτει · προϲκο · οτι το φωϲ ουκ εϲτιν εν αυτω ·

**English Translation**
But if anyone walks in the night, he stumb[les]; because the light is not in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Darkness is defined here not by the setting of the sun, but by the absence of the interior light. To walk without the divine command is to walk in the night (*nyktei*). The danger lies not in Judea, but in acting apart from the Light of the World.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπεν · και μετα τουτο · λεγει αυτοιϲ · λαζαροϲ ο φιλοϲ ημων κεκοιμηται · αλ πορευομαι εξϋπνιϲω αυτ ·

**English Translation**
These things he said; and after this he says to them: Lazaros our friend has fallen asleep; but I go [that] I may awaken hi[m].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the Christian redefinition of death. For the Creator, death is merely *koimēsis* (sleeping), a state from which one is easily roused (*exypnisō*). He calls Lazarus "our friend," sharing the burden of love with the fearful disciples, inviting them to participate in the awakening.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ειπαν ουν αυτω οι μαθηται · ει κεκοιμηται ϲω ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the disciples said to him: If he has fallen asleep, he will be sa[ved/cured].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples grasp at a medical interpretation to avoid a spiritual journey. If he is sleeping, the fever is breaking, and he will be saved (*sō*—abbreviated form of *sōthēsetai*). They prefer a recovering Lazarus afar off to a resurrected Lazarus that requires them to risk their lives in Judea. They seek safety; He seeks glory.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ειρηκι δε ο περι του θα αυτου · εκεινοι δε εδοξαν · οτι πε τηϲ κοιμηϲε του ϋπνου λεγει ·

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] had spoken concerning his death; yet those men supposed that he speaks concerning the taking of rest in sleep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the chasm between the Divine Mind and human perception. The Lord speaks of the finality of the flesh (`θα` — death), yet the disciples, bound by earthly reasoning, imagine He speaks of the restoration of the body through slumber (`κοιμηϲε του ϋπνου`). The Shepherd sees the spiritual reality where death is but a sleep to be awakened from, while the sheep, fearing the wolf, cling to the literal hope of physical rest.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
τοτε ουν ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο παρηϲι παρρηϲια · λαζαροϲ απεθα ·

**English Translation**
Then therefore [Jesus] said to them plainly: Lazarus died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord strips away the veil of metaphor. Because their hearts were dull, He employs `παρρηϲια` (plainness/boldness). There is no softening of the blow here: `λαζαροϲ απεθα` (Lazarus died). Truth must sometimes wound before it can heal; the Physician acknowledges the full reality of the corruption before applying the remedy of the Resurrection.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
και χαιρω δι ϋμαϲ · πιϲτευ · οτι ουκ ημ ημ εκι · αλλα αγωμεν προϲ αυτον ·

**English Translation**
And I rejoice for your sakes, [that ye might] believe, that I was not there; but let us go to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery is revealed: the Savior rejoices (`χαιρω`) in His own absence (`ουκ ημ` — I was not [there]). Why? For the sake of their faith (`πιϲτευ`). Had He been present, the sick would have healed, but the dead would not be raised. He permits the greater sorrow to manifest the greater glory. He commands `αγωμεν` (let us go) not merely to the sickbed, but into the very face of death.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν θωμαϲ ο λεγομενοϲ δι τοιϲ ϲυν · αγω και ημιϲ ϊνα αποθανωμεν μετ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Therefore Thomas, the one called Didymus, said to the fellow-disciples: Let us go also, that we may die with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Thomas, called the Twin (`δι`), displays the courage of despair. He perceives the danger of Judea but not the power of the Christ. "Let us die with him" (`αποθανωμεν μετ αυτου`) is the language of the martyr, yet spoken here in blindness. He is willing to share the Lord's tomb, not yet understanding that the Lord goes to shatter the tomb.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ελθ ελθ ουν ο ειϲ βηθανιαν ευρεν αυ τεϲϲαρεϲ η ηδη εχον εν τω μνημι ·

**English Translation**
Therefore coming to Bethany, [Jesus] found him having already [spent] four days in the tomb.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text emphasizes the duration: `τεϲϲαρεϲ` (four [days]). The corruption is established; the hope of mere resuscitation is extinguished. He is `εν τω μνημι` (in the tomb). The Lord arrives when human hope has fully disintegrated, demonstrating that He is Master not only of the dying body but of the decayed dust.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ην δε η βηθα εγγυϲ των ϊ ωϲ απο ϲταδι δεκαπεντε ·

**English Translation**
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The geography serves the theology of the Passion. Bethany (`βηθα`) is `εγγυϲ` (near) the city of the sacrifice (`των ϊ` — Jerusalem). Fifteen stadia is a short distance; the shout of this miracle will echo immediately into the halls of those seeking His life. The glory of Lazarus is the prelude to the Cross.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
πολ δε εκ των ϊου εληλυθι προϲ την μαρ · και μαριαν · ϊνα παραμυθη αυταϲ πε του αδελφου ˙

**English Translation**
And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, in order that they might comfort them concerning the brother.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The house of mourning is crowded (`πολ` — many). These witnesses are gathered by Providence so that the miracle cannot be hidden. They come to comfort (`παραμυθη`), a noble human effort yet ultimately futile against the sting of death. Only the Word can offer true consolation by reversing the cause of the grief (`πε του αδελφου` — concerning the brother).

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
η ουν μαρθα · ωϲ η οτι ερ · ϋπηντηϲ ϋπηντηϲ αυτω · μαρια δε εν τω οικω εκαθε ˙

**English Translation**
Therefore Martha, as she heard that [Jesus] is coming, met him; but Mary was sitting in the house.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see the two temperaments of the soul. Martha, active and anxious, hears (`η`) and immediately goes forth (`ϋπηντηϲ`) to meet the Lord. Mary remains `εν τω οικω` (in the house), in the stillness of grief. Both seek the Lord, but Martha runs to Him while He is yet on the road, unable to wait, driven by the urgency of her loss.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν η μαρθα προϲ · · ει ηϲ ωδε · ου αν απεθανεν ο αδελφοϲ μου ·

**English Translation**
Therefore Martha said to [Jesus]: If thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A confession of faith mingled with the limitation of the flesh. She believes in His power to preserve life (`ει ηϲ ωδε` — if thou hadst been here), yet she binds His power to His physical presence. She confronts the Life-giver with the finality of death: `απεθανεν` (he died). She looks to the past with regret, not yet seeing the Omnipresent One who holds the keys of death.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
αλλα και νυν οιδα · οτι οϲα εαν αιτηϲει τον · δωϲει ϲοι ο ·

**English Translation**
But even now I know that whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the light breaks through the gloom. `αλλα και νυν` (But even now)—in the face of four days of death—she asserts `οιδα` (I know). She acknowledges the Son's unique relation to the Father (`τον` / `ο` — God). She understands Him as the Mediator whose petition (`αιτηϲει`) cannot be refused, though she does not yet dare to ask for the resurrection explicitly.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη ο · αναϲτηϲεται ο αδελφοϲ ϲου ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] says to her: Thy brother shall rise again.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise is absolute and unqualified: `αναϲτηϲεται` (he shall rise). The Lord does not offer mere sympathy, but a decree of reversal. He speaks of the immediate act He is about to perform, yet the ambiguity of the future tense allows Martha to retreat into the safety of distant doctrine rather than immediate hope.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
λεγι αυτω μαρθα · οι οτι αναϲτηϲε εν τη αναϲτα εν τη εϲχα ημερα ·

**English Translation**
Martha says to him: I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Martha confesses the orthodox faith of the Church: the `αναϲτα` (resurrection) in the `εϲχα ημερα` (last day). Yet, this is a deferral. She consoles herself with the end of time, failing to recognize that the Power of the Last Day stands before her in the present moment. She knows the doctrine, but she has not yet grasped that the Resurrection is a Person, not merely an event.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε αυτη ο · εγω ειμι η αναϲταϲιϲ · και η ζωη · ο πιϲτευ ειϲ εμε καν αποθανη · ζηϲε ·

**English Translation**
But Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life; the [one] believing in me, even if he dies, shall live.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the majesty of the Divine Name. He does not say, "I shall bring about resurrection," as a prophet might promise a future grace, but declares *Ego eimi*—"I AM." The Resurrection is not an event to be awaited in the distant epoch, but a Person standing before her. The text abbreviates *pisteu* (believing) and *zēse* (shall live), linking faith and life as an inseparable mystery. Even if the body suffers the dissolution of nature (*apothanē*), the believer possesses an indestructible vitality because they are grafted into the One who Is.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και παϲ ο ζων και πιϲτευων ει εμε · ου μη απο ειϲ τον αι · πιϲτευειϲ τουτο ·

**English Translation**
And everyone living and believing in me shall by no means die into the age; do you believe this?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Lord distinguishes the second death from the first. In the previous verse, He admitted the possibility of physical death; here, using the emphatic double negative *ou mē*, He abolishes the terror of eternal death (*eis ton ai[ōna]*). The living soul that believes cannot be extinguished. He turns the doctrine into an interrogation: *pisteueis touto*? Dogma must become personal confession. It is not enough to know the truth; one must be gripped by it.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω · ναι · εγω πεπι · οτι ϲυ ει ο <I>XϹ</I> ο <I>YϹ</I> του <I>ΘΥ</I> ο ειϲ τον κοϲμον ερχομενοϲ ·

**English Translation**
She says to him: Yes; I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the [one] coming into the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Martha’s response is the rock of orthodoxy. She uses the perfect tense *pepi[steuka]* ("I have believed"), indicating a settled, unshakeable conviction that precedes the miracle. She confesses the full dignity of the Lord using the sacred Nomina Sacra: He is the Anointed (*XϹ*), the Son (*YϹ*) of God (*ΘΥ*). She identifies Him as the "Coming One," fulfilling the prophetic expectation. She believes in the Giver of Life before she sees the restoration of life.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
και τουτο ειπουϲα · α και εφω μαριαν την αδελφην αυ λαθρα · ειπου · ο διδαϲκαλοϲ παρεϲτιν και φω ϲε ·

**English Translation**
And having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying: The Teacher is present and calls [for] you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Notice the discretion of the faithful; she speaks *lathra* (secretly), perhaps to shield the Master from the hostility of the lurking Jews, or to preserve the intimacy of Mary’s grief. Jesus is acknowledged as *Ho Didaskalos* (The Teacher). It is He who initiates the encounter; *phō[nei]* (He calls). The Word calls the soul to Himself before the soul can move toward the Word.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
εκεινη δε ωϲ ηκουϲεν ηγερθη ταχυ · και ηρχετο προϲ αυ ·

**English Translation**
And she, when she heard, rose up quickly and was coming to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The response to the Divine call is immediate action. There is no hesitation in Mary. The text says *ēgerthē* (she was raised/rose) *tachy* (quickly). This physical rising is a precursor to the spiritual and physical raising of Lazarus. She "was coming" (*ērcheto*—imperfect tense), painting the picture of her movement away from the mourners and toward the Consolation of Israel.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ουπω δε ελη ο <I>IϹ</I> ειϲ την κωμην · αλλ ην ετι εν τω τοπω · οπου ϋπηντηϲ αυτω η μαρθα ·

**English Translation**
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord remains outside the confusion of the village. He stands *en tō topō* (in the place) of confession, where Martha had just declared His Divinity. He does not enter the house of mourning to join the chaotic grief of the world; rather, He draws the mourners out to Himself, to the place of faith and revelation.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
οι ουν ϊουδαιοι οι οντεϲ μετ αυτηϲ εν τη οικια και παραμυθουμε αυτην · την μαριαν ο ταχεωϲ ανεϲτη και εξηλθεν · η αυ δοξαντεϲ · οτι ειϲ το μνημιον ϊνα κλαυϲη εκει ˙

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews, the [ones] being with her in the house and consoling her, [seeing] Mary that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that [she goes] to the tomb to weep there.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world misunderstands the movements of faith. The Jews suppose Mary goes to the *mnēmion* (tomb) to weep, for they know only death and the rituals of sorrow. They follow her, unwittingly being led to the Source of Life. They think she seeks the dead, but she seeks the Living One. The crowd is drawn into the miracle through their misinterpretation of her devotion.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
η ουν μαρια ωϲ ηλθεν οπου ην ο <I>IϹ</I> · ϊδουϲα αυτον επεϲεν αυτου προϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ · λεγου αυτω ˙ · ει ηϲ ω ουκ αν μου απε ο αδελφοϲ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore Mary, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him: [Lord], if you were here, my brother would not have died.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mary repeats the exact lament of Martha, yet her posture differs. She *epesen* (fell) at His feet. This is the adoration of the heart-broken. She acknowledges His power to prevent death (*ouk an... apethanen*), yet she limits His power to His physical presence ("if you were here"). She has not yet grasped that He who fills the heavens is always "here," and that His authority transcends distance and biological cessation.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
<I>IϹ</I> ουν ωϲ ειδεν αυτ κλαιουϲαν · και τουϲ ϲυνελθον αυτη ϊουδαιουϲ κλαιονταϲ · εβρι ενεβριμηϲατο ενεβριμηϲατο τω π και εταραξεν εαυ ·

**English Translation**
Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews having come with her weeping, he gro- groaned [in] the spirit and troubled himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex here reveals a profound struggle in the text itself—*ebri enebrimēsato enebrimēsato*—a stuttering repetition emphasizing the intensity of the Lord's emotion. He "groaned" with indignation. This is not mere sadness; it is the warrior's wrath against the tyranny of death and the unbelief of the crowd. He *etaraxen heauton* (troubled himself); He was not passively overcome by emotion, but voluntarily allowed the turbulence of spirit to manifest, showing He is fully man even as He prepares to act as God.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν · που τεθικαται αυτον · λεγουϲιν αυτω · ερχου και ϊδε ·

**English Translation**
And he said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Come and see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He who knows all things asks "Where?" not for information, but to invite human agency. He compels them to face the reality of the grave. Their response, "Come and see" (*erchou kai ide*), ironically echoes the invitation of the disciples to Christ in the beginning. Now, humanity invites God to look upon the corruption it has wrought through sin. He descends to see the depth of our fall.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και εδακρυϲεν ο <I>IϹ</I> ·

**English Translation**
And Jesus wept.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
In this brevity lies the ocean of Divine compassion. The text uses *edakrysen* (shed tears), a silent weeping, distinct from the wailing (*klaiousan*) of the crowd. He weeps not because He is helpless, for He is about to act; He weeps from sympathy with the sorrow of His creatures. The Creator weeps for the destruction of His image. Behold the Incarnation: God has eyes, and those eyes shed tears.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ελε ελεγον ουν οι ϊουδαι · ϊδε πωϲ εφιλει αυτον ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews were sa- saying: See how he loved him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribal stutter *ele elegon* again captures the murmuring of the onlookers. They witness the *philei* (friendship/love) of Jesus, yet they judge by the standard of the tomb. They interpret His tears as a sign of defeat and past affection, failing to see them as the prelude to a victory that will shatter the gates of Hades. They see the love, but they do not yet see the Power.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
τινεϲ δε ε αυτων ειπαν ειπον · ου ηδυνατο ουτοϲ ο ανοιξαϲ τουϲ ο του τυ · ποιηϲαι ϊνα και ουτοϲ μη απο :

**English Translation**
But some of them said [said]: Could not this man, the one having opened the [eyes] of the blind [man], have caused that this man also not die?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the murmurings of the skeptics. The scribe’s repetition (*eipan eipon*) reflects the stuttering confusion of the crowd. They acknowledge the miracle of the blind man (*tou ty*), yet they use past grace to fuel present doubt. They reason as men of earth: if He healed the eyes, why not prevent the death? They do not understand that the Lord permits death only to conquer it utterly, not merely to delay it.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ουν παλιν εμβρι εν ε ερχεται ειϲ το μνημιον · ην δε ϲπηλαιον · και λιθοϲ επεκειτο επ αυ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [Jesus], again groaning in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord groans (*embri[momenos]*) in spirit. This is the indignation of the Life-Giver against the unnatural tyranny of death. He approaches the *mnemion* (memorial-tomb), which is a cave—a womb of the earth where the dead await the new birth. The stone lies upon it, signifying the hardness of the law and the barrier of sin that separates the corruptible from the incorruptible, which only the Rock of Ages can remove.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ο · αρα τον λιθον · λεγι αυ η αδελφη του τετελευτηκοτοϲ μαρθα · ηδη ο · τεταρταιοϲ γαρ εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
He says: Take away the stone. The sister of the deceased, Martha, says to him: Lord, by now he smells; for he is a fourth-day man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command is absolute: *ara ton lithon* (lift the stone). Yet human reason, voiced by Martha, recoils. She confesses the reality of corruption (*ozei* - he stinks). To be a "fourth-day man" (*tetartaios*) is to be beyond hope in Jewish thought, for the spirit was thought to depart after three days. Martha looks at the decay of nature; Christ looks at the restoration of nature. He demands the removal of the obstacle despite the stench of our mortality.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτη ο · ουκ ειπον ϲοι · οτι εαν πιϲτευϲηϲ οψη την δοξαν του ·

**English Translation**
He says to her: Did I not say to you, that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the divine order: Faith precedes Vision. He does not say "see and believe," but "believe and you shall see" (*opse*). The *doxa* (glory) of God is not merely light or thunder, but the reversal of death itself. The Lord rebukes her gentle hesitation, reminding her that the promises of the Word are surer than the biological reality of the grave.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ηραν ουν τον λι ˙ ο δε ηρεν τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ ανω κ(αι) κ(αι) ειπεν · πατερʼ ευχα ϲοι οτι ηκου μου ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they took away the stone. But Jesus lifted his eyes upward and [and] said: Father, I thank you that you heard me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stone is removed by human hands, co-operating with grace. The Lord lifts His eyes *ano* (upward), teaching us the posture of prayer. Note the scribal dittography (*kai kai*), perhaps a pause of reverence. He says *eucha[risto]* (I thank you) before the miracle occurs. This is the confidence of the Only-Begotten; He does not ask *if* the Father will hear, for their Will is one. He thanks the Father to show the crowd that the power is from above, not from sorcery.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
εγω δε η · οτι παντοτε μου ακουειϲ · αλλα δια τον οχλον τ περιεϲτωτα ειπ ειπ · ϊνα πιϲτευϲωϲ οτι ϲυ με απεϲτι ·

**English Translation**
And I knew that you always hear me; but because of the crowd standing around I said [said] it, that they might believe that you sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound revelation of the inner life of the Trinity. There is never a moment the Father does not hear the Son. The vocal prayer is *economical*—spoken solely for the *ochlos* (crowd). He speaks so that they might know He is the *Apostolos* (the Sent One) of the Father. The stutter in the text (*eip eip*) emphasizes the deliberate nature of this spoken word.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
και ταυτα ει · φωνη με εκραυγαζ εκραυγαϲ λαζαρ λαζαρε · δευρο εξω ·

**English Translation**
And having said these things, with a loud voice he cried out [cried out]: Lazarus, Lazarus, come out!

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Great Cry. The scribe struggles with the intensity, writing *ekraugaz ekraugas* (crying out, he cried out). He names the dead man twice—*Lazar Lazare*—calling him personally from the abyss. If He had not named him, perhaps all the dead would have risen then and there! *Deuro exo* (Hither, out!) is the command of the Creator to the creature, summoning being from non-being.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
και εξηλθεν ο τε δεδε τουϲ πο και ταϲ χιραϲ κιριαιϲ · και η οψιϲ αυτου ϲουδαριω περιεδεδετο · λε αυτοιϲ ο λυ αυτον · και α ϋπαγειν :

**English Translation**
And the dead man came out, bound feet and hands with grave-strips; and his face was bound around with a sudarium. Jesus says to them: Loose him, and let him go.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the miracle within the miracle: he walks while bound (*dedemenos*). The *keiriais* (grave strips) and *sudarium* (sweat-cloth) bind him, symbols of the lingering vestiges of death and sin. Christ commands the community: "Loose him." God raises the dead, but He commands the Church (the ministers) to unbind the sinner, releasing him from the censures and habits of the old life.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
πολλοι δε εκ των ϊουδαιων οι ελθ προϲ την μα · και θεαϲα · α εποιηϲεν επιϲτευϲαν ειϲ αυ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore many of the Jews, the ones having come to Mary and having seen what he did, believed in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sight (*theasamenoi*) of the Resurrected One conquers the heart. They came to comfort Mary (*Ma[riam]*), but found themselves comforted by Life. This is the proper response to the sign: faith (*episteusan*) flowing into the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
τινεϲ δε εξ αυ απηλθον προϲ τουϲ φαριϲαιουϲ · και ειπαν αυτοιϲ · ἁ εποιηϲεν ο ·

**English Translation**
But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus did.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of iniquity. Even the raising of the dead does not convert the obstinate. Some become informers, running to the Pharisees. They treat the miracle not as a revelation of God, but as a reportable offense against the established order. Light shines, and darkness comprehends it not, but seeks to extinguish it.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ϲυνηγαγον ουν οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι φαριϲαιοι ϲυνεδρι · και ελεγαν · τι ποιουμεν · οτι ου ο ανθρωποϲ πολλα ποιει ϲημι ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and were saying: What are we doing? For this man does many signs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Sanhedrin (*synedrion*) gathers in futility. They ask "What are we doing?"—a confession of their own impotence. They admit the facts: "this man does many signs" (*semeia*). They do not deny the miracles, for they are undeniable; instead, they view the miracles as a political problem to be solved. This is the blindness of power.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
εαν αφωμεν αυ ουτωϲ · παντεϲ πιϲτευουϲιν πιϲτευϲουϲιν ειϲ αυ · και ελευϲον οι ρωμαιοι · και αρουϲιν ημων και τον τοπον · κ(αι) το εθνοϲ :

**English Translation**
If we let him alone thus, all will believe [will believe] in him; and the Romans will come and take away both our place and the nation.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Prophecy spoken in fear. The scribe wavers between present and future (*pisteuousin pisteusousin*), showing the inevitability of the people's faith. The leaders fear the Romans will take their "place" (*topon* - the Temple) and nation. In rejecting the Savior to save their political station, they lost all. For in the year 70, the Romans did come, and they took away the Place and the Nation precisely because they did not know the time of their visitation.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
ειϲ δε τιϲ εξ αυτων · καϊαφαϲ · αρχϊερευϲ ων του ενιαυτου ε · ειπεν αυ · ϋμιϲ ουκ οι ουδεν ·

**English Translation**
But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest of *that* year, said to *them*: You know nothing;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the supreme irony placed in the mouth of the High Priest. Caiaphas stands in the seat of Aaron, yet his heart is far from the God of Aaron. He accuses his brethren of ignorance—"You know nothing"—while he himself is the most ignorant of all regarding the Mystery of God standing before him. The Holy Spirit marks the time precisely: "of that year" (του ενιαυτου ε). It was not merely a calendar year, but the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of the true Sacrifice, where the shadow of the Levitical priesthood was about to be swallowed by the reality of the Order of Melchizedek.

**Verse 50**


**Greek Text**
ουδε λογιζεϲθε · οτι ϲυμ · ϊνα ειϲ αν αποθα ϋπερ του λαου · και μη ολον το εθνοϲ αποληται ·

**English Translation**
Nor do you reason that it is *expedient*, that one *man* should *die* on behalf of the people, and not the whole nation perish.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the logic of the world clashing with the logic of God. Caiaphas speaks from political expediency (ϲυμ), thinking to save the temporal structure of the nation by shedding innocent blood. Yet, look at how the Truth forces itself through his wicked intent! He unwittingly articulates the very doctrine of Atonement: One *man* (αν) must die so the many may live. He seeks to save the "nation" (political Israel), but God intends to save the "people" (the spiritual Israel). The wolf prophesies the work of the Shepherd.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
τουτο δε αφ εαυ ουκ ειπεν · αλ αρχϊερευϲ ων του ενιαυτου εκι επροφητευϲ · οτι εμελλεν απο · ϋπερ του εθνουϲ ·

**English Translation**
But this he said not from *himself*, but being high priest of *that* year he prophesied that [Jesus] was about to *die* on behalf of the nation;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Do not marvel that a wicked man prophesies; for the grace of the priesthood rests upon the chair, even if the one sitting in it is unworthy. Balaam prophesied, and here Caiaphas does the same. The Evangelist is careful to note he spoke "not from himself" (αφ εαυ ουκ). The Spirit of God utilized the office of the High Priesthood one last time to declare the end of the Old Covenant. He was "about to die" (εμελλεν απο)—the inevitability of the Passion is declared from the very sanctuary of those who seek to inflict it.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
και ου ϋπερ του εθνουϲ δε μονον · αλλ ϊνα και τα τεκνα του τα διεϲκορπιϲ ϲυναγαγη ειϲ εν

**English Translation**
And not on behalf of the nation only, but in order that also the scattered children of *God* he might gather into one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the catholicity of the Church! The Jewish High Priest thinks only of the "nation" (Israel according to the flesh), but the Spirit expands the prophecy to the "scattered children" (τα διεϲκορπιϲ). Who are these but the Gentiles and the lost sheep, whom the Cross shall draw together? The purpose of the death is unity: "gather into one" (ϲυναγαγη ειϲ εν). As the shepherd gathers the flock, so the blood of Christ cements the stones of the Church into one building, destroying the wall of partition.

**Verse 53**

**Greek Text**
απ εκεινηϲ ουν τηϲ ημεραϲ εβουλευϲαντο ϊ αποκτινωϲιν αυτον :

**English Translation**
Therefore from that day they took counsel *that* they might kill him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The raising of Lazarus was the final testimony that sealed the doom of the unbelievers. "From that day" marks the transition from sporadic hatred to a formal decree of death. The Sanhedrin, established to judge righteously, now conspires (εβουλευϲαντο) to commit deicide. They consult not on *if* they should kill the Life-Giver, but *how*. Thus, the darkness hates the light because its deeds are exposed.

**Verse 54**

**Greek Text**
ο ουν ουκετι παρ περιεπατει εν τοιϲ ϊουδαιοιϲ · αλλα απηλθεν ε ειϲ την χωραν · εγγυϲ τηϲ ερημου ειϲ εφρεμ λεγομενην πολ πολ κακει εμινεν με των μαθητ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [Jesus] no longer walked *openly* among the Jews, but went away *from there* into the country near the wilderness, into a *city* called Ephraim, and there he remained with the *disciples*.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord withdraws, not out of cowardice, but because his hour, though near, had not yet fully struck. He goes to Ephraim, a name meaning "fruitfulness," near the wilderness. Even in his withdrawal, he signifies that the wilderness of the Gentiles shall soon become fruitful. He remains with the "disciples" (μαθητ); the separation is becoming clear—the Shepherd with his little flock, separated from the wolves of Jerusalem. He prepares them in silence for the noise of the Passion.

**Verse 55**

**Greek Text**
ην δε εγγυϲ το πα των ϊουδαιων · και ανεβηϲαν πολ ειϲ ϊεροϲολυ εκ τηϲ χωραϲ · προ του παϲχα · ϊ αγνιϲωϲιν ε ·

**English Translation**
Now the *Passover* of the Jews was near; and *many* went up to *Jerusalem* out of the country before the Passover, *that* they might purify *themselves*.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text calls it the "Passover of the Jews" (πα των ϊουδαιων), distinguishing it from the true Passover of the Lord which is Christ himself. See the futility of their religion: they go up to "purify themselves" (αγνιϲωϲιν ε) with water and rites, yet their hearts are full of murder. They are scrupulous about ceremonial cleanness while preparing to stain their hands with the blood of the Innocent One. They purify the flesh but rot in the spirit.

**Verse 56**

**Greek Text**
εζητουν ουν τον και ελε μετ αλληλων εν τω εϲτη · τι δοκει ϋ οτι ου μη ελ ειϲ την εορτ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they were seeking [Jesus] and *saying* with one another *standing* in the [Temple]: What does it seem to *you*, that he will not *come* to the *feast*?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Temple (implied by where they stood) becomes a place of gossip rather than prayer. They seek him, but not for salvation; they seek him out of curiosity and malice. "Will he not come to the feast?" they ask. They do not know that He *is* the Feast. He must come, for the type cannot exist without the Antitype. The Lamb must be present at the slaughter. Their question betrays the tension of the city, waiting for the spark.

**Verse 57**

**Greek Text**
δεδωκιϲαν δε οι αρχϊεριϲ και οι φα εντολαϲ · ϊνα εαν τιϲ γνω που εϲτιν · μηνυ · οπωϲ πιαϲω αυτον :

**English Translation**
Now the high priests and the *Pharisees* had given commandments, that if anyone knew where he is, he should *report* it, so that they might *seize* him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter concludes with the net fully spread. The religious authorities issue "commandments" (εντολαϲ)—a word used for divine law—now perverted into a mandate for betrayal. They demand that the people become informants against their Savior. To "seize" (πιαϲω) the One who holds the universe in his hand is the height of human folly. Thus, the stage is set: the legal authorities have outlawed the Truth, preparing the way for the suffering of the Just.
