**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
εν αρχη ην ο λογοϲ και ο λογοϲ ην προϲ τον και ην ο λογοϲ

**English Translation**
In beginning was the word and the word was toward the [one] and was the word

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the absolute foundation of our faith, laid bare in the script. The Evangelist commences not with creation, but with the *Archē*—the principium. Note the reading here: the Logos *was*. It does not say He was made. He simply *was*. The text before us exhibits a profound mystery; it reads *pros ton* (toward the [one]), omitting the specific noun, yet the directionality is undeniable. The Word is not static; He is "toward" the Divine presence. Furthermore, this manuscript concludes the verse with *kai ēn ho logos* ("and was the word"), asserting the absolute existence of the Logos without a predicate nominative. He exists in and of Himself, an eternal assertion of being.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ου ην εν αρχη προϲ τον

**English Translation**
[He/This one] was in beginning toward the [one]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe provides the abbreviated *ou*, signifying *outos* (this one), referring back to the Logos. The repetition is not redundant but emphatic. He was not merely existing; He was *in the beginning* positioned *pros ton*—toward the [Father]. The preposition *pros* implies face-to-face intimacy. Even before the cosmos was framed, this relational posture existed. The text anchors the Logos in the primordial beginning, ensuring we understand His presence was not an afterthought of creation but the prerequisite for it.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
π δι αυτου εγενε και χωριϲ αυτου εγενετο ουδεν ουδε εν ˙ ὁ γεγονεν ·

**English Translation**
[P] through him came into being [all] and without him came into being nothing not even one thing; that which has come into being

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The letter *pi* marks a new section. The universality of the Logos's agency is absolute: *di autou* (through Him). The scribe abbreviates *egeneto* to *egene*, rushing to the negation: *choris autou* (without Him) nothing exists. Observe the punctuation carefully, for it defines our theology. The stop is placed after *oude en* (not even one thing). The phrase *ho gegonen* (that which has come into being) stands isolated at the end, acting as the bridge to the following verse. We do not read "nothing was made that was made," but rather, "nothing was made. That which has come into being..." This connects the created order directly to the Life found in the next breath.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
εν αυ ζωη εϲτιν · και η ζωη ην το φωϲ των ανθρω ·

**English Translation**
In [him] life is; and the life was the light of the [men]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A reading of trembling significance! The Codex reads *estin* (is), not *ēn* (was). "In Him life *is*." The life of the Logos is not a past historical event but an eternal, present reality. This intrinsic Life serves as the illumination for humanity (*anthrō*). The abbreviation of "men" suggests the collective totality of the race. The light is not external to Him; it is His very nature. He does not merely possess life; He is the locus where Life currently and eternally resides.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
και το φωϲ εν τη ϲκοτια φαι και η ϲκοτι αυτο ου κατε ·

**English Translation**
And the light in the darkness shin[es] and the darkn[ess] it not overt[ook]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The conflict is immediate. The Light *phai* (shines)—the action is continuous. The *skotia* (darkness) is the realm devoid of this Life. The verb *kate* (from *katalambanō*) is negated: the darkness did not seize, grasp, or overcome it. The Light is unconquerable. Though the text is abbreviated, the theological force is undiminished: the darkness is an active agent trying to suppress the Light, yet it fails utterly against the present power of the Logos.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο ανθρω απεϲταλμε παρα ην ο αυτω ϊω ·

**English Translation**
Came into being [a man] sen[t] from [God?] was the [name] to him Jo[hn]

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sharp distinction is drawn here. The Logos *was* (ēn), but John *egeneto* (came into being). The man is *apestalme* (sent), a man under orders. The text is rugged, omitting the Divine Name *Theou* after *para* (from), yet the source of the mission is implied. The name is given as *Iō* (John). He is a creature, a derivative being, contrasting sharply with the eternal existence of the Word. He appears on the stage of history as a messenger, not the message itself.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ ηλθεν ειϲ μαρτυ μαρτυ περι του φω · ϊνα παντεϲ πιϲτευϲωϲιν δι αυτου ·

**English Translation**
This one came for witn[ess] witn[ess] concerning the lig[ht]; that all might believe through him

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The purpose of the Forerunner is singular. The scribe writes *marty* twice—whether a slip of the pen or an emphatic stutter, it underscores the role: Witness. He is not the Light (*pho*); he is *peri* (concerning) the Light. The goal is universal: *hina pantes* (that all). Faith is the intended mechanism, mediated *di autou* (through him), that is, through his testimony. The witness is the bridge between the darkness of men and the Light of the Word.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ουκ ην εκι το φωϲ αλ ϊνα μαρτυρηϲη περι του φωτοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Not was th[at one] the light but that he might testify concerning the light

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A necessary negation to prevent idolatry. *Eki* (that one, John) was *not* the Light. In our zeal for the saints, we must not confuse the lamp with the Sun. His entire existence is functional: *hina martyrēsē* (in order that he might testify). He exists to point away from himself. The syntax isolates John from the ontology of the Light; he is distinct, a voice crying out, but not the Word that speaks existence.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ην το φωϲ το α · ο φω παντα αν ερχο ειϲ τον κοϲμον ·

**English Translation**
Was the light the t[rue]; which ligh[tens] every m[an] com[ing] into the world

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Logos is identified as *to phōs to a*—the True Light (*alethinon*). This distinguishes Him from all shadows, types, or lesser luminaries. The participial construction *ercho* (coming) is ambiguous in the Greek—does it refer to the man or the Light? Theologically, it is the Light coming into the world that enlightens (*phō*) every man (*an*). No human soul is left without the imprint of this illumination. It is an intrusive, pervasive Light that enters the *kosmon*, the ordered world of men.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
εν τω κοϲμω ην · και ο κοϲμοϲ δι αυ αυτου εγενετο και ο κοϲμοϲ αυτ ουκ εγνω

**English Translation**
In the world he was; and the world through hi[m] him came into being and the world hi[m] not knew

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tragedy of the Incarnation is etched here. He was *in* the world—the very sphere He created. The scribe stutters *di au autou* (through him him), emphasizing the agency of creation. The world owes its existence to Him (*egeneto*), yet the result is ignorance: *ouk egnō* (knew him not). The creation fails to recognize its Creator. This is the blindness of the darkness mentioned earlier; the Maker stands amidst His works, and His works treat Him as a stranger.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ειϲ τα ϊδια ηλθεν · και οι ϊδιοι αυτον ου παρελαβον ·

**English Translation**
Into the own things he came; and the own people him not received

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The intimacy of the rejection deepens. He did not merely visit a foreign land; He came *eis ta idia*—to His own home, His own possession. Yet, *hoi idioi*—His own family, His own people—did not *parelabon* (receive Him alongside). It is not active hostility here, but a refusal of welcome. The tragedy is domestic; the Master of the house returns, and the servants bar the door.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
οϲοι δε ελαβον αυτον · εδωκεν αυτοιϲ εξουϲιαν τεκνα γενεϲθε · τοιϲ πιϲτευουϲ ειϲ το ονομα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
But as many as received him; he gave to them authority children to become; to the ones believ[ing] into the name of him

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great reversal. To the remnant who *elabon* (received) Him, a new status is granted. He gives *exousian*—right, authority, privilege. The text reads *tekna genesthe* (children to become), omitting the genitive "of God" found in other traditions, yet the implication is adoption into the divine family. This transformation is not by blood, but for *tois pisteuous* (the ones believing) *eis to onoma* (into the name). Belief is motion; one believes *into* His name, entering the reality of the Logos. The rejection of the many highlights the glory of the few who become children.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
οι ουκ εξ αιματ · ουδε εκ θελημα ϲαρκοϲ · ουδε εκ θεληματοϲ ανδροϲ . αλλ εκ εγεννη

**English Translation**
who not of blood[s], nor of will of flesh, nor of will of man, but of [?] were bo...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the negation of human origin. The text reads *ex haimat* (of blood), truncated yet plural in implication, denying the hereditary claims of the tribes. It rejects the *thelema* (will) of the flesh and of the male (`ανδροϲ`). But look how the sentence culminates: *all ek egenne* ("but of... were born"). The Scribe halts before naming the Divine Source, leaving *ek* (out of) hanging in the air. This silence is theological; the birth from God is ineffable. We are born not of the will of man, but of a Source so holy the text itself trembles and falls silent before the Name.

**Verse 14**


**Greek Text**
και ο λογοϲ ‾‾ ϲαρξ εγενετο και εϲκηνωϲεν εν η εν ημιν · και εθεαϲα την δοξ αυτου · δοξαν · ωϲ μονογενουϲ πα πατροϲ πληρηϲ χαριτοϲ και αληθιαϲ ˙

**English Translation**
And the Word became flesh and tabernacled in u... in us; and [we] beheld his glor... glory, as of an only-begotten from fa... father, full of grace and truth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Scribe struggles under the weight of the mystery! See the stuttering: *en he... en hemin* ("in u... in us"). It is as if the pen cannot believe that the infinite Logos pitched His tent within our frailty. Again, *dox... doxan* ("glor... glory") and *pa... patros* ("fa... father"). The text corrects itself, striving for precision in the face of the Uncontainable. Note that *pleres* (full) is nominative, referring back to the *Logos*, not the Father. It is the Incarnate Word who is the vessel of this fullness, overflowing into the broken syntax of human speech.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ϊωαννηϲ μαρτυρι περι αυτου και κε λεγων ουτοϲ ην ο ειπων ον ειπων ονʼ ειπον ο οπιϲω μου ερ οϲ εμ μου γε οτι πρωτοϲ μου ην

**English Translation**
John testifies concerning him and cri... saying: This was the one saying whom saying whom I said: The one com... after me, who be... me be... because he was first of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A chaotic witness for a tumultuous time. The text reads *ke*—likely *kekragen* (cries out)—but it is cut short, a sharp shout in the wilderness. Then, the confusion of the scribe: *ho eipon on eipon on eipon* ("the one saying whom saying whom I said"). It mimics the relentless, repetitive proclamation of the Baptist, a voice echoing off the canyon walls. The theology, however, stands firm amidst the scribal wreckage: *protos mou en* ("he was first of me"). The temporal priority of the Pre-existent One is asserted even when the grammar of the forerunner collapses.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
οτι εκ του πληρωματοϲ αυ ημειϲ παντεϲ ελαβομεν · και χα αντι χαριτοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Because out of his fullness we all received, and gra... in place of grace.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the economy of salvation. *Pleromatos* (fullness) is the source. But notice the truncation: *cha anti charitos*. The word *charin* (grace) is cut to *cha*. It is as if one grace is given and immediately replaced by another before the word can even be finished. It is a torrent of divine favor, wave upon wave (`αντι χαριτοϲ`), too fast for the hand of the writer to capture fully. We receive from a fullness that breaks the boundaries of the page.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ὁτι ο νομοϲ δια μωϋϲεωϲ εδοθη · η χαριϲ και η αληθι δια εγενετο ˙

**English Translation**
Because the law was given through Moses; grace and tru... came to be through...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A stark contrast. The Law *edothe* (was given)—a passive gift, a fixed deposit. But Grace and Truth *egeneto* (came to be)—a living, dynamic reality entering history. The text ends abruptly: *dia egeneto* ("through... came to be"). The name "Jesus Christ" is absent in this line! Yet, the Bishop sees this not as lack, but as presence. The Agent of Grace is so central He need not be named; He is the silent Subject of all true existence. The Law has a name (Moses); Grace has a Being.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
· ουδειϲ εωρα πωποτε ο μο ο ων ειϲ τ κολπον του πα εκεινοϲ εξη ˙

**English Translation**
No one has seen [God] ever; the on... the one being in the bosom of the fa..., that one decl...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The apophatic vision. *Oudeis heora* (no one has seen). The object is missing—God is invisible, even grammatically. The text stumbles at the revelation of the Son: *ho mo... ho on* ("the on... the one being"). Is it *monogenes*? The scribe hesitates at the mystery of the eternal generation. He is in the *kolpon* (bosom) of the *pa* (Father, truncated). And finally, *ekeinos exe*—He "declared" or "exegeted" Him. The verb is unfinished (*exe*). The exegesis of the Father by the Son is an eternal act, never concluded in time.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και αυτη εϲτιν η μαρτυρι του ϊωαννου οτε απεϲτιλαν οι ϊου εξ ϊεροϲολυ · και λευ · ϊνα επερω αυτον ϲυ τιϲ ει ˙

**English Translation**
And this is the testimony of John when the Je... sent from Jerusale... and Lev... in order to a... him: Who are you?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inquisition begins. The *Iou* (Jews) and *Leu* (Levites) are sent from *Ierosoly* (Jerusalem). These abbreviations reduce the authorities to mere titles, stripped of their grandeur. They come *hina epero* (in order to ask/interrogate). The question is sharp and unabbreviated: *Sy tis ei* ("Who are you?"). In the face of the Word, the world demands identity, while the religious authorities are reduced to fragments of their former power.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
και ωμολογη και ουκ ηρνη · οτι εγω ουκ ι ο ·

**English Translation**
And he confessed and did not den...: that I am not the...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The confession of the Baptist is defined by what he is *not*. *Ouk herne* (did not deny). His statement is cut to the bone: *ego ouk i o* ("I am not the..."). He does not even pronounce the title "Christ." It is a humility so profound that he refuses to complete the sentence that would place him in the Messiah's shadow. He is the voice of negation clearing the way for the Affirmation.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
και ‾̷‾ επηρω ηρωτηϲαν ηρωτηϲαν αυτον παλιν · τι ο ηλιαϲ ει · λεγει ου ειμι · ο προφητηϲ ει ϲυ · και απεκριθη ου ˙

**English Translation**
And... ask... asked asked him again: What? Are you Elias? He says: I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered: No.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text preserves the harassment of the saint. *Epero erotesan erotesan*—a triple stutter of "asking." They badger him. "Are you Elias?" His answer is *Ou eimi* (I am not). "Are you the prophet?" His answer is simply *Ou* (No). As the questions pile up, John's answers become shorter. He decreases, that the One coming may increase. He has no desire to converse with the idle curiosity of the *Ierosoly*.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ουν αυτω · τιϲ ει · ϊνα αποκρι δωμεν τοιϲ πεμψαϲιν ημαϲ · τι λεγειϲ περι ϲεαυ ·

**English Translation**
They said therefore to him: Who are you? In order that we might give an ans... to those having sent us. What do you say concerning yoursel...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inquisitors are desperate for a category. They need an *apokri* (answer/decision) to satisfy their masters. They ask, "What do you say concerning *seau* (yourself)?" This is the error of the world: to focus on the self. John has no "self" to preach; he is a voice for the Other. The truncation of *seautou* implies that John's "self" is indeed cut off, irrelevant to his mission.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
εφη · εγω φω βοωντοϲ εν τη ερημω · ευθυ την οδον καθωϲ ειπεν ηϲα ο προφητηϲ : ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
He said: I [am] the voi... of one crying in the desert: Make strai... the way [?], just as Isa... the prophet said.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John defines himself as sound, not substance. *Ego pho* (I am a voice/sound). He is the *pho* of the *Logos*. His command is *euthu* (make straight). But look: *ten hodon* (the way) stands without the usual qualifier "of the Lord." The text ends the quote there. The Way is absolute. It is not just the Lord's way; it is *The Way*. The reference to *Hesa* (Isaiah) grounds this new revelation in the ancient groaning of the prophets.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
και οι απεϲταλμε · ηϲαν εκ των φαριϲαιων ·

**English Translation**
And the sent on... were from the Pharisees.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A final, ominous note. *Hoi apestalme* (the sent ones). They are emissaries of a rigid system. They are *ek ton Pharisaion* (out of the Pharisees). While John is "out of the desert" and the believers are "born out of God" (v.13), these men are born "out of the Pharisees." Their origin dictates their blindness. They see the law, but they cannot read the *pho* (voice) crying in the wilderness.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
και ει αυτω · τι ουν βαπτιζειϲ · ει ϲυ ου ει ο · ουδε ηλι ουδε ο προφη :

**English Translation**
And [they said] to him: Why then do you baptize, if you are not the [Christ], nor Eli[jah], nor the proph[et]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the interrogation of the priesthood. They recognize three authorities for the eschatological washing: the Anointed One (*Christos*), the Tishbite who returns (*Elijah*), or the Prophet foretold by Moses. By asking "Why then do you baptize?" they accuse John of liturgical innovation without divine sanction. They seek to bind the grace of water to specific offices, yet they fail to see that the authority stands before them in the wilderness, not in their titles.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτοιϲ ὁ ϊωαννηϲ λεγ · εγω βαπτιζω εν τω ϋδατι · μεϲοϲ ϋμων εϲτηκει ον ϋμειϲ ουκ οιδατε ·

**English Translation**
John answered them saying: I baptize in the water; [but] in the midst of you stands [one] whom you do not know;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John confesses the limit of his economy: he possesses the element (*water*), but not the Spirit-fire. The tragedy of Israel is revealed in the phrase *mesos hymōn* (in the midst of you). The Logos is omnipresent and physically near, standing among His own people, yet remains recognized only by the humble. The blindness of the inquirers is total; they look for a distant messiah while the Reality stands within their gathering.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ο οπιϲω μου ερχομε ου ουκ ειμι α λυϲω αυ τον ϊμαντα του :

**English Translation**
The [one] coming after me, of whom I am not w[orthy] to untie the strap of the[...];

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the perfection of humility. The Forerunner declares himself unworthy (*axios*) to perform the task of the lowest slave—the loosening of the sandal. If the greatest of those born of women is not fit to touch the foot of the Incarnate Word, how much more must we approach the Divine Mysteries with trembling? The text implies the sandal of the *hypodēmatos*, symbolizing the flesh which the Word has put on, a mystery John dares not unravel.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα εγενετο εν βηθανια βηθαραβα περαν του ποταμου : οπου ην ο ϊωαν βαπτιζων ·

**English Translation**
These things happened in Bethany Betharaba beyond the river, where John was baptizing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex preserves a double naming, *Bethany Betharaba*, indicating a specific locus of history. It is "beyond the river," signifying a place of crossing over. Just as Joshua led the people across the waters, John prepares the new Israel at the boundary. The geography is not accidental; it is the wilderness where the voice cries out, far from the corruptions of the city.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
τη επαυριον βλεπι τον ερχομεν προϲ αυτον και λε · ϊδε ο αμνοϲ του ο ερων την α του κοϲμου ˙

**English Translation**
On the morrow he looks at the [one] coming to him and says: See, the Lamb of [God], the [one] taking the s[in] of the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the theology of the Atonement in a single gaze (*blepei*). He does not call Him King or Judge, but *Amnos* (Lamb). The singular *hamartian* (sin) is used, not the plural; for Christ does not merely remove individual offenses, but lifts the entire ontological weight of the world's rebellion. He is the Paschal victim provided by God (*tou theou*), replacing all shadows of the Law.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ εϲτιν περι ου εγω ειπον οπιϲω μου ερχεται ανηρ · οϲʼ εμπροϲθεν μου γεγονεν · οτι πρω μου ην ·

**English Translation**
This is [he] concerning whom I said: After me comes a man who has become before me, because he was fi[rst] of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A paradox of time and eternity. In the flesh, Jesus comes *opisō* (after) John; in dignity and divinity, He *emprosthen* (has become before); in eternal generation, He *prōtos* (was first). John acknowledges the pre-existence of the Logos. The "man" (*anēr*) is the Eternal Son who precedes his own herald.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
καγω ου ηδειν αυτον · αλ ϊνα φανερωθη τω ι ι · δια τουτο ηλ εγω εν ϋδατι βαπτιζων

**English Translation**
And I did not know him; but that he might be made manifest to I[srael], for this reason I ca[me] baptizing in water.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The purpose of the Baptist's mission is *phanerōsis*—manifestation. The water is not for the remission of sins in the absolute sense, which belongs to the Cross, but a stage for the revealing of the Messiah to Israel (*I[sraēl]*). John's ignorance ("I did not know him") confirms that this revelation is not of flesh and blood, nor of kinship, but of divine disclosure.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
και ε ϊω λεγων οτι τεθε το π ωϲ περιϲτεραν · κατα εκ του ου και μεν μεν επ αυτον ·

**English Translation**
And Jo[hn] testi[fied] saying that: I have ga[zed at] the S[pirit] as a dove descen[ding] out of hea[ven], and it rem[ained] upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The vision is Trinitarian. The Spirit (*Pneuma*) descends as a dove—gentle, pure, and bringing peace like the olive branch to Noah. The crucial verb is *emeinen* (remained). On the prophets, the Spirit came and went; on the Son, the Spirit rests eternally and hypostatically. The descent from heaven (*ouranou*) bridges the chasm between God and man.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
και εγω ουκ ηδειν αυτον · αλλ ο πεμψαϲ με βαπτιζειν εν τω ϋδατι · εκινοϲ μοι ειπεν · εφ ον αν ϊ το π καταβαι και μενον ε αυτον · ουτοϲ ε ο βαπτιζων εν π αγιω ·

**English Translation**
And I did not know him; but the [one] having sent me to baptize in the water, that one said to me: Upon whomsoever you s[ee] the S[pirit] descend[ing] and remaining o[n] him, this i[s] the [one] baptizing in [the] Holy S[pirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mandate is from the Father ("the one having sent me"). The sign is the abiding Spirit. Here is the distinction of baptisms: John's is of water, a preparation; Christ's is of the Holy Spirit (*Pneuma Hagion*), a regeneration. The water washes the body; the Spirit recreates the soul. John is the servant of the element; Christ is the Lord of the Essence.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
καγω εωρακα και με · οτι ου εϲτιν ο εκλεκτοϲ του :

**English Translation**
And I have seen and testi[fied] that th[is] is the Chosen of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Attend closely to the reading of the Codex: *ho eklektos* (the Chosen One). While other texts may read "Son," this manuscript emphasizes His unique Election. He is the Isaiahic Servant, the Elect in whom the Father delights. John's testimony is empirical ("I have seen") and juridical ("I have testified"). He is the witness for the prosecution against the world's unbelief.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
τη επαυριον · παλ ϊϲτηκι ο ϊωαννηϲ και εκ των μαθη αυτου δυο ·

**English Translation**
On the morrow again John sto[od], and two from his disci[ples].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scene shifts "on the morrow." John stands (*histēkei*), indicating his role as a pillar that is now stationary, waiting to point the way. He is not alone; he has prepared disciples not for himself, but to be handed over. The true teacher gathers students only to give them to the Master.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
και εμβλεψαϲ τω πε λεγει · ϊδε ο αμνοϲ του ˙

**English Translation**
And having looked at [Jesus] walk[ing], he says: See, the Lamb of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The gaze (*emblepsas*) is fixed on the movement of God. As Jesus walks (*peripatounti*), sanctifying the earth with His steps, John repeats the essential dogma: *Ide ho Amnos* (See the Lamb). He offers no new teaching, only the repetition of the central mystery. To see the Lamb is the beginning of discipleship; to follow Him is the end of the Law.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ηκουϲαν οι δυο μα αυτου λαλο · και ηκολουθη τω :

**English Translation**
And the two disciples heard him speaking; and they followed the [one].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the economy of the Spirit: the Baptist speaks, and the disciples move. The text abbreviates *mathētai* (disciples) to *ma*, just as the disciples themselves diminish to make room for the Master. They heard him *lalo* (speaking)—the voice of the friend of the Bridegroom gives way to the Bridegroom himself. They "followed the..."—the sentence hangs, the object implied, for to whom else would the seeking soul go? It is the transition from the Law's preparation to Grace's reality.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ϲτραφειϲ δε ο και θεα αυτουϲ ακολουθουνταϲ λε αυτοιϲ · τι ζητειτε · οι δε ειπον αυτω · ραββει · ο λεγεται ερμηνευ μεθερμηνευομενον διδαϲκα · που μενειϲ ·

**English Translation**
But having turned, the [Jesus] and having beheld them following, says to them: What seek ye? But they said to him: Rabbi (which is called, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest thou?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Divine Word turns (*strapheis*) to face humanity. He asks not for information, for He knows all, but to probe the will: "What seek ye?" He does not ask "Whom," but "What," searching the intent of the heart. They respond with *Rabbi*, acknowledging authority, but their question "Where abidest thou?" (*pou meneis*) betrays a desire not for a lecture, but for a dwelling-place, a permanent communion with God.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
λε αυτοιϲ ερχεϲθε και ϊδετε · ηλθον ουν · και ϊδον που μαινει · και παρ αυ εμιναν την η εκεινην · ωρα ην ωϲ δεκατη :

**English Translation**
He says to them: Come and see. They came therefore; and saw where he abides; and with him they remained that day; the hour was about tenth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"Come and see." Faith is not abstract speculation but empirical encounter. The scribe writes *mainei* (abides) and *eminan* (remained), emphasizing the stability of this union. It was the "tenth hour"—two hours before sunset. The day of the Old Covenant was fading; the new day of the Lord was beginning. They rested with Him in the spiritual evening of the world.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ην ανδρεαϲ ο αδελ ϲιμωνοϲ πε ειϲ εκ των δυ των ακουϲαντων πα ϊωαννου · και ακολουθηϲαντ αυτω :

**English Translation**
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two having heard from John and having followed him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Andrew is identified by his relation to Peter (*Simōnos Pe*), yet he precedes Peter in time. He is the *Protokletos* (First-Called). He heard "from John" (*pa Iōannou*)—the preposition *para* indicating the source. The stream of the Baptist flows into the ocean of Christ. He followed not merely physically, but with the obedience of the soul.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ευριϲκει ουτοϲ πρω πρωτον τον αδελφον τον ϊδιον ϲιμωνα και λεγει αυτω . ευ τον μεϲ · ο εϲτιν με ·

**English Translation**
This one finds first his own brother Simon and says to him: We have found the Messiah; which is [interpreted]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stammers *prō prōton* (first, first), perhaps trembling at the magnitude of the discovery. The first act of the called is to call others. "We have found" (*eurēkamen*, abbreviated *eu*)—the plural indicates the shared joy of the Church in embryo. He uses the Hebrew *Mes* (Messiah), preserving the ancient hope, before the text moves to interpret it for the nations.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
ηγαγεν αυτον προϲ τον · εμβλεψαϲ αυτω ο ειπεν · ϲυ ει ϲι ο υϊοϲ ϊωαν · ϲυ κληθηϲη κηφαϲ · ο ερμηνευ πετροϲ ˙

**English Translation**
He led him to the [Jesus]. Having looked at him, the [Jesus] said: Thou art Simon the son of John; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Andrew leads, but Christ defines. The Lord "looked at him" (*emblepsas*)—a gaze that penetrates to the ontological core. He names the present reality ("Thou art Simon") and the future destiny ("Thou shalt be called Cephas"). The Aramaic *Kephas* becomes the Greek *Petros*. The shifting sand of Simon becomes the rock of the Church; grace transforms nature.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
τη επαυριον ηθε εξελθιν ειϲ την γαλιλαιαν · και ευριϲκει φιλιππ φιλιππ και λεγει αυτω ο · ακολουθι μοι ·

**English Translation**
On the morrow he wished to go forth into Galilee; and he finds Philip and the [Jesus] says to him: Follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the initiative is solely the Lord's: *ēthelēsen* (he wished). The scribe repeats *philipp* twice, marking the moment of election. Unlike the previous two who sought Him, Christ seeks Philip. The command is absolute: *akolouthi moi* (follow me). It is the royal summons of the King to his subject, requiring immediate abandonment of the former life.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
δε ο φιλιπποϲ απο βηθ βηθϲαϊδα τηϲ εκ τηϲ τηϲ πολε ανδρεου και πε ·

**English Translation**
Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stutters on *Bēth Bēthsaida* and *tēs ek tēs tēs poleōs* (of the, of the, of the city), emphasizing the specific locality. Bethsaida, the "House of Fishing," is the nursery of the Apostles. God uses the bonds of locality and kinship—Andrew, Peter, and Philip share a city—to knit together the net of the Kingdom.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
ευριϲκει φι τον ναθα · και λεγει αυτω · ον εγραψεν μωϲηϲ εν τω νομω · και οι προφηται · ευρη του ϊωϲηφʼ τον απο ναζαρετ ˙

**English Translation**
Philip finds Nathanael and says to him: Him whom Moses wrote of in the law, and the prophets, we have found, the [son] of Joseph, the one from Nazareth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Philip acts as a theologian, linking the new experience to the ancient *Nomos* (Law). He identifies Jesus by his earthly veil: "of Joseph, from Nazareth." He sees the fulfillment of Moses and the Prophets, yet his vision is still tethered to the fleshly lineage. He has found the Pearl, though the shell (Nazareth) seems common to him.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν αυτω ναθαναηλ : εκ ναζαρετ δυνα αγαθον τι τι αγαθον ειναι · λεγει αυτω φιλιπ ερχου και ϊδε ·

**English Translation**
Nathanael said to him: Out of Nazareth can there be any good thing? Philip says to him: Come and see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nathanael speaks from the prejudice of the learned; how can the King come from a despised village? The repetition *ti ti agathon* (any, any good) heightens the skepticism. Philip does not argue dialectically. He repeats the Master's formula from verse 39: *erchou kai ide* (come and see). The cure for intellectual pride is personal encounter with the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ϊδων ϊδον ϊδεν ο τον να ερχομε προϲ αυτον κ(αι) λεγει περι του να αυτου ϊδε αλη ϊϲδραηλειτηϲ εν ω δολοϲ ουκ ε ·

**English Translation**
Seeing [Jesus] Nathanael coming toward him, and he says concerning him: Behold, truly an Israelite in whom guile is not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles mightily—*idōn idon iden*—grappling with the act of divine sight. Christ sees the interior man. He calls Nathanael a "true Israelite," contrasting him with the first Israel (Jacob) who was a supplanter full of guile. Here is a soul transparent before God, seeking truth without the mask of hypocrisy (*dolos*).

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ναθαναηλ ποθ με γινωϲκειϲ απεκριθη ο και ειπεν αυτω · προ του ϲε φιλιππον φωνηϲαι οντα ϋπο την ϲυκην · ϊδον ϲε ·

**English Translation**
Nathanael says to him: Whence knowest thou me? The [Jesus] answered and said to him: Before Philip called thee, being under the fig tree, I saw thee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nathanael is startled by being known (*ginōskeis*). Christ reveals His pre-existence and omnipresence. To be "under the fig tree" is the posture of the student of the Law, hidden from the world but naked before God. Christ saw him in his solitude before the human call reached him. The divine election precedes the human vocation; He loved us before we knew Him.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ναθα και ειπεν · ραββει · ϲυ ει ο του · ϲυ ει ο βαϲιλευϲ του ι ι

**English Translation**
Answered Natha[nael] and said: Rabbi; You are the [Son] of the [God]; You are the King of I[srael].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the breathless haste of the confession, captured even in the scribe’s contractions. The text reads *Natha*, cutting short the name of the disciple as if his spirit rushes ahead of his tongue. More profound is the elliptical declaration *sy ei ho tou* ("You are the [One] of the [One]"). The scribe has omitted the nouns *Son* and *God*, leaving only the articles. Is this mere error? Or does it unwittingly confess the apophatic mystery? Christ is the absolute "Of the," the Relation Incarnate, deriving His being from the Father in a manner beyond written speech. The stuttering *tou i i* at the end—likely for *Israel*—echoes the trembling of the patriarch Jacob, whose name became Israel, now fulfilled in the presence of the true King.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ει αυτω · οτι ειπ ειπ ϲοι οτι ειδον ϲε ϋ τηϲ ϲυκηϲ πιϲτευειϲ · μειζο τουτων οψη ·

**English Translation**
Answered [Jesus] and s[aid] to him: Because I said, I said to you that I saw you u[nder] the fig tree, you believe? Greater [things] than these you shall see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here stammers with divine certainty: *eip eip* ("I said, I said"). The Lord emphasizes the veracity of His previous word. The preposition *hypo* (under) is reduced to a single character *ϋ*, suggesting the hiddenness of Nathanael beneath the leaves, a concealment that was no barrier to the eye of the Word. The Lord asks, "You believe?" not to doubt the disciple's faith, but to expand his capacity. If a mere earthly sight—a body under a tree—elicits such faith, how much more the spiritual realities to come? The promise *meizo* (greater things) prepares the soul for the vision of the opened heaven, moving from the shade of the fig (the old law) to the light of the new vision.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυτω αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν · οψεϲθαι τ ουρανον ηνεω ανεωγοτα · και τουϲ αγ του α κ(αι) καταβαινονταϲ επι τον του αν ·

**English Translation**
And He says to him: Amen, amen I say to you: You shall see the heaven o[pened] opened; and the ang[els] of the G[od] [ascending] and descending upon the [Son] of M[an].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the seal of the chapter. The double *Amen* anchors the prophecy. Note the scribe’s struggle with the opening of the heavens: *heneo aneogota*. He begins the word, falters, and then completes the perfect participle *aneogota*. It is as if the heavens are being torn open in the very act of writing. We see *tous ag tou a*—the "ang[els] of G[od]" (where *Alpha* stands for the Divine Source)—moving upon *ton tou an*, "the [Son] of M[an]." The text is radically compressed; the "ascending" is implied or lost in the abbreviation *k(ai)*, leaving the focus on the *descending*. This is fitting for the Incarnation: the emphasis is not on man climbing to God, but on the Angels and the Grace coming down upon the Son of Man, who is the Ladder established on earth.
