**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϋ ο μη ειϲερχο δια τηϲ θυ ειϲ την αυλην των προβατων · αλλα αναβαινων αλλαχοθεν · εκει κλεπτηϲ εϲτ εϲτ και ληϲτηϲ ·

**English Translation**
Amen amen I say to [you], the [one] not entering through the door into the courtyard of the sheep, but going up from elsewhere, that one is is a thief and a robber.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the solemnity of the double affirmation, *Amen amen*. The Lord distinguishes the lawful entry from the illicit ascent. The true shepherd uses the *thyras* (door); the false one climbs "from elsewhere," bypassing the ordained threshold. Note the scribal repetition *est est* ("is is"); the text itself stammers to emphasize the undeniable reality of this intruder's nature. He is doubly defined: a thief who acts by stealth, and a robber who acts by violence.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ει δια τηϲ θυραϲ · ποιμ εϲτιν των προβα ·

**English Translation**
But the [one] entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Simplicity marks the legitimate ruler of the flock. There is no climbing, no subterfuge. The abbreviation *poim* (shepherd) stands in stark contrast to the thief of the previous verse. The authority of the shepherd is proven not by force, but by the manner of his entrance: he possesses the right to the door.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
τουτω ο θυρω ανυγει · και τα προβατα τηϲ φω αυτου ακουει · και τα ϊδια προβα φωνει κατ ονο · και εξαγει αυτα

**English Translation**
To this one the doorkeeper opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and the own sheep he calls by name; and leads them out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See the hierarchy of the sheepfold: the *thyroros* (doorkeeper) recognizes the shepherd. There is a mutual recognition: the keeper opens, and the sheep listen. The text emphasizes intimacy with the phrase *kat onoma* (by name). He does not drive them as a herd of anonymous beasts but calls them as individual souls. He *exagei* (leads them out)—salvation is a movement from the confinement of the fold to the liberty of the pasture.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
οταν τα ϊδια παντα εκβα εμπροϲθεν αυτων πορευεται · και τα προβατα αυτω ακολουθι ˙ ο οιδαϲιν την φω αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Whenever the own [sheep] all he puts forth, before them he goes; and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The shepherd assumes the position of danger and leadership: *emprosthen* (before them). He does not drive from behind with a whip but draws them forward with his presence. The obedience of the flock is rooted in knowledge (*oidasin*), not coercion. They follow because they recognize the *phonen* (voice) that speaks truth, distinct from the cacophony of the world.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
αλλοτρι δε ου μη ακολου · αλλα φευ απ αυτου · οτι ουκ οιδαϲι τ αλλοτριων την φωνην ·

**English Translation**
But a stranger they will by no means follow; but will flee from him; because they do not know the voice of the strangers.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The instinct of the faithful soul is rejection of the *allotrio* (alien/stranger). The Greek employs the double negative *ou me* (by no means), indicating the impossibility of true sheep following a heretic. Their reaction is flight (*pheuxontai*). Ignorance here is a virtue: they "do not know" the voice of error, for their ears are tuned only to the frequency of the Truth.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ταυτην την παροιμιαν ειπεν αυτοιϲ ο και εκινοι δε ουκ εγνωϲαν τινα ην · ἁ ελαλει αυτοιϲ ·

**English Translation**
This proverb the [Jesus] spoke to them; but those ones did not know what it was which he was speaking to them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks in a *paroimian*—a figure or proverb—yet the audience is seized by a spiritual stupor. The text reads "the [Jesus]... and those ones," highlighting the chasm between the Speaker and the hearers. They heard the audible words but lacked the interior illumination to grasp "what it was." Revelation requires not just a speaking God, but a hearing heart.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυ παλιν παλιν ουν αυτοιϲ ουν αυτοιϲ παλιν ο αμ αμ αμην λεγω · οτι εγω ειμι η θυ των προβατ προβατ ·

**English Translation**
He said therefore to [them] again again therefore to them therefore to them again the [Jesus]: Amen amen amen I say: that I am the door of the sheep sheep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the turbulence in the text! The scribe writes "again" and "therefore" repeatedly, and "Amen" three times, and "sheep" twice. It is as if the parchment itself trembles under the weight of the clarification. Faced with their ignorance (Verse 6), the Lord—and the text—stammers with emphatic repetition. He abandons the third-person parable for the direct *Ego eimi* (I am). He is not merely the shepherd; He is the *Thyra* (Door) itself, the sole means of access to the Father.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
παντεϲ οϲοι ηλθ προ εμου κλεπται ειϲιν και ληϲται · αλλ ουκ η αυτων τα προβατα ·

**English Translation**
All as many as came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sweeping judgment upon all false messiahs and self-appointed prophets who came *pro emou* (before Me) without divine commission. They are ontologically thieves. Yet, the validation of the elect is preserved: "the sheep did not hear them." The true flock possesses a divine deafness to error, a safeguard against the "thieves and robbers" who seek to usurp the fold.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
εγω η ειμι η θυρα · δι εμου εαν τιϲ ειϲελθη ϲωθηϲεται · και ει και εξελευϲεται · και νομην ευρηϲει ·

**English Translation**
I [am] am the door; through me if anyone enters he shall be saved; and shall go in and shall go out; and pasture shall find.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition "I am am" reinforces the divine claim. Salvation is strictly prepositional: *di emou* (through Me). The result of this entry is threefold: salvation (*sothesetai*), liberty ("go in and go out"), and sustenance ("find pasture"). The Christian life is not imprisonment in the fold, but a protected freedom to traverse the spiritual realms under the Door's authority.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ο κλεπτηϲ · ουκ ερ · ει μη ϊνα κλεψη και θυϲη και απολεϲη · εγω ηλθον · ϊνα ζω ζω αιωνιον εχωϲ · και περιϲϲον ε ·

**English Translation**
The thief comes not except that he might steal and kill and destroy; I came that they might have life life eternal; and abundantly have.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The contrast is absolute. The thief's trinity of action is stealing, killing, destroying. The Lord's purpose is life. Note the Sinaiticus reading here: it repeats *zoen* (life life) and explicitly adds *aionion* (eternal), which is often absent in other witnesses of this specific verse. The Codex insists that the life Christ brings is not merely biological, but *eternal* and abundant (*perisson*).

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
εγω ειμι ο ποιμην ο καλοϲ · ο ποιμην ο καλοϲ την ψυχην αυτου διδωϲιν τιθηϲιν τ προβατων ·

**English Translation**
I am the shepherd the good; the shepherd the good his life gives lays down for the sheep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the text presents a profound conflation: *didosin* (gives) and *tithesin* (lays down). The scribe preserves both verbs, perhaps unsure, yet theologically both are true. The Good Shepherd *gives* His life as a gift, and *lays it down* as a deliberate, priestly sacrifice. He is not a victim of circumstance, but the active agent of redemption for the *probaton* (sheep).

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ο δε μι και ουκ ποιμην · οὑ · ουκ ε τα προβατα ϊ θεωρι τον λυ ερχομενον και αφιηϲιν τα προ και φευγει · και ο λυκοϲ αρπα αυτα και ϲκορ ·

**English Translation**
But the hireling and not being shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholds the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *misthotos* (hireling) is defined by what he lacks: he is "not shepherd" and the sheep are "not own" to him. His motivation is wage, not love. Consequently, when the *lykon* (wolf) appears—the heretic or the demon—he abandons the charge. The result of pastoral cowardice is the *skorpizei* (scattering) of the flock. Unity requires a shepherd who owns the sheep; the hireling ensures only fragmentation.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
οτι μιϲθω εϲτιν και ου μελει αυτω περι των προβατων ·

**English Translation**
...because he is [a] hireling and there is no care to him concerning the sheep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the cold logic of the mercenary spirit. The scribe preserves the blunt accusation: *misthō* (hireling). The defect of the hireling is not merely his wage, but his affection; the text reads *ou melei autō*—literally, "it is not a care to him." Where love is absent, the flock is commodified. The true Shepherd defends with his blood; the hireling calculates his risk and flees, for his bond to the sheep is forged in gold, not in spirit.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
εγω ειμι ο ποιμ ποιμ ο καλοϲ · και γει τα εμα ˙ κ(αι) γεινωϲκουϲι με τα εμα ·

**English Translation**
I am the shep[herd] shepherd the good; and I kn[ow] mine, and mine know me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stammers here—*poim poim*—as if the scribe trembled before the magnitude of the title. "I am the Shepherd, the Good." Note the reciprocity in the abbreviated *gei* (know) and *geinōskousi* (they know). It is not a knowledge of intellect, but of intimacy. As the seal fits the wax, so the Shepherd knows the contours of his own, and the sheep, by instinct of grace, recognize the imprint of their Master.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
καθωϲ γι με ο πατηρ · καγω γινωϲκω τον πατερα · και τ ψυχην μου διδω τιθημι ϋπερ των προ ·

**English Translation**
Just as the Father kn[ows] me, and I know the Father; and my l[ife] I give [lay down] on behalf of the sh[eep].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the deep theology of the Trinity woven into pastoral care. The mutual indwelling of Father and Son is the archetype for the union of Christ and the Church. The scribe struggles between *didō* (I give) and *tithēmi* (I lay down), preserving both or correcting one. This textual tension reveals a dual truth: it is a gift (*didō*) of grace, yet a deliberate, priestly placement (*tithēmi*) of his life upon the altar of the cross for the *pro* (sheep).

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και αλλα προβατα εχω · ἁ ουκ εϲτιν εκ τηϲ αυληϲ ταυτηϲ · κα δει με αγα · και τηϲ φω μου ακουϲω · και γενηϲε γενηϲ μια ποιμνη · ειϲ ποιμην ·

**English Translation**
And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; th[ose] also it behooves me to le[ad], and my vo[ice] they shall hear; and there shall be[come] one flock, one shepherd.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The horizon expands beyond Israel. *Kakeina* (those also) must be led. The imperative *dei* (it is necessary/it behooves) marks the divine compulsion of salvation history. The scribe’s stutter on *genēse genēs* (shall become) emphasizes the future certainty of this unity. It is not that they *are* one flock naturally, but they *shall become* one through the hearing of the *phō* (voice). The unity of the Church is forged not by walls, but by the one Shepherd.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
δια τουτο με ο πατηρ αγαπα · οτι εγω τι την ψυχην μου · ϊνα παλιν λαβω αυτην ·

**English Translation**
On account of this the Father loves me: because I la[y down] my life, in order that again I might take it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Father's love is here linked to the Son's obedience in death. The abbreviation *ti* stands for *tithēmi* (I place/lay down). But mark the purpose: *hina* (in order that). The death is not a defeat but a strategic descent intended to secure the ascent. He lays down the garment of flesh to take it up again, glorified, dragging humanity with him from the grave.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ου ηρεν ερει αυτην απ εμου · αλλ εγω τιθημι αυτην α εμαυτου · εξου εχω θειναι αυτην · και εξουϲι εχω παλιν · λα αυτην · ταυτ την εντολην ελα παρα του πα μου ·

**English Translation**
No one took [takes?] it from me, but I lay it down of myself; auth[ority] I have to lay it down, and authori[ty] I have again to ta[ke] it; th[is] commandment I rece[ived] from my Fa[ther].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound textual struggle exists here between *ēren* (took, aorist) and *erei* (shall take, future), suggesting the timeless nature of the sacrifice—it is never truly forced by man. The Lord claims absolute *exousia* (authority). He is the Priest and the Victim. The command comes from the *pa* (Father), proving that the Cross is not a rupture in the Trinity, but its supreme expression of united will.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ϲχιϲμα παλιν εγενετο εν τοιϲ δια τουϲ λογουϲ του

**English Translation**
A schism again occurred among the [Jews?] on account of th[ese] words.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Word of God is a sword that divides. *Schisma* (a rent or tear) appears again. The text is abrupt, omitting "Jews" (likely implied by *en tois*), focusing solely on the division caused by the *logous* (words). Truth does not always bring immediate peace; often, it first brings separation, tearing the fabric of false consensus.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ελεγαν ελεγον ουν δε ουν πολλοι εξ αυτ δαιμονιον εχει · και μαινεται · τι αυτου ακουεται ·

**English Translation**
They were sa[ying] therefore [but therefore] many of th[em]: A demon he has and is mad; why do you hear him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe fumbles with the conjunctions (*oun de oun*), reflecting the chaotic murmuring of the crowd. The accusation is blunt: *daimonion echei* (he has a demon). The carnal mind, confronted with divine mystery, retreats to slander. They equate the ecstasy of divine revelation with madness (*mainetai*). To the deaf, the music of heaven looks like insanity.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
αλλοι δε ελεγον · ταυτα τα ρηματα ου εϲτιν δαιμονι · μη δαι δυναται τυφλων οφθαλ ανυξαι :

**English Translation**
But others were saying: These words are not of a demon[iac]; [a] dem[on] is not able to op[en] eyes of blind men.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the apologetic of the faithful remnant. They argue from the fruit to the root. The *rhēmata* (utterances) and the works do not align with the chaotic nature of a *dai* (demon). The specific miracle—opening the *ophthal* (eyes) of the blind—is the seal of the Creator, not the destroyer. Light belongs to God; demons dwell in darkness.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε τα εν εν ϊεροϲο · χειμων ·

**English Translation**
Now it was the Ded[ication] in Jerusa[lem]; winter [it was].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is cryptic, *ta en en*, a stammering abbreviation for *ta enkainia* (the Feast of Dedication/Renewal). It is *cheimōn* (winter). The physical season mirrors the spiritual climate: cold, barren, and hostile. Jerusalem (*hieroso*) stands in the chill of unbelief, even as the Light of the World walks within her courts.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
και περιεπατει ο εν τω ϊερω εν τη ϲτοα ϲολομωνοϲ ϲολομωντοϲ

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] was walking in the temple in the porch of Solom[on].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The subject "Jesus" is absent or indicated only by the article *o*, emphasizing his presence. He walks in Solomon's porch—the place of wisdom and judgment. The scribe corrects the spelling of Solomon (*solomōnos* to *solomōntos*), ensuring the King of Peace is rightly located in the colonnade of his ancestor. He offers wisdom to a people who offer him stones.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
εκυκλωϲαν ουν αυτον οι ϊουδαιοι και ελε αυτω ˙ εωϲ πο την ψυχην η ερειϲ · ει ϲυ ει ο · ειπον ειπε ειπον ημ παρρηϲια ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews encircled him and were sa[ying] to him: Until wh[en] do you [lift/hold] [our] soul? If you are the [Christ], t[ell] us openly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
They *ekyklōsan* (encircled) him—a predatory term, like hounds baiting a lion. Their question is ironic: "Until when do you lift/take (*aireis*) our soul?"—meaning, "How long do you keep us in suspense?" The scribe's multiple attempts at the imperative "Tell us!" (*eipon eipe eipon*) capture their agitation. They demand *parrhēsia* (plain speech), yet they lack the ears to hear what has already been spoken in thunderous deeds.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
απεκρι αυτοιϲ ο ειπον ϋμ ϋμ και ου πιϲτευεται · τα εργα α εγω ποι εν ονοματι του πατροϲ μου ταυ μαρτυρι περι ε ·

**English Translation**
He answered them: I told you [you], and ye believe not; the works which I do in the name of the Father of me, these bear witness concerning me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal repetition of "you" (*hymin hymin*), which, though likely a slip of the pen, spiritually emphasizes the obstinacy of the audience. The Lord establishes the twin pillars of His authority: His word ("I told you") and His deed ("the works"). The heretics who separate the Christ of history from the Eternal Word are confounded here; the works are done specifically *in the name of the Father* (ΠΡϹ), sealing the unity of operation between the Begetter and the Begotten. The works are not merely marvels; they are *martyria*—testimonies.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
αλλα ϋμιϲ ου πιϲτευετε · οτι ου εϲται εκ των προ των εμ ·

**English Translation**
But ye believe not; because ye are not of the sheep [that are] mine.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the terrifying mystery of election. He does not say, "You are not my sheep because you do not believe," but rather, "You do not believe because you are not my sheep." The ontological state precedes the act of faith. The Codex here is stark, omitting the phrase "as I said unto you" found in other copies, thereby making the declaration absolute and immediate. To be outside the fold (*tōn probatōn*) is to be deaf to the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
τα προβατα τα εμα τηϲ φωνηϲ μου ακουουϲιν · και γι αυτα και ακολουθουϲιν μοι ·

**English Translation**
The sheep [that are] mine hear my voice; and [I know] them and they follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The abbreviation *gi* stands for *ginōskō* (I know). This is not intellectual cognition but relational intimacy. The sequence is inviolable: Possession ("mine") leads to Perception ("hear"), which is met by Divine Recognition ("I know"), resulting in Obedience ("follow"). The sheep do not wander aimlessly; they are tethered by the Voice. If one claims to belong to the Shepherd but does not walk in His footsteps, the claim is void.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
καγω διδω αυτοιϲ ζωην αιωνιον · και ου μη αποληται απολωνται ειϲ τον αιωνα · και ου μη αρπαϲη τιϲ αυ εκ τηϲ χειροϲ μου ·

**English Translation**
And I give to them life eternal; and they shall never perish [perish] into the age; and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the correction in the manuscript: the scribe first wrote *apolētai* (singular) then corrected to *apolōntai* (plural). Even the ink bears witness that salvation is both individual and corporate. The double negative *ou mē* provides the strongest possible assurance of safety "into the age" (eternity). The "hand" of the Son is the agent of power; to be in His hand is to be held by Omnipotence. No wolf, no heretic, no demon can pry open the fingers of the Logos.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ο πατηρ μου · ο δεδω μοι · παντ μειζων εϲτιν · και ουδιϲ δυναται αρπαζειν εκ τηϲ χειροϲ του πατροϲ ·

**English Translation**
The Father of me, who has given [them] to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch out of the hand of the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see the hierarchy of order, not of nature. The Father (ΠΗΡ) is the *fons divinitatis*, the source who gives the sheep to the Son. The text reads *pant[ōn] meizōn estin*—He is greater than all things. The security of the believer is doubly bolted: held in the hand of the Son (v. 28) and the hand of the Father (v. 29). Since the hands perform the same operation of protection, the Power is one.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
εγω και ο πατηρ εν εϲμεν ·

**English Translation**
I and the Father are one.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hammer of Arius and the stumbling block of Sabellius. *Ego kai ho Patēr* (two subjects) *hen esmen* (plural verb, neuter predicate). He does not say *heis* (one person), which would confound the hypostases, but *hen* (one thing/essence). They are distinct in personhood yet identical in substance. This short verse is the fortress of the Orthodox faith, declaring the *homoousion* before the Council of Nicaea ever met.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
εβαϲτα παλιν λιθουϲ οι ϊουδαιοι ϊνα λιθαϲωϲιν αυτ ·

**English Translation**
The Jews bore stones again that they might stone him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word *ebasta[san]* implies a heavy bearing, a deliberate lifting of executioner's tools. The carnal mind cannot comprehend spiritual unity; it responds to the revelation of Divinity with the violence of the earth. They recognize the claim of verse 30 perfectly—they know He claims equality with God—and proceed to judge the Judge of the world.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτοιϲ ο · πολλα εργα καλα εδιξα ϋμιν εκ του πατροϲ μου δι ποιον αυτων εργον εμε λιθα ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] answered them: Many good works I showed you from the Father of me; because of which work of them do ye stone me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord (Ο) appeals to the visible evidence. He characterizes His miracles as *kala*—good, beautiful, noble. They are not merely displays of power but manifestations of the Father's goodness. He forces them to confront the absurdity of their violence: they are stoning the Benefactor. The interrogation exposes that their hostility is not against a crime, but against the Light itself.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτω οι ϊου · περι καλου εργου ου λιθαζο ϲε · αλλα πε βλαϲφημιαϲ · ο ϲυ ανθρωποϲ ων · ποιειϲ ϲεαυ

**English Translation**
The Jews answered him: Concerning a good work we stone thee not, but concerning blasphemy; because thou, being a man, makest thyself...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text abruptly halts at *seau[ton]* (thyself), leaving the accusation hanging in the air, though the implication is "God." The charge is precise: *blasphemia*. They see only the flesh (*anthrōpos*) and miss the indwelling Glory. It is the tragic irony of the Incarnation: because He became truly man, they cannot believe He is truly God. They accuse Him of "making" Himself God, whereas He *is* God who "made" Himself man.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτοιϲ ο · ουκ εϲτιν γε εν τω νομω ϋμων οτι ει εγω ειπα θεοι εϲτε ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] answered them: Is it not written in your law that I said, Ye are gods?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord cites Psalm 81 (82). The abbreviation *ge* stands for *gegrammenon* (written), affirming the binding nature of Scripture. He uses the rabbinic argument *a fortiori*: If the Scripture can apply the title *theoi* (gods) to unjust judges merely because they received the word of God, how is the title blasphemous for the One who is the Word by nature? The "I said" (*ego eipa*) in the Psalm is the voice of the pre-incarnate Christ speaking through the prophet.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ει ε ειπεν θεουϲ · προϲ ουϲ ο λογοϲ του εγε · και ου δυνα λυθηναι η γρα ·

**English Translation**
If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A high doctrine of inspiration: *ou dynatai lythēnai*—the Scripture cannot be loosened, untied, or annulled. If God gives a title, it stands. The distinction is drawn between those to whom the Word *came* (external reception, adoption) and the One who *is* the Son (internal nature). We are gods by grace; He is God by nature.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ον ο πατηρʼ η και απε ειϲ τον κο · ϋμειϲ λεγε οτι βλαϲφημιϲ · οτι ειπον ϋϊοϲ ειμι ·

**English Translation**
[Him] whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, do ye say that, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am Son?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Sinaiticus text is terse here, ending simply with *huios eimi* ("I am Son"), omitting "of God." This brevity is powerful. The argument rests on His mission: He was "sanctified" (set apart) and "sent" by the Father. This is the Christological seal. If the lesser "gods" of the Psalm were sanctified by a mere word, how much more holy is the One sanctified by the Father's very essence and sent into the cosmos (*kosmon*)? To deny His Sonship is to deny the Father's act of sending.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
ει ου ποιω τα εργα του πατροϲ μου · μη πιϲτευε μοι ·

**English Translation**
If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Lord submits His divine authority to the test of tangible righteousness. He does not demand a blind adherence devoid of evidence, but anchors His claim in the *erga* (works). If His deeds do not mirror the nature of the Father (*patros*), He absolves the listener of the duty to believe. This is the fearlessness of Truth; it invites scrutiny, knowing that the Son's activity is nothing less than the Father's will made visible in the flesh.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ει δε ποιω · καν εμοι μη πιϲτευ · τοιϲ εργοιϲ πι · ϊνα γνω και πιϲτευητε οτι εν εμοι ο πα καγω εν τω πατρι

**English Translation**
But if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the Father [is] in me and I in the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the great concession to human frailty: "even if ye believe not me." The Physician offers a second path to healing for those blinded by the brightness of His person—the path of the works. He commands faith in the deeds (*tois ergois pi*) as a stepping stone to the higher mystery. The destination of this faith is twofold: to know (*gno*) and to believe (*pisteuete*) the perichoresis—the mutual indwelling where the Father (*pa*) is in the Son, and the Son in the Father. The works are the visible seal of this indivisible unity.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
εζητουν ο ο αυτον παλιν πιαϲαι και εξηλθεν εκ τηϲ χει αυτων ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they sought again to seize him; and he went forth out of their hand.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The revelation of His unity with the Father provokes the wrath of the carnal mind. They seek to *piasai* (seize) Him, attempting to bind the Word with physical force. Yet, note the sovereignty of the Lord: He "went forth out of their hand" (*ek tes chei auton*). He does not flee in terror, but passes through their midst. Until His hour is come, no human hand has power to restrain the Lord of Glory; He remains free even when surrounded.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και α παλιν πε του ϊορδανου ειϲ τ τοπον οπου ην ϊωαν το προτερον βαπτιζων · και ε εκει ·

**English Translation**
And [he went] away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was formerly baptizing; and [he abode] there.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He withdraws from the hardened hearts of Jerusalem to the wilderness, crossing beyond the Jordan (*pe tou iordanou*). He returns to the foundational site where John (*Ioan*) first bore witness. By abiding (*e*) there, Christ validates the testimony of the Forerunner. He retreats from the temple made of stones to the sanctuary of the desert, where the voice of prophecy first prepared His way, showing that the true Israel is found where the Word is received, not merely where the altar stands.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
και πολλοι ηλθον προϲ αυτον και ε · μεν ϲημιον ε ουδεν · παντα δε οϲα ει ϊωαννηϲ περι τουτου αλη ην ·

**English Translation**
And many came to him and said: Indeed [he] did no sign; but all things as many as John said concerning this one were true.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowds discern the difference between the Herald and the King. They acknowledge that John performed no miracle (*semion*), yet his words were *alethes* (true). This is a profound vindication: the lack of signs in John's ministry highlights the abundance of truth in his prophecy. They see the fulfillment of John's words in Christ's deeds. The servant spoke, but the Master acts; the prophecy was the lamp, but here is the Light itself, confirming the witness of the friend of the Bridegroom.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
και πολλοι επιϲτευϲαν ειϲ αυ εκει :

**English Translation**
And many believed in him there.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A succinct triumph concludes the chapter. While the rulers in Jerusalem took up stones, the humble in the wilderness offer faith. *Polloi* (many) believed in Him, not in the holy city, but *ekei* (there)—in the place of exile. Faith flourishes where the heart is open, often far from the seats of power. The sheep know the Shepherd's voice, and even beyond the Jordan, the gathering of the flock continues against the wolves who seek to scatter it.
