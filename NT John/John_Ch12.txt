**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ο ουν προ εξʼ η του παϲχα ˙ ηλθεν ειϲ βηθα · οπου ην λα ον ηγειρεν ο εκ νεκρων ·

**English Translation**
He therefore, before six days of the Passover, came into Bethany; where was La[zarus], whom Je[sus] raised from the dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the precision of the time: "before six days of the Passover." The Lamb of God approaches the altar of the Cross at the very season appointed for the sacrifice. He returns to Bethany, the house of obedience, to the place where He displayed His power over death. The text abbreviates the name of Lazarus (`λα`) and the Lord (`ο`), yet the reality is full: the Resurrector stands beside the resurrected one. He comes not to flee death, but to confront it, having already proven His victory by raising him who was four days dead.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ε ουν αυ δειπνον εκει · και η μαρθα διη · ο δε λαζαροϲ ειϲ ην · εκ των α ϲυ ϲ αυτω :

**English Translation**
They made therefore for him a supper there; and Martha served; but Lazarus was one [of those] reclining with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is a table spread in the presence of enemies, a type of the Eucharistic feast. Martha fulfills her ministry (`διη` - *diakonia*) in active service, a model for the priesthood of action. But look upon Lazarus! He who was bound in grave clothes now reclines (`α ϲυ ϲ`) at the table with his Creator. This proves the resurrection was no phantasm; the dead man eats and drinks. It is a communion of the Master with the fruit of His mercy.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
η ουν μαρια λαβου λιτραν μυρου · ναρδου πιϲτικηϲ πολυτιμου · ηλι τουϲ ποδαϲ του · και εξεμαξεν ταιϲ θριξιν αυτηϲ · τουϲ ποδαϲ αυτου · η δε οικια επλη εκ τηϲ οϲ του μυρου ·

**English Translation**
Therefore Mary, having taken a litra of myrrh, of nard faithful [and] very precious, anointed the feet of Je[sus]; and wiped with her hairs his feet; and the house was filled from the odor of the myrrh.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mary offers the "pistic" (`πιϲτικηϲ`) nard—that is, genuine, unadulterated faith. She anoints not the head, but the feet, showing extreme humility, drying them with her glory (for a woman's hair is her glory). The house is filled (`επλη`) with the scent (`οϲ`), just as the Church is filled with the fragrance of Christ's knowledge. She offers the best of creation to the Creator, recognizing Him as the High Priest preparing for His own sacrifice.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
λε δε ϊουδαϲ ο ϊϲκα · ειϲ εκ τ μαθητων αυτου · ο μελλων αυτον παραδιδοναι ·

**English Translation**
But says Judas the Isca[riot], one of his disciples, the [one] about to betray him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist marks the traitor clearly. While the house is filled with sweet fragrance, the heart of Judas is filled with bitterness. He is called "one of the disciples," a terrifying warning that proximity to the Holy One does not guarantee holiness. He is "about to betray," for the seed of treachery was already germinating within the garden of the apostolic band.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
δια τουτο το μυρον ουκ επραθη τρια δηναρι · και εδοθη πτω ·

**English Translation**
"Why was this myrrh not sold for three [hundred] denarii and given to the poor?"

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the mask of avarice wearing the face of charity. Judas values the myrrh at three hundred (`τρια`) denarii, calculating the price of the offering rather than the worth of the Recipient. He speaks of the "poor" (`πτω`), yet he is the poorest of all, destitute of grace. The wicked often use the commandment of almsgiving to stifle the worship of God, setting one virtue against another to destroy both.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε του · ουχ οτι περι τ πτωχων εμελ αυτω · αλλ οτι κλε ην · και το γλωϲϲοκομον ε τα βαλλομε εβαϲταζεν ˙

**English Translation**
But he said this, not because about the poor it mattered to him, but because he was a thief, and having the money-box, the things put in he used to carry [off].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Spirit searches the deep things of man. Judas was a thief (`κλε` - *kleptes*). He carried the *glossokomon* (the box), but he did not carry the trust. The text says he "carried" (`εβαϲταζεν`) what was put in, implying he carried it away for himself. Sacrilege begins with small thefts from the sanctuary and ends with the selling of the Lord of Glory. He who loves silver more than the Savior will eventually trade the Savior for silver.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν ο · αφεϲ αυτην · ϊνα ειϲ τ ημεραν του εν μου τηρηϲη αυτο ·

**English Translation**
Therefore said Je[sus]: "Leave her; that for the day of my burial she might keep it."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord protects the worshiper. "Leave her" (`αφεϲ αυτην`), He commands, halting the judgment of the traitor. He reveals the mystery: this anointing is prophetic. It is for the day of His `εν` (*entaphiasmou* - preparation for burial). Mary, by the Spirit, performs the funeral rites for the Life of the World before He tastes death. Christ accepts the honor of the dead while yet living, signifying He is the Lord over the tomb.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
τουϲ πτωχουϲ γαρ π εχετε μεθ ε · εμε δε ου παντοτε εχετε :

**English Translation**
"For the poor always you have with yourselves; but me you do not always have."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Do not misunderstand, brethren. He does not despise the poor, for He became poor for our sake. But He distinguishes between the *diakonia* of the poor and the *latria* (worship) of God Incarnate. There is a time for alms, and a time for adoration. His bodily presence (`εμε`) was a fleeing moment in history; the opportunity to honor His physical form was passing. We must discern the *kairos*, the appointed time, for each duty.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
εγνω ουν ο οχλοϲ πολυϲ εκ των ϊου οτι εκει ε · και ηλθον ου δια τον μον μον · αλλ ϊνα και τον λαζαρον ϊδωϲιν · ον ηγειρεν εκ νε ·

**English Translation**
Therefore a great crowd of the Jews knew that he is there; and they came not because of Je[sus] only, but that also Lazarus they might see, whom he raised from the dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd is drawn by the spectacle. They come not for the doctrine, but for the sign. The text repeats `μον` (only) twice—perhaps a scribal emphasis or slip, yet true: they came not for Jesus "only, only," but for the curiosity of the miracle. Lazarus is the living trophy of Christ's victory (`νικος`) over the grave (`νε` - *nekron*). The sheep gather, but mixed with wolves, seeking the sensational rather than the salvific.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
εβουλευϲ δε οι αρχϊερειϲ · ϊνα και τον λαζα αποκτινωϲ αποκτινωϲ ·

**English Translation**
But the chief priests planned that also Lazarus they might kill [kill].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Oh, the madness of the high priests! They plan to kill (`αποκτινωϲ`) him whom Christ raised. The repetition in the Codex (`αποκτινωϲ αποκτινωϲ`) echoes the intensity of their murderous rage. They fight against God; they think that by killing the witness, they can annul the miracle. But how can they kill one who has already conquered death through Christ? Their malice blinds them to the futility of warring against the Resurrection.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
οτι πολλοι δι αυ ϋπηγον τ τ ϊουδαιων · και ε ειϲ τ τ

**English Translation**
Because many on account of him were going away [of] the Jews, and believing in the [Je(sus)].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Lazarus, without speaking, is a preacher. "On account of him" (`δι αυ`), the people withdrew from the synagogue of the unbelieving Jews and approached the Light. The text is fragmented at the end (`ειϲ τ τ`), pointing toward "the Jesus." Faith (`ε` - *episteuon*) is the movement from the old covenant to the new, provoked by the evidence of life. The living stone (Lazarus) draws men to the Cornerstone.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
τη επαυριον οχλοϲ πολυϲ ο ελθων ειϲ την εορτην · ακου οτι ερχε ειϲ ϊεροϲολυ ˙

**English Translation**
On the morrow a great crowd, the [one] having come to the feast, having heard that Je[sus] comes to Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"On the morrow"—the day following the Sabbath and the supper. The crowd gathers for the legal feast (`εορτην`), but the True Feast is approaching them. They hear (`ακου`) the rumor of the King. He comes to Jerusalem (`ϊεροϲολυ`), the city that kills the prophets, to offer Himself as the final Pascha. The multitude prepares to receive Him with palms, unknowingly preparing the path for the King of Glory to ascend His wooden throne.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**

ελαβον τα βα των φοινικ · και εξηλθον ειϲ ϋ αυτω · και εκραυγαζον · λεγοντεϲ · ωϲαν · ευλογημενοϲ ο ερχομενοϲ εν ο · και και ο βαϲιλευϲ του ι :


**English Translation**

They took the bra[nches] of the palms; and went out to a m[eeting] with him; and were crying out; saying; Hosan[na]; blessed [is] the [one] coming in [the] n[ame]; and and the King of I[srael].


**Episcopal Exegesis**

Observe here the prophetic recognition by the multitude. They seize the *baia* (palm branches), emblems of victory and immortality, anticipating the triumph over death which the Lord approaches. The cry "Hosanna" (Save now) is joined to the messianic title. The text exhibits a stammering of joy, "and and," emphasizing the addition that scandalized the rulers: He is not merely a pilgrim, but the "King of Israel." The abbreviation `εν ο` signifies that He comes not in His own power, but in the Name of the Father, preserving the unity of the Godhead even in this earthly procession.


**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**

ευρων δε ο ονα εκαθιϲεν ε αυτο καθωϲ εϲ γεγραμμενον ·


**English Translation**

Finding then the [Jesus] a young donkey he sat u[pon] it just as i[s] written;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The Lord does not seek a chariot of war, nor a steed of pride, but finding a simple *onarion* (young donkey), He seats Himself. This act is a deliberate fulfillment of the ancient scroll, demonstrating that His Kingdom rests upon humility and peace. He sits (`εκαθιϲεν`) with authority, transforming the beast of burden into the throne of the Logos, showing that the lowly things of creation are elevated when they bear the Word of God.


**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**

μη φοβου θυγατερ ϲιων · ϊδου ο βαϲι ϲου ερχεται · καθημενοϲ επι πωλον ονου ·


**English Translation**

Do not fear daughter of Sion; behold the Ki[ng] of you comes; sitting upon a foal of a donkey;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The command "Do not fear" addresses the daughter of Sion, the faithful remnant of the Church. Fear belongs to the bondservant; confidence belongs to the daughter. The King (`βαϲι`) arrives not to judge the city yet, but to save it. The specificity of the "foal" indicates a newness; no man had sat upon it, just as no man had lain in the tomb He would soon occupy. It is a mystery of purity and new creation.


**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**

ταυ ουκ εγνωϲαν αυτου οι μαθηται το πρωτον · αλλ ο εδοξαϲθη · το εμνηϲθηϲαν ο ταυτα επ αυτω γεγραμμενα ˙ και ταυτα εποιηϲαν αυ ·


**English Translation**

Th[ese things] his disciples did not know at the first; but [when] he was glorified; th[en] they remembered th[at] these things upon him [were] written; and these things they did to him;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

Here is the economy of revelation: understanding follows glorification. The disciples performed the actions of the liturgy—the procession, the palms—without comprehending the theology. Only after the Cross and Resurrection (the glorification) did the Spirit illuminate the Scriptures (`γεγραμμενα`). We learn that we often serve God in mystery, our actions containing truths that our minds only later grasp through the light of the Spirit.


**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**

εμαρτυρι ουν ο οχλοϲ · ο ων με αυτου οτε τον λαζαρον εφωνη εκ του μνη και ηγειρεν αυτον εκ νεκρων ·


**English Translation**

Therefore the crowd was testifying; the [one] being w[ith] him when Lazarus he called out of the tom[b] and raised him out of [the] dead;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The crowd acts as a witness (`εμαρτυρι`), bridging the miracle of Bethany with the entry to Jerusalem. The power of the Lord is located in His voice: He "called" (`εφωνη`). This same voice that summoned light at creation now summons life from the `μνη` (tomb). The resurrection of Lazarus is the catalyst for the adoration of the multitude, a foretaste of the general resurrection where all shall hear His voice.


**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**

δια τουτο και ϋπ ϋπ αυτω ο πολυϲ · οτι ηκουϲαν αυτον τουτο πεποιηκε το ϲημειον ·


**English Translation**

On account of this also met met him the many; because they heard him to have done this sign;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The text stammers with urgency (`ϋπ ϋπ`, likely a scribal doubling of *hypēntēsen*, "met"), reflecting the rushing of the "many" (`ο πολυϲ`). Faith comes by hearing, for they "heard" of the sign. The miracle (`ϲημειον`) is not an end in itself but a signpost pointing to the nature of the Person: the Conqueror of Hades. They run to meet Life itself.


**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**

οι ουν φαριϲαιοι ειπαν προϲ εαυ · θεωρειτε ο ουκ ωφελειτε ουδεν · ειδε ο κο οπιϲω αυτου απηλθεν :


**English Translation**

The Pharisees therefore said to thems[elves]; You observe th[at] you profit nothing; look the wo[rld] behind him went away.


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The adversaries of the Truth confess their bankruptcy. "You profit nothing" is the eternal verdict on malice against God. Their hyperbole, "the world (`ο κο`) went away behind him," is an unconscious prophecy. Indeed, not just Judea, but the entire *kosmos*—Jew and Greek—is destined to follow the Incarnate Word. Their despair is the Church's hope.


**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**

ηϲαν δε ελληνεϲ τινεϲ εκ των α · ϊνα προϲκυνη εν τη εορ ·


**English Translation**

Now there were certain Greeks out of the [ones] g[oing up]; in order that they might worship in the feas[t];


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The prophecy of the Pharisees is immediately realized: Greeks (`ελληνεϲ`) appear. These are the firstfruits of the Gentiles, drawn by the Father to the Son. They come "to worship" (`προϲκυνη`), showing that the true instinct of the soul, even among the nations, is to adore the Creator. They ascend to the feast, but they will find the true Paschal Lamb.


**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**

ουτοι ουν προϲ φιλιππω τω απο βηθϲαϊ τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ · και ηρωτων αυτ λεγοντεϲ · θε τον ϊδιν ·


**English Translation**

These therefore [came] to Philip the [one] from Bethsai[da] of Galilee; and were asking hi[m] saying; [We] wi[sh] the [Jesus] to see;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

They approach Philip, perhaps because of his Greek name or origin. Their request is the cry of all humanity: "We wish to see." The text is abbreviated (`θε τον ϊδιν`), condensing the desire: *Thelomen* (we wish) *idein* (to see). They do not ask for wisdom or signs, but for the Beatific Vision—to see the Person of Jesus. This is the ultimate end of all contemplation.


**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**

ερχεται φιλιπποϲ και λεγει τω αν ανδρεα · και παλιν ερχεται ανδρεαϲ και φιλιπποϲ κ(αι) λεγουϲιν τω ·


**English Translation**

Comes Philip and says to An[drew]; and again comes Andrew and Philip a(nd) they say to the [Jesus];


**Episcopal Exegesis**

Observe the hierarchy and order even among the Apostles. Philip seeks counsel from Andrew, the first-called. Together, as a twofold witness, they approach the Lord. It reveals the gravity of the moment: the wall of partition is breaking, and the Gentiles are seeking the Messiah. They do not presume to open the door without the Master's hand.


**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**

ο δε αποκρινε αυτοιϲ λεγων · εληλυθεν η ωρα · ϊνα δοξαϲθη ο ϋϊ του ανθρωπου ·


**English Translation**

But the [Jesus] answers them saying; Has come the hour; that might be glorified the So[n] of Man;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The arrival of the Greeks signals the *Hora* (Hour). Throughout the Gospel, the Hour was "not yet"; now, with the nations gathering, the clock of salvation strikes. But the glory (`δοξαϲθη`) is not a crown of gold, but the Cross. The Son of Man is glorified in His extreme humiliation, for there He draws all men—Jews and Greeks—unto Himself.


**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**

αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν · εαν μη ο κοκ του ϲιτου πε ειϲ την γην αποθανη · αυτοϲ μονοϲ μενει · εαν δε αποθανη πο καρπον φερει ·


**English Translation**

Amen amen I say to you; if not the grai[n] of wheat fal[ling] into the earth dies; it alone remains; but if it dies mu[ch] fruit it bears;


**Episcopal Exegesis**

The Lord unveils the mystery of life through death using the creation itself. He is the Divine Grain (`κοκ`) of wheat. Unless He descends into the earth (the tomb/Hades) and dies, He remains the Only Begotten, alone in His divinity. But through death (`αποθανη`), He becomes the Firstborn of many brethren, bearing "much fruit"—the harvest of the Church gathered from the Greeks and the Jews. The fertility of the Church flows from the mortality of the Christ.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ο φιλων την ψυ αυτου · απολ αυτην · και ο μειϲων την ψυ αυτου εν τω κοϲμω τουτω ειϲ ζωην αιωνιον φυλαξει αυτ ·

**English Translation**
The [one] loving the soul of him, loses it; and the [one] hating the soul of him in the world this, into life eternal shall guard it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the economy of salvation written in the very contractions of the sacred page. The scribe writes $\psi\upsilon$ (*psychen*), compressing the 'soul' into a breath, just as we must be willing to compress and diminish our earthly life. He who loves this breath loses it (`απολ`), but he who hates it in this present order guards it (`φυλαξει`) unto the age to come. The text does not say he "saves" it, but "guards" (`φυλαξει`) it, as a deposit entrusted to the treasury of God.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
εαν εμοι τιϲ διακο · εμοι ακολου και οπου ει εγω εκει και ο διακονοϲ ο εμοϲ εϲται · εαν τιϲ εμοι διακονη ϲειμη τειμηϲει τειμηϲει αυτον ο πατηρ ·

**English Translation**
If to me anyone serves, to me let him follow; and where am I, there also the servant the [one] mine shall be; if anyone to me serves, [honor] will honor will honor him the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hand of the copyist stumbles under the weight of the promise, producing a divine stammer: `ϲειμη τειμηϲει τειμηϲει` (*[honor] will honor, will honor*). It is as if the single promise of the Father’s honor is insufficient to express the magnitude of the reward. The servant (`διακονοϲ`) follows the Master into suffering, and the Father heaps honor upon honor upon him. We do not correct this repetition; we embrace it as the superabundance of grace.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
νυν η ψυχη μου τεταρακται · και τι ειπω · πατερʼ ϲωϲ ϲωϲ με εκ τηϲ ωραϲ ταυ · αλλα δια τουτο ηλθον ειϲ την ωραν ταυτην ·

**English Translation**
Now the soul of me has been troubled; and what might I say? Father, save save me from the hour this? But because of this I came unto the hour this.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we see the true humanity of the Word. His soul is troubled. The text reads `ϲωϲ ϲωϲ` (*sos sos*—save, save), a double cry of distress. Is this a scribal error, or the twofold plea of the flesh shrinking from the Cross? Yet, the resolution is immediate. He does not ask to be saved *from* the hour in the final estimation, for `δια τουτο` (because of this) He arrived. He enters the hour voluntarily, though the flesh cries out twice.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
πα δοξαϲον ϲου το ονομα · ηλθεν ουν φωνη εκ του ουρανου · και εδο και παλιν δο ·

**English Translation**
Fa[ther], glorify of you the name. Came therefore a voice out of the heaven: Both I glorified [it], and again I [will] glo[rify it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred names and actions are abbreviated, hastening the divine drama. `πα` for Father; `εδο` and `δο` for the acts of glorification. The Father's response from heaven is swift and thunderous. He has glorified the name in the Incarnation and miracles (`εδο`), and He will glorify it again (`παλιν δο`) in the Cross and Resurrection. The text rushes, for the action of God is swift.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ο ουν οχλοϲ ο εϲτωϲ ακουϲαϲ · ελεγεν βροντην γεγονεναι · αλλοι ελεγον · αγγελοϲ αυτω λελαληκεν ˙

**English Translation**
The therefore crowd the [one] standing [and] having heard, was saying thunder to have happened; others were saying: An angel to him has spoken.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The natural man perceives only natural phenomena; the crowd hears `βροντην` (thunder). Those with a slightly higher, yet still imperfect perception, speak of an `αγγελοϲ` (angel). They cannot grasp the direct communion between the Father and the Son. They stand (`εϲτωϲ`) but they do not understand.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη · ου δι εμε η φωνη αυ γεγονεν · αλλα δι ϋμαϲ ·

**English Translation**
He answered: Not because of me the voice this has happened, but because of you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord clarifies the purpose of the revelation. The voice `αυ` (this one) was not for the strengthening of the Son, who knows the Father always, but `δι ϋμαϲ` (for your sake). The diaeresis over the upsilon in `ϋμαϲ` emphasizes the separation: the voice is a bridge thrown across the chasm for *you*, the unbelieving or weak-faithed listeners.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
νυν κριϲιϲ εϲτιν του κοϲμου νυν ο αρχων τουτου τουτου και νυν ο αρχων του κοϲ τουτου εκβλη εξω ·

**English Translation**
Now judgment is of the world; now the ruler of this, of this [world?]; and now the ruler of the world this shall be cast out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Confusion reigns in the text, mirroring the confusion of the defeated adversary. The scribe writes `τουτου τουτου` (of this, of this) and repeats the phrase regarding the ruler (`αρχων`). It reads as a stuttering proclamation of the devil's defeat. "The ruler of this... of this... and now the ruler of this world is cast out!" The repetition serves to emphasize the certainty of the expulsion (`εκβλη εξω`). The usurper is stammered out of his domain.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
καγω εαν ϋψωθω εκ τηϲ γηϲ · παντα πανταϲ ελ προϲ εμαυτ εμαυτ ·

**English Translation**
And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, all things [all men] I will draw to myself myself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound textual variant confronts us. The scribe writes `παντα` (all things) then corrects or expands to `πανταϲ` (all men). Which is it? It is both. By the Cross, He draws the entire cosmos (`παντα`) and all humanity (`πανταϲ`) to Himself. And note the emphatic ending: `εμαυτ εμαυτ` (myself, myself). The drawing is exclusively, intensely to His own person. There is no other gathering point for the universe but the body of the lifted-up Christ.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
τουτον τουτο τουτο δε ελεγεν ϲημαινων · ποιω θανατω εμελλεν αποθνηϲκειν ·

**English Translation**
This [man], this, this moreover he was saying, signifying by what sort of death he was about to die.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the scribe stammers: `τουτον τουτο τουτο` (This one, this, this). It is as if the finger points repeatedly at the manner of death. The Cross is the "This" which defines history. He `εμελλεν` (was about) to die; the destiny was fixed. The repetition arrests the eye, forcing us to contemplate the specific mode (`ποιω`) of His passion—the lifting up.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ουν αυ ο οχλοϲ · ημιϲ η εκ του νομου · οτι ο με ειϲ τον αιωνα ˙ και πωϲ ϲυ λεγιϲ ˙ οτι δει ϋψωθηναι τον του ανθρω · τιϲ εϲτιν ου ο του ανθρω ·

**English Translation**
Answered therefore him the crowd: We heard out of the law that the [?] remains into the age; and how [do] you say that it is necessary to be lifted up the [?] of the man? Who is this the [?] of the man?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful omission! The Codex reads `οτι ο με` (that the... remains). The word *Christos* is absent! And again, `τον του ανθρω` (the... of the man). The word *Son* ($\upsilon\iota\varsigma$) is missing! The crowd asks, "Who is this... of the man?" The text itself has stripped the titles away, perhaps reflecting the spiritual blindness of the crowd who cannot see the *Christ* or the *Son*, but only the man. They know the Law says "He remains," but they have lost the subject of the sentence.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν αυτοιϲ ο · ετι μι χρονον το φωϲ εν ϋμιν εϲτ εϲτ · περιπατειτε εωϲ το φωϲ εχετε ϊνα μη η ϲκοτια ϋμαϲ κα · και ο περι εν τη ϲκο · ουκ οιδεν που ϋπαγει ·

**English Translation**
Said therefore to them the [Jesus]: Yet a little time the light among you is is. Walk while the light you have, so that not the darkness you might [overtake]; and the [one] walking in the darkness does not know where he goes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord is nameless here (`ο`—the [One]), and the text is urgent. `εϲτ εϲτ` (is, is)—the Light *is* here, emphatically present! But the time is `μι` (little/small). The warning `ϊνα μη... κα` (lest... overtake) uses an abbreviated verb for "overtake" (*katalabē*), as if the darkness is snapping at the heels of the sentence. He who walks in darkness (`ϲκο`) has lost his direction entirely.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ το φωϲ εχετε πιϲτευεται ειϲ το φωϲ ϊνα ϋϊ φωτοϲ γενηϲθε · ταυτα ελαληϲεν ο και απελθων ε απ αυτων ·

**English Translation**
While the light you have, believe into the light, so that sons of light you might become. These things spoke the [Jesus], and having departed was [hidden] from them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command `πιϲτευεται` is spelled as an indicative, yet functions as an imperative: "You believe" or "Believe!" The goal is to become `ϋϊ φωτοϲ` (sons of light). But observe the ending: `απελθων ε απ αυτων`. The verb *ekrubē* (was hidden) is slashed to a mere `ε`. He spoke, and then—*gone*. The Light withdrew. The brevity of the text marks the suddenness of the eclipse. The sun has set upon the Jews.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
τοϲαυτα δε αυτου ϲη πεποιηκοτοϲ εμπροϲθεν αυτ · ουκ επιϲτευον ειϲ αυτον ·

**English Translation**
But though he had done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Herein lies the great paradox of the hardness of heart. The Evangelist records that the signs (*semeia*) were not few, nor done in a corner, but "so many" and "before them." The Greek *semia* (contracted here as ϲη) indicates these were not merely wonders, but markers of divine authority. Yet, the will of man retains the terrifying power to negate the evidence of the eyes. Faith is not a mechanical result of seeing miracles; it requires an internal disposition to receive the Truth.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα ο λο ηϲαϊου του προ πληρωθη ον ειπεν · · τιϲ ε τη ακο ημων · και ο βρα τινι απε ·

**English Translation**
That the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled which he said: Who believed our report? And the arm [of the Lord], to whom was it revealed?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scripture must needs be fulfilled, not because God compels men to disbelief, but because the Spirit foresaw their obstinacy. The scribe abbreviates "believed" (*episteusen*) to a mere epsilon (*ε*), and "revealed" (*apekaluphthe*) to *ape*, yet the weight of the prophecy remains. The "arm" (*brachion*) signifies the active power of God—the Son Himself in operation. It is revealed only to the humble, while the proud see the sign but discern not the Arm.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
δια του ουκ ηδυναντο πιϲτευειν · οτι πα ειπεν ηϲαϊαϲ ·

**English Translation**
On account of this they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the severity of the phrase "they were not able" (*ouk ēdunanto*). This inability is not a defect of nature created by God, but a defect of the will hardened by habit. When the soul repeatedly rejects the light, it eventually loses the organ of sight. The "again" (*palin*) links the previous complaint of the prophet to the specific judgment of blindness that follows.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
τετυφλωκεν αυτ τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ · και επηρωϲεν αυ την καρδιαν · ϊνα μη ειδωϲιν τοιϲ οφθαλμοιϲ · και τη καρδια ϲυνω · και ϲτραφωϲ και αυτουϲ ·

**English Translation**
He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they might not see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and turn, and [I heal] them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful judgment. God is said to blind them by withdrawing His grace from those who first withdrew their obedience. The text here is stark, abbreviating "understand" (*synōsin*) and "turn" (*straphōsin*). Note the ending *kai autous* ("and them")—the verb for "heal" is absent in the letter but implied in the sense. The Codex leaves us with the subjects suspended, emphasizing their unfinished state. They cannot turn; therefore, they remain unhealed.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπεν ηϲαϊ · οτι ειδεν την δο αυτου · και ελα περι αυτου ·

**English Translation**
These things Isaiah said, because he saw his glory, and spoke concerning him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A cornerstone of our theology. Isaiah saw the glory (*doxan*) of the Lord of Hosts (Yahweh) in the temple, yet the Evangelist declares he saw *His* glory—that is, the glory of Christ. Thus, the Son is identified with the Lord of the prophets. The pre-incarnate Word was the subject of the prophet's vision and the content of his speech (*elalēsen*).

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
ομωϲ μεντοι · και εκ των αρχοντ πολλοι επιϲτευϲαν ειϲ αυτον · αλλα δια τουϲ φαριϲαιουϲ · ου ωμολογουν · ϊνα μη αποϲυναγωγοι γενωνται ·

**English Translation**
Nevertheless, however, even of the rulers many believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [it], lest they become put out of the synagogue.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Faith without confession is a stillborn thing. "Many believed," yet they are not praised, for they feared expulsion (*aposynagōgoi*) more than they feared God. This is the "faith" of the coward. The Codex explicitly names the "rulers" (*archontōn*), showing that knowledge of the truth existed in high places, but was strangled by the political pressure of the Pharisees.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
ηγαπη γαρ την δοξαν των ανθρωπων μαλλον · ϋπερ την δοξαν του ·

**English Translation**
For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the root of the spiritual disease. It is a disorder of love (*ēgapēsan*). They placed the approval of mortals above the approval of the Divine. The scribe abbreviates "of God" to *tou*, relying on the reader to supply the Holy Name. To prefer the transient vapor of human praise over the eternal weight of God's glory is the very definition of folly.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
δε εκραξεν και ει · ο πιϲτευων ει εμε · ου πιϲτευει ειϲ εμε · αλλα ειϲ τ πεμψαντα με ·

**English Translation**
But [Jesus] cried out and said: He who believes in me, does not believe in me, but in him who sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord "cries out" (*ekraxen*), indicating a public, urgent proclamation. He dissolves the distinction between Himself and the Father in the act of faith. One cannot stop at the humanity of Christ; true faith passes through the Son (*eis eme*) to the Father (*ton pempsanta*). He is the Way, not a rival destination.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
και ο θεωρων εμε · θεω τον πεμψαντα με

**English Translation**
And he who beholds me, beholds him who sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the visual counterpart to the previous verse. "Beholding" (*theōrōn*) implies contemplation. To look upon the Son is to see the Father, for the Son is the express image of the Father's substance. There is no "Father" to be found apart from the revelation in the Son. The scribe abbreviates *theōrei* (beholds) to *theō*, hastening to the unity of the Sender and the Sent.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
εγω · φωϲ ειϲ τ κοϲμον εληλυθα · ϊνα παϲ ο πιϲτευ ειϲ εμε εν τη ϲκο μη μινη ·

**English Translation**
I have come as light into the world, that everyone believing in me might not remain in the darkness.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world's natural state is darkness (*skotia*). Christ does not emerge from the world but comes *into* it (*elēlytha*) from without. The purpose of the Incarnation is illumination. Note the scribe's spelling *minē* (remain) for *meinē*; the meaning stands: faith is the movement from static darkness into dynamic light.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
και ε τιϲ μου ακουϲη των ρηματων και μη φυλαξη · εγω ου κρινω αυτον · ου γαρ ηλθον ϊνα κρι τον κοϲμον · αλλ ινα ϲωϲω τ κοϲμον ·

**English Translation**
And if anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Sinaiticus text reads *phylaxē* (keep/guard) where others might read "believe." This emphasizes obedience. The First Advent is strictly for salvation (*sōsō*). The Lord suspends immediate judgment to allow space for repentance. He is the Savior now; the Judge later. To "keep" the words is to treasure them as the path to life.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
ο αθετ εμε · και μη λαμ τα ρηματα μου · εχει τον κρι αυτον · ο λο ον ελαληϲα ε κρινει αυ · εν τη εϲχατη ημερα ·

**English Translation**
He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has one who judges him: the word which I spoke, that will judge him in the last day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Though Christ came to save, His Word (*logos*) possesses an inherent judicial power. The rejecter (*athetōn*) is not judged by a new arbitrary decree, but by the very Truth he spurned. The Word stands as an objective standard. On the "last day" (*eschatē hēmera*), the sinner will find that the Gospel he refused is the very statute by which he is condemned.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
οτι εγω ε εμαυτου ουκ ελα · αλλ ο πεμ με πατηρʼ αυ μοι εντολην δεδωκεν · τι ειπω · και τι λαληϲω ·

**English Translation**
For I did not speak from myself; but the Father who sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the profound humility of the Only-Begotten in the flesh. He declares, "I did not speak from myself" (*ε εμαυτου ουκ ελα*), establishing that the Word of God is never severed from the Mind of God. The Son is the voice, the Father the source, yet they are one in essence. He uses two distinct verbs here: *eipō* (say) and *lalēsō* (speak). This is no idle repetition. The commandment given by the Father covers both the substance of the doctrine (*ti eipō*—what I should say) and the manner of its delivery (*ti lalēsō*—how I should speak it). The preacher must tremble, for if the Lord Himself waited upon the Father’s commandment before opening His mouth, how much more must we bind our tongues to the received Scripture? The authority of the Christ is absolute precisely because it is derivative; He is the perfect Icon of the Sender (*o pem me patēr*).

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
και οιδα οτι η εντολη αυτου · ζωη αιωνι εϲτιν · ἁ ουν ε λαλω · καθωϲ ει μοι ο πατηρ · ουτωϲ λαλω :

**English Translation**
And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Therefore, what things I speak, just as the Father has said to me, so I speak.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the summation of the Gospel economy: the commandment of the Father is not a burden of law, but *zōē aiōni*—Life Eternal. To hear the Son is to intake Life. We see the perfect obedience of the Son described in the phrase *kathōs ei moi o patēr* (just as the Father has said to me). There is no deviation, no addition, no subtraction. The Son is the acoustic perfection of the Father’s will. The text closes with the emphatic *outōs lalō* (so I speak). The Incarnation has made the invisible audible; the eternal decree has become a spoken word that grants immortality. Let the Arians be silenced who claim the Son is unlike the Father; for if the speech is exactly *as* the Father said, then the Speaker is of the same substance as the Source. The chapter concludes on the certainty of this divine transmission: from Father to Son, from Son to us, resulting in Life.
