**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και παραγων ειδεν ανθρωπον τυφλ εκ γενετηϲ

**English Translation**
And passing by he saw a man blind from birth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the divine initiative. It is not the blind man who seeks the Physician, but the Physician who, "passing by" in His incarnation, looks upon the ruin of our nature. The text notes he was blind "from birth" (εκ γενετηϲ), signifying that this darkness is not merely a happenstance of life but a condition of our generated nature, inherited from the first Adam. We are born without the vision of God, waiting for the Second Adam to recreate our sight.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και η αυτον οι μαθηται αυτου λεγοντεϲ · ραββει · τιϲ ημαρτεν · ου · η οι γονιϲ αυτου ϊνα τυφλοϲ γεν ·

**English Translation**
And his disciples [asked] him saying: Rabbi, who sinned? This [man], or his parents, that he should be born blind?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciples, trapped in the logic of the law which equates suffering strictly with retribution, interrogate the Lord. They address Him as "Rabbi," acknowledging His authority to judge souls. They propose a dilemma: either the soul sinned before the body (a pagan error) or the parents' sin is visited upon the child. They see a judicial punishment where the Lord sees a vessel for grace.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ουτε ουτοϲ ημαρ ουτε οι γονιϲ αυτου · αλλ ϊνα φα τα εργα του εν αυτω

**English Translation**
He answered: Neither this [man] sinned nor his parents; but that the works of the [God] might be [manifested] in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Lord severs the chain of fatalism. The blindness exists not as a penalty for the past, but as a preparation for the future. The "works" (εργα) must be manifested. The abbreviated text points to the "works of the [God/One]" appearing "in him." The infirmity of the flesh becomes the theatre for the glory of the Spirit. God permits the defect only to supply the perfection.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
η εμε εμε δει εργαζεϲθαι τα εργα του πεμψαν ημαϲ με με εωϲ η εϲτιν · ερχε νυξʼ οτε ουδιϲ δυναται εργαζεϲθαι ·

**English Translation**
[It behooves] me me to work the works of the [one having] sent us me me while it is [day]; night comes when no one is able to work.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript bears the marks of urgency and correction ("me me," "us me me"), emphasizing the singular mission of the Christ. He corrects the plural "us" to the singular "me," for He alone can perform the works of the Father. The "day" is the duration of His earthly ministry and the age of grace; the "night" approaches, signifying the Passion and the judgment, when the opportunity for faith ceases.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
οταν εν τω κοϲμω ῶ . φωϲ ειμι του κο ·

**English Translation**
Whenever I am in the world, I am light of the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He does not say "I have light," but "I am light." His presence constitutes the illumination of the cosmos (του κο). As long as He is present—and He is present now in the Church through the Spirit—the darkness of the "blind from birth" can be dispelled. He is the ontological Sun of Justice.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπ ειπ επτυϲεν χαμαι · και εποιηϲεν πη εκ του πτυϲμα · και επεχριϲεν αυτου τον πηλον επι τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ ·

**English Translation**
Having said said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the clay upon his eyes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Why clay? To remind us of Genesis. God formed man from the dust of the earth; here, Christ the Creator repairs the vessel using the same elemental matter. He mixes the dust with His own spittle (πτυϲμα), infusing the earthly nature with divine virtue. He anoints the eyes, not to blind them further, but to recreate the missing faculty through the contact of His holy flesh.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν αυτω ϋ νιψαι ειϲ τ κολυμβηθραν του ϲιλωαμ ο ερμη απεϲταλ · απηλθεν ουν και ενιψατο και ηλθεν βλεπ ·

**English Translation**
And said to him: Go wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted Sent. Therefore he went away and washed and came seeing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The miracle requires the cooperation of obedience. He is sent to "Siloam," which the Evangelist interprets as "Sent" (απεϲταλ). Christ is the Sent One of the Father. Thus, the blind man washes in the mystery of Christ. He goes in darkness, washes in obedience, and returns "seeing" (βλεπ), a new creation born of water and the Word.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
οι ουν γειτονεϲ και οι θεωρουντεϲ αυτον το προτερ · οτι προϲαιτηϲ ην ελεγον ουχ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο καθημε και προϲαιτ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the neighbors and those beholding him formerly, that he was a beggar, said: Is this not the [one] sitting and begging?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The transformation wrought by grace renders the man unrecognizable to his own neighbors. They knew him as a "beggar" (προϲαιτηϲ), one who sat in need. Now that he stands illuminated, the world doubts his identity. The Christian, once healed of the blindness of sin, becomes a stranger to his former companions.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
αλλοι ελεγον · ουτοϲ εϲτιν · αλλοι δε ελε · ουχι · αλλα ο αυτω εϲτ εϲτ · εκεινοϲ δε δε ελεγ ελεγ οτι οτι εγω ειμι ·

**English Translation**
Others said: This is [he]; but others said: No, but he is like him. But he said said: I am [he].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Confusion reigns among the observers. They can only see a resemblance ("like him"), unable to grasp that the beggar has been fundamentally changed. The man's confession is emphatic, stuttering in the text ("said said," "that that"): "I am." He appropriates his own existence for the first time, affirming the reality of the miracle against the skepticism of the crowd.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ελεγ ελεγ ουν οι ϊουδαιο αυ πωϲ ουν ηνεω ϲου οι ο ˙

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews said said to him: How therefore were your eyes opened?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inquisition begins. The text identifies the questioners specifically as "the Jews" (οι ϊουδαιο), representing the old order that cannot comprehend the newness of life. They do not ask "Who healed you?" but "How?" (πωϲ), seeking a mechanism they can analyze or refute, rather than acknowledging the divine power at work.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
απεκρι εκεινοϲ · ο αν ο λεγομε πηλον ε και επε μου τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ και ειπεν μοι : οτι ϋπα ειϲ τον ϲιλωαμ και νιψαι · απελ ουν · και νι ανεβλε ˙

**English Translation**
That [one] answered: The man the [one] called... made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me: Go into the Siloam and wash; therefore having gone away and washed, I received sight.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The witness is faithful to the facts. He recounts the matter (clay), the action (anointed), and the command (wash). Interestingly, in this reading, the name of Jesus is elided ("The man the one called..."), focusing purely on the humanity of the actor ("the man") and the physical elements. He knows what happened, even if he does not yet fully know Who did it. Faith begins with the experience of healing.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και ειπαν αυτω που εϲτιν εκεινοϲ · λεγει ουκ οιδα ·

**English Translation**
And they said to him: Where is that [man]? He says: I do not know.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world seeks Christ, but only to judge Him. "Where is that one?" they ask. The healed man's ignorance ("I do not know") is a holy ignorance. Christ has withdrawn, as He often does, leaving the work to speak for itself. The man has the gift of sight, but the Giver is hidden, requiring a further journey of faith to find Him.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
α αυτον προϲ τουϲ φαριϲαιουϲ τον ποτε τυφλον ·

**English Translation**
[They lead] him to the Pharisees, the [one] formerly blind.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the transition from the mercy of God to the judgment of men. The text abbreviates the action (`α` for *agousin*), rushing the healed man from the pool of Siloam to the court of the Pharisees. He is designated `τον ποτε τυφλον` (the formerly blind); his identity is forever marked by what he *was*, yet he stands before them as what he *is*. The miracle is dragged before the tribunal of the Law, for grace is often an offense to those who trade in legalities.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ϲαββατον · ε η ημερα τον πη εποιηϲεν ο και ανεωξεν αυ τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ ·

**English Translation**
Now it was Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here lies the crux of the scandal. The scribe notes the `ϲαββατον` (Sabbath) explicitly. The Lord, indicated by the sacred `ο` (*Iesous*), performs a work of creation—making clay (`πη`)—on the day of rest. He does not merely heal by a word, which might escape censure, but engages in labor to reconstruct the organ of sight. He breaks the ritual Sabbath to establish the true Sabbath: the rest of the soul in the light of God.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
παλιν ουν ηρω αυτον και οι φαριϲαιοι πωϲ α · ο δε ει αυτοιϲ πηλ πηλ επεθηκεν μου επι τουϲ οφθαλ και ενιψα και βλεπω ·

**English Translation**
Therefore again the Pharisees also asked him how [he saw]. But he said to them: Clay, clay he placed upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation begins. The man’s testimony is stark and devoid of theological speculation. Note the repetition in the manuscript: `πηλ πηλ` (clay, clay). It is as if the material offense—the earth mixed with spittle—is stuttered in amazement or emphasis. The formula is simple: action (`επεθηκεν`), obedience (`ενιψα`), and result (`βλεπω`). The Pharisees seek a complex legal entrapment; the witness offers only the undeniable fact of his experience.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ελεγαν ελεγον ουν εκ τ φαριϲαιων τινεϲ · ουκ εϲτιν ουτοϲ παρα ο ανθρω · οτι το ϲαββα ου τηρι · αλλοι δε ελεγον · πωϲ δυναται ανθρω αμαρτωλοϲ τοιαυτα ϲημια ποιε ποιε · και ϲχιϲμα ην ε αυτοιϲ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying: This man is not from God, because he does not keep the Sabbath. But others were saying: How is a sinful man able to do such signs? And there was a schism among them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Reason wars against itself. The first group argues *a priori*: a Sabbath-breaker cannot be from God (`παρα ο`). The second group argues *a posteriori*: a sinner cannot perform such signs (`ϲημια`). The repetition of `ποιε` (do/make) emphasizes the magnitude of the act. The result is `ϲχιϲμα` (schism). Truth does not bring peace to falsehood; it brings a sword. The community is divided by the very act intended to make it whole.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
λεγουϲιν ουν τω ποτε τυ παλιν ουν τι ϲυ λεγειϲ περι ϲεαυ · οτι ηνοιξεν ϲου τουϲ οφθαλμουϲ · ο δε ειπεν · οτι προ εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they say to the formerly blind [man] again: What do you say about yourself, that he opened your eyes? But he said: That he is a prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A curious textual turn appears here: `περι ϲεαυ` (about yourself). The Pharisees, perhaps mocking his new agency or seeking to trap him in arrogance, ask for his self-assessment in light of the miracle. Yet, the man deflects the focus from himself. He answers not who *he* is, but who *Jesus* is: `οτι προ εϲτιν` (that he is a prophet). He possesses spiritual sight; he recognizes the divine commission of the Healer, even while the learned scholars remain in the dark.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ουκ ε ουν οι ϊουδαιοι περι αυ · οτι ην τυφλοϲ και ανεβλεψεν · ε οτου εφωνη ο φωνηϲαν εφωνηϲαν τουϲ γονιϲ αυ του αναβλεψ

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind and looked up [saw], until they called the parents of him who looked up.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Disbelief demands an audit of history. They suspect fraud. The manuscript reveals a chaotic stuttering in the scribe's hand: `εφωνη ο φωνηϲαν εφωνηϲαν` (called, called, called). This visual disturbance in the text mirrors the agitation of the council. They summon the parents, hoping to find a discrepancy in the man's origin that will nullify his present restoration.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
και ηρωτηϲαν αυτουϲ ει λεγοντεϲ ουτοϲ εϲ ο ϋμων ον ϋμειϲ λεγεται οτι τυφλοϲ εγεννη · πωϲ ουν βλεπι αρτι ˙

**English Translation**
And they asked them, saying: Is this [the son] of yours, whom you say that he was born blind? How therefore does he see now?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation is threefold: Identity ("Is this yours?"), History ("Was he born blind?"), and Causality ("How does he see?"). The text omits the word for son (`υιος`), reading simply `ο ϋμων` (the of you), reducing the man to a mere object of possession. They challenge the parents to validate the miracle or expose a lie, placing the family under the crushing weight of the Sanhedrin's authority.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲαν ουν οι γονιϲ αυτου και ειπαν · οιδα οτι ουτοϲ εϲ ο ημων και οτι τυφλοϲ εγεν ·

**English Translation**
Therefore his parents answered and said: We know that this is [the son] of us, and that he was born blind.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The parents testify to what is natural: `οιδα` (we know). They confirm his identity and his congenital defect. This closes the door on the theory of fraud regarding the man's history. He was indeed blind. But their knowledge stops at the threshold of the supernatural. They affirm the misery of the past but refuse to interpret the glory of the present.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
πωϲ δε ν ν βλεπει ουκ οιδα · η τιϲ ηνυξ ηνυξ αυτου τουϲ οφθαλ · ημειϲ ου οιδαμεν · αυτοϲ ηλικιαν εχει αυτον ερωτηϲαται ηλικιαν εχει αυτοϲ περι εαυτου λαληϲει ·

**English Translation**
But how he now sees we do not know; or who opened his eyes we do not know. He has age; ask him. He has age; he himself will speak concerning himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Fear produces silence. The repetition of `ηνυξ` (opened) and the double assertion of `ηλικιαν εχει` (he has age) betray their panic. They wash their hands of the testimony. "Ask him," they plead. They abandon their son to the wolves to save their own standing. It is a tragic abdication of parental defense, sacrificing truth for safety.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ταυ ειπαν οι γονιϲ αυτου · οτι εφοβο εφοβο τουϲ ϊουδαιουϲ · ηδη γαρ ϲυνετεθ ϲυνετεθ οι ϊουδαιοι ϊνα εαν τιϲ αυτον ομο αποϲυ γενηται ·

**English Translation**
These things his parents said, because they were fearing the Jews; for already the Jews had agreed, that if anyone should confess him, he would become put out of the synagogue.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The evangelist exposes the motive: terror. The manuscript stammers again—`εφοβο εφοβο` (fearing, fearing) and `ϲυνετεθ ϲυνετεθ` (agreed, agreed). The threat is `αποϲυ` (expulsion from the synagogue), a social and spiritual death sentence. The authorities have weaponized community belonging to suppress the confession of the Christ (`ομο`). Fear of man here strangles the glory of God.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
δια τουτο οι γονιϲ αυτου ειπαν · οτι η εχι αυτον επε :

**English Translation**
Because of this his parents said: That he has [age], ask him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A summary of cowardice. The text abbreviates `ηλικιαν` to `η`, as if even the scribe wishes to pass quickly over this shameful retreat. They point to the son's maturity not to honor him, but to burden him. They leave him alone in the dock.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
εφωνηϲαν ουν τον ανθρωπον εκ δευτερου οϲ ην τυφλοϲ · και ειπαν αυτω · δοϲ δοξαν τω · ημιϲ οιδα οτι ουτοϲ ο ο αμαρτω εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they called the man a second time who was blind, and said to him: Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The confrontation resumes. "Give glory to God" is a solemn oath formula, demanding truth, yet here it is perverted to demand a lie. They claim gnosis—`ημιϲ οιδα` (we know)—setting their theological certainty against the man's experiential reality. They label the Sinless One a `αμαρτω` (sinner). The repetition of `ο` (the man) emphasizes their disdain. They claim to see, yet they are the ones truly blind to the presence of God standing before them.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
απεκρι ουν εκεινοϲ ει αμαρτωλοϲ εϲτ εϲτ ουκ οιδα · εν δε οι οτι τυφλοϲ ων · αρτι βλεπω ·

**English Translation**
He answered then: Whether he is a sinner, I do not know; one thing though I know, that being blind, now I see.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the simplicity of the illuminated soul against the tangled sophistry of the Pharisees. The scribe here repeats the verb *est est* ("is is"), perhaps a slip of the hand, yet it serves to emphasize the reality of the situation: the question of "being." The man does not entangle himself in their definitions of sin; he clings to the undeniable fact of his restored nature. He posits experience against speculation. "One thing I know"—this is the anchor of the faithful. Where the learned see a sinner, the healed man sees only the power of God.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ειπ ειπ ο αυτω παλιν · τι εποιηϲαν εποιηϲεν ϲοι · πωϲ ηνυξεν ϲου τουϲ οφθαλ ·

**English Translation**
They said to him again: What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reveals the confusion of the interrogators through the stuttering of the pen—*eip eip* ("said said") and *epoiesan epoiesen* ("they did / he did"). It is as if the text itself trembles under their harassment. They ask "how" (*pōs*) because they cannot accept the "who." They seek a mechanical explanation for a divine mystery, hoping to find a ritual violation in the method of the cure, for they are blind to the grace of the result.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη αυτοιϲ · ειπον ϋμ ϋμ ηδη και ουκ ηκου · τι παλιν θε ακουειν · μη και θελεται μαθηται αυτου γενεϲθαι ·

**English Translation**
He answered them: I told you already and you did not hear; why again do you wish to hear? Do you not also wish to become his disciples?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is holy irony. The beggar accuses the judges of deafness—*ouk ekou* ("you did not hear")—though their ears are open. He speaks of spiritual hearing. The doubling of *hym hym* ("you you") in the Codex underscores the directness of his charge against their persons. His question, "Do you also wish to become his disciples?" stings them; it implies that their obsession with Jesus betrays a hidden, tormented attraction, or else it exposes their malice as a perverse form of discipleship—following Him only to destroy Him.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
και οι δε ελοι αυτον και ειπαν · ϲυ μα ει εκινου · ημειϲ δε του μω εϲμεν μα ·

**English Translation**
And they reviled him and said: You are a disciple of that one; but we are disciples of Moses.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is fragmented here—*eloi* stands for *eloidoresan* (they reviled)—showing the rupture of charity. They create a schism: Moses against Christ. This is their great error, for Moses wrote of Christ. By claiming to be disciples of Moses (*tou Mō*), they reject the very One Moses foretold. They use the servant (Moses) to lock the door against the Master (Jesus). They cast the healed man as belonging to "that one" (*ekinou*), refusing even to speak the Name.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ημιϲ οιδα · οτι μω λελαληκεν ο · τουτον δε ουκ οι ποθεν ε ·

**English Translation**
We know that to Moses God has spoken; but this one, we do not know from where he is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"We know" (*hēmis oida*) is their refrain, the pride of the Gnostic and the legalist. They claim intimacy with the ancient revelation (*Mō* for Moses, *O* for *Theos*/God) but profess ignorance of the present Living Word. "From where he is" concerns his origin. They admit their ignorance unwittingly; if they knew his origin, they would know he is from the Father. Their "knowledge" is a tomb; the beggar's "ignorance" is the womb of faith.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο ανθρωποϲ και ει αυτοιϲ · εν του γαρ το θαυμαϲτ εϲτιν · οτι ϋμειϲ ου οιδαται ποθεν εϲτιν και ηνοιξ μου τουϲ οφθαλ ·

**English Translation**
The man answered and said to them: For in this is the marvelous thing, that you do not know from where he is, and [yet] he opened my eyes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The unlettered man becomes the teacher of Israel. He points out the *thaumaston* (the marvel/miracle) not just of the healing, but of their blindness. It is a marvel of contradiction: the experts on God cannot recognize the work of God. He connects "being" (*estin*) with "doing" (*ēnoix*). If He does the works of God, He must be from God. The logic is inescapable, and it humiliates the proud.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
οιδαμεν ο αμαρτωλων ο ουκ ακουει · αλ εαν τιϲ θεοϲεβη θεοϲεβηϲ η ῆ · και το θελημα αυτου ποιη · τουτου ακουει ·

**English Translation**
We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will, this one he hears.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The beggar adopts their language—"We know" (*oidamen*)—to dismantle their argument. He cites a universal spiritual law: God (*O*) does not empower those who oppose Him. The scribe's repetition of *theosebē* (God-fearing) emphasizes the quality required for such power. The miracle is not magic; it is an answer to prayer, implying that Jesus is in perfect communion with the Father. If Jesus were a sinner, the heavens would be brass above Him.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
εκ του αι ουκ ηκου · οτι ηνοιξεν τιϲ οφθαλμουϲ τυ γεγεννημε ·

**English Translation**
From the age [began] it was not heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He distinguishes this miracle from all others. Prophets have healed lepers and raised the dead, but to give sight to one born blind (*typhlou gegennēmenou*) is a work of creation, not merely restoration. It belongs to the Creator who formed the eye. *Ek tou ai* (from the age/eternity) indicates that this act is unprecedented in human history, marking the arrival of the Messiah.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ει μη ην ου παρα · ουκ η ποιειν ου ·

**English Translation**
If this one were not from [God], he could do nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is stark and abbreviated here, stripping the argument to its bones. *Ei mē ēn* (if he were not)... *ouk ē* (he could not). It is the final blow to the Pharisees' position. The power (*poiein*) proves the origin (*para [Theou]*). The beggar has constructed a perfect syllogism which the teachers of the law cannot refute with logic, only with violence.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲ απεκριθηϲ και ειπαν αυτω · εν αμαρτιαιϲ ϲυ ε ολοϲ · και ϲυ διδαϲκειϲ ημαϲ · και εξεβαλ εξεβαλ αυτον εξω

**English Translation**
They answered and said to him: In sins you were born entirely, and you teach us? And they cast him out.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Defeated by truth, they resort to power. The manuscript again shows agitation with double writings (*apekrithēs apekrithēs*, *exebal exebal*). They return to the prejudice of the beginning: "In sins you were born entirely" (*holos*). They judge his physical birth as a sign of spiritual reprobation, while they, born in pride, believe themselves whole. They cast him out (*exō*) of the synagogue, but in doing so, they cast him into the arms of the Church.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και η ο ο οτι εξε αυτον εξω · και ευρων αυτον ειπεν αυτω · ϲυ πιϲτευ ειϲ τον του ανθρωπου ·

**English Translation**
And [Jesus] heard that they cast him out; and finding him he said to him: Do you believe in the [Son] of Man?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Good Shepherd seeks the sheep that the hirelings have rejected. The Greek *ē o o* is a garbled contraction for "Jesus heard." The question Jesus poses is the ultimate test: "Do you believe?" The Codex reads *eis ton tou anthrōpou* ("into the of the man"), elliptically omitting *uion* (Son), yet the meaning is the Messianic title. He asks for personal allegiance, not just theological assent regarding a prophet.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
απε εκινοϲ και ειπεν κ(αι) τιϲ εϲτ εϲτ ϊνα πιϲτευϲω ειϲ αυ ·

**English Translation**
That one answered and said: And who is he, that I might believe in him?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The soul is ready. The man asks "And who is he?" (*kai tis est*). The inclusion of *kai* (and) suggests an immediate, eager continuation of the dialogue. He does not know the face of his benefactor, for he was blind when he was sent to Siloam. He has the will to believe (*hina pisteusō*); he only awaits the revelation of the Object. Faith here is shown as a response to the revealed Word.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
εφη αυτω ο και εωρακαϲ αυτ αυτ και ο λαλων με ϲου · εκεινοϲ ε ·

**English Translation**
He said to him the [One]: And you have seen him [him], and the one speaking with you, that one is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the text before us. The scribe has omitted the Sacred Name (*Nomina Sacra*), leaving only the article `ο` (the), yet the presence of the Lord is undeniable. There is a stammering in the ink, `αυτ αυτ` (him him), as if the magnitude of the revelation causes the hand to tremble. The Lord identifies Himself not merely as a vision seen (`εωρακαϲ`) but as the Logos currently communing (`λαλων`) with the beggar. The phrase `με ϲου` (with you) is intimate; the Creator speaks with the clay He has just enlightened. "That one is" (`εκεινοϲ ε`)—this is the identification of the Messiah, present in the flesh, no longer hidden in types and shadows.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ο δε εφη πιϲτευω και προϲεκυνηϲεν αυτω

**English Translation**
And he said, "I believe," and he worshiped him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the brevity of true conversion. There is no elaboration, no demand for signs. The text provided here is stark; unlike other copies which add "Lord" (`κυριε`), this Codex reads simply `πιϲτευω` ("I believe"). It is the raw, unadorned assent of the soul. Immediately, theology becomes liturgy: `προϲεκυνηϲεν` (he worshiped). Faith that does not bend the knee is no faith at all. The beggar, formerly sitting in darkness, now prostrates himself before the Light of the World.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
και ειπεν · ειϲ κριμα εγω ειϲ τον κοϲμον τουτον ηλθον · ϊνα οι μη βλεποντεϲ βλεπωϲιν · και οι βλεποντεϲ τυ γενωνται ·

**English Translation**
And he said: For judgment I into this world came; that those not seeing might see; and those seeing blind might become.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks of `κριμα` (judgment), not as a future event alone, but as a present reality brought by the Incarnation. The entry of Light necessarily separates. Note the scribe's abbreviation `τυ` for `τυφλοι` (blind). The word is cut short, just as the spiritual sight of the arrogant is curtailed. It is a terrifying paradox: the humility of physical blindness prepares one for spiritual sight, while the presumption of sight ("those seeing") leads to the permanent darkness of the soul. He came not only to save but to expose the void within the self-righteous.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
η εκ των φαριϲαιων ταυτα οι με αυτου οντεϲ · και ειπαν αυτω μη και ημειϲ τυφλοι εϲμεν ·

**English Translation**
[Heard] from the Pharisees these things, those being with him, and they said to him: Not also are we blind?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verse begins abruptly with `η`, likely a vestige of `ηκουσαν` (they heard), indicating the Pharisees were hovering, listening with malice. They are described as `οι με αυτου οντεϲ` (those being with him)—physically near the Christ, yet miles distant in spirit. Their question expects a negative answer ("Surely we are not blind?"). It is the protest of offended pride. They do not ask to be healed; they demand their wellness be affirmed. They stand in the presence of the Physician and claim they have no need of Him, which is the very definition of their sickness.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν αυ ο · ει τυφλοι ητε · ουκ αν ειχετε αμαρτιαν · νυν δε λεγετε οτι βλεπο η αμαρτια ϋ μενει αι αμαρτιαι ϋμων μενουϲιν η αμαρτια ϋμων μενει :

**English Translation**
Said to them the [Jesus]: If blind you were, not would you have sin; but now you say that "I see"; the sin of you remains; the sins of you remain; the sin of you remains.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Look closely at the parchment, for here is a great mystery and a scribal wonder! The condemnation is tripled. The text reads `η αμαρτια ϋ μενει` (the sin of you remains), then `αι αμαρτιαι ϋμων μενουϲιν` (the sins of you remain), and again `η αμαρτια ϋμων μενει` (the sin of you remains). Whether by error or divine emphasis, the Codex seals their fate three times. Their claim `βλεπο` (I see)—truncated from `βλεπομεν`—is the seal of their doom. Because they claim competence, they reject grace. The repetition in the manuscript echoes like a hammer striking a nail: their sin remains, their sins remain, their sin remains. It is fixed, immovable, and terrifyingly permanent.
