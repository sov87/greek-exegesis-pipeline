**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
μη ταραϲϲεϲθω ϋμων η καρδια · πι ειϲ τον και ειϲ εμε πι ·

**English Translation**
Let not your heart be troubled; believe into the [One], and into me believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the remedy for the soul's turbulence: it is faith doubled yet unified. The text abbreviates the command to believe (*pi* for *pisteuete*), urging haste in its application. The first object of faith is "the [One]"—implied by the article *ton* to be God the Father—and the second is the Son Himself. By placing Himself alongside the Father as the object of the same verb, the Lord asserts His equality in dignity. Do not let the heart waver, for the anchor is cast into the dual nature of the one divine authority.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
εν τη οι του πατροϲ μου μοναι πολλαι ειϲ ειϲ · ει δε μη ειπον ϋ οτι πορευο ετοιμαϲαι το ·

**English Translation**
In the house of my Father are many dwelling-places; but if not, I would have told you that I go to prepare a place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "house" (*oikia*) signifies the vast economy of the Kingdom, governed by the Father. The text here stammers with *eis eis* (are are), emphasizing the certainty of existence. These "dwelling-places" (*monai*) suggest distinct degrees of spiritual repose or glory, yet all within the same paternal enclosure. He goes to "prepare," not because the heavens are unfinished, but to open the access for human flesh, which He bears, into the Holy of Holies.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και εαν πορευθω και ετοι τοπον ϋμ ϋμ · παλιν ερχομαι και παραλημψο ϋμαϲ προϲ ε · οπου ειμι εγω · και ητε ·

**English Translation**
And if I go and prepare a place for you, again I come and will receive you to myself; where I am, [there] also you may be.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the repetition *hum hum* (for you, for you); the Lord’s departure is entirely for our sake. The promise is twofold: a departure to prepare and a return to receive. He does not say He will take us to a "place" merely, but *pros e*—"to myself." The location of heaven is defined by the presence of the Person of Christ. Our final rest is not a geography, but a relationship; to be where He is, in the bosom of the Father.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
και οπου εγω ϋπαγω οιδατε τ τ οδον ·

**English Translation**
And where I go, you know the way.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord attributes knowledge to the disciples which they do not yet realize they possess. The scribe’s stutter on the article (*t t* for *ten*) reflects the hesitation of the human mind to grasp this truth. They know the Way because they know Him, yet they have not yet connected that His very flesh, broken and ascended, is the path to the Father. He asserts their knowledge to provoke their inquiry.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω θωμαϲ · ουκ οι που ϋπα · και πωϲ την οδον ειδεναι δυ ·

**English Translation**
Thomas says to him: We do not know where you go; and how are we able to know the way?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Thomas speaks for the earth-bound mind, seeking a destination on a map (*pou*) before trusting the guide. He confesses ignorance regarding the goal, and thus despair regarding the route. It is the cry of natural reason which cannot perceive that the destination (the Father) and the route (the Son) are revealed in the same mystery. He asks "how are we able" (*du* for *dunametha*), acknowledging human incapacity.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυ · εγω ειμι η οδοϲ · και η αληθει · και η ζωη · ουδιϲ ερχεται προϲ τον πατερα ει μη δι ε ·

**English Translation**
He says to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the summit of theology. He does not show the way; He *is* the Way. He does not teach the truth; He *is* the Truth. He does not give life; He *is* the Life. The exclusivity is absolute: *oudeis* (no one). The preposition *di e* (through me) establishes the Son as the sole Mediator. To bypass the Son is to miss the Father, for the Father has willed to be approachable only through the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ει εγνωκατε εμε · και τον πατε μου γνωϲε · και απ αρτι γνωϲεϲθαι αυτον και εωρακαται αυ ·

**English Translation**
If you have known me, also my Father you will know; and from now you know him and have seen him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The knowledge of the Son is the knowledge of the Father, proving they are of one substance (*homoousios*). The text shifts tenses: "you will know" becomes "you know" and "have seen." The phrase "from now" (*ap arti*) indicates that the Incarnation has rendered the invisible God visible. In seeing the Son’s works and passion, the disciples have gazed upon the Father’s very nature—love and power.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ο φιλιπποϲ · · δειξ ημιν τον πατερα · και αρκει ημιν ·

**English Translation**
Philip says to him: Show us the Father, and it suffices for us.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Philip, like Moses, desires a direct theophany, a vision of the naked glory of God, thinking this will suffice. He fails to understand that the flesh of Jesus is the veil through which the glory shines. The double punctuation (· ·) marks a pause of profound misunderstanding. Philip separates the Father from the Son, seeking the Archetype while ignoring the Image standing before him.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
λε αυτω ο · τοϲου χρονω τοϲουτον χρονον τοϲουτω χρονω μεθ υ ειμι · και ου εγνωκαϲ με φι · ο εωρακωϲ εμε · εωρακεν τ πατερα · πωϲ ϲυ λε οτι δειξον η τον πατερα ·

**English Translation**
The [Jesus] says to him: For so much time, so long a time, for so much time am I with you, and you have not known me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father; how do you say: Show us the Father?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here bears witness to a struggle, repeating "so much time" in three different grammatical forms (*tosou chrono*, *tosouton chronon*, *tosouto chrono*), as if the Lord is emphasizing the duration of His patience or the scribe is overwhelmed by the weight of the rebuke. The theological axiom is delivered: Vision of the Son is vision of the Father. To ask for more is to deny the fullness of the revelation in Christ.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ου πιϲτευειϲ οτι εγω εν τω πατρι · και ο πατηρʼ εν ε εϲτιν : τα ρηματα α εγω λαλω ϋμιν · απ ε ου λαλω · ο δε πατηρʼ ο εν ε μενων · ποι τα εργα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Do you not believe that I [am] in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words which I speak to you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who abides in me does his works.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the doctrine of *perichoresis*—mutual indwelling. The Son is not a separate agent acting alongside the Father, but acts from within the Father's essence. Note the shift: Christ speaks of "words" (*rhemata*), but attributes them to the Father doing "works" (*erga*). In God, speech is action. The Father abiding in the Son is the dynamic source of all the miracles and teachings Philip has witnessed.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
πι μοι οτι εγω εν τω πατρι · και ο πατηρ εν εμοι · ει δε μη δια τα εργα αυ πιϲτευετε :

**English Translation**
Believe me that I [am] in the Father and the Father in me; but if not, on account of the works themselves believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord offers two paths to faith. The higher path is to "believe me"—to trust His person and His claim of unity with the Father. The lower, yet valid path, is to believe "on account of the works" (*dia ta erga*). If the mind cannot grasp the theology of indwelling, let the eyes grasp the reality of the miracles. Both paths lead to the same salvation, but the former is the way of the friend, the latter the way of the servant.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν ο πιϲτευων ειϲ εμε τα εργα α ε ποιω · κακει ποιηϲει · και μειζονα τουτων ποιηϲει · οτι εγω προϲ τον πατερα πορευομαι ·

**English Translation**
Amen, amen, I say to you, he who believes into me, the works which I do, that one also shall do; and greater than these shall he do; because I go to the Father.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful and glorious promise. The believer is incorporated into the Son's agency. "Greater" (*meizona*) refers not to power—for what is greater than raising Lazarus?—but to the scope and extension of the Gospel through the Spirit. Because Christ goes to the Father to reign, His power is no longer localized in Galilee but poured out upon all flesh. The Church's mission is the continuation of Christ's works, magnified by His enthronement.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και ο τι ανʼ αιτηϲητε τω ονοματι μου · τουτο ποιηϲω · ϊ δοξαϲθη ο πα εν τω ϋϊω ˙

**English Translation**
And whatever you ask in my name, this I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the unity of operation between the Father (*πα*) and the Son (*ϋϊω*). The Son does not say "I will ask and another will do," but "I will do" (*ποιηϲω*), asserting His own power to fulfill the petitions of the faithful. Yet, the end of this power is not self-aggrandizement, but that the Father may be glorified *in* the Son. The Name of the Son is the instrument of the Father’s glory; to pray in this Name is to align one’s will with the divine economy.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ε ε τι αιτηϲητε με εν τω ονοματι μου εγω ποιηϲω :

**English Translation**
If [if] you ask me anything in my name, I will do [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stammers (*ε ε*) upon the condition, yet the theology is precise. Note the inclusion of *με* ("ask **me**"). It is not merely asking God generally, but asking the Son specifically. The emphatic *εγω* ("I") confirms that the Son is the agent of the answer. He is not merely the mediator who carries the request; He is the Lord who executes the answer. This refutes those who would make the Son a creature without power of His own.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
εαν αγαπατε με · ταϲ εν ταϲ εμαϲ τηρηϲητε ·

**English Translation**
If you love me, keep my commandments [lit: the com... the mine].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Love is here defined not by emotion but by obedience. The text abbreviates "commandments" (*εν*), perhaps hastening to the verb *τηρηϲητε* (keep). To love the Word is to keep the word. There is no separation between affection for the Person of Christ and submission to the precepts of Christ. The "mine" (*εμαϲ*) emphasizes that these laws are issued by Jesus Himself, holding equal weight to the Law of Sinai.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
καγω τηρηϲω ερωτηϲω τον πατε · και αλλον παρα δωϲει ϋ · ϊνα μεθ υμ ῆ ειϲ τον αιωνα ·

**English Translation**
And I will keep [ask] the Father, and another Comforter he will give to you, that he may be with you into the age.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see a correction in the manuscript: the scribe first wrote *τηρηϲω* ("I will keep," echoing verse 15) but corrects it to *ερωτηϲω* ("I will ask"). The Son asks, demonstrating His distinction from the Father; the Father gives, demonstrating their unity of will. The Spirit is called *αλλον* (another), implying that Jesus was the first Comforter (*παρα*). The Spirit’s presence is not temporary, like the Incarnation's visible phase, but *ειϲ τον αιωνα* (into the age/forever).

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
το π π τηϲ αληθι ο ον ο ο κοϲμοϲ ου δυ λαβειν · οτι ου θεωρει αυτο αυτον αυτο · ου γινωϲκει · ϋμιϲ γεινωϲκετε αυτο · ο παρ ϋμιν μενει · και εν ϋμιν εϲται ·

**English Translation**
The Spirit [Spirit] of truth, whom the world is not able to receive, because it does not behold him [him him] nor know [him]; but you know him, because he remains with you and will be in you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is fraught with trembling—*π π* (Spirit Spirit), *ο ο* (whom whom), *αυτο αυτον αυτο* (him him him)—as if the scribe struggles to contain the mystery of the Pneumatos. The distinction is made between "beholding" (*θεωρει*) and "knowing" (*γινωϲκει*). The world relies on ocular sight and thus fails; the Church relies on interior knowledge. The preposition shifts from *παρ* (with) to *εν* (in), signifying the movement from external companionship to internal indwelling.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ουκ αφηϲω ϋμαϲ ορ ερχομαι προϲ ϋμαϲ ·

**English Translation**
I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The word *ορ* (orphans) is poignant. It casts the disciples as children dependent on a father. By saying "I am coming" (*ερχομαι*) in the present tense, He indicates that His departure is not an abandonment. He returns in the Resurrection, He returns in the Spirit, and He returns at the end of the age. The departure is the condition for a new, more intimate mode of presence.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ετι μι και ο κοϲμοϲ με ουκετι θεωρει · ϋμειϲ δε θεωρει με · οτι εγω ζω ˙ και ϋμειϲ ζηϲε ˙

**English Translation**
Yet a little [while] and the world beholds me no longer; but you behold me; because I live, and you will live.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world's vision is terminated by the tomb; it sees only dead flesh. The disciple's vision pierces death. Why? *οτι εγω ζω* ("Because I live"). The life of the Christian is contingent entirely upon the life of the Christ. It is a derivative immortality. We live only because He lives. The abbreviation *ζηϲε* (you will live) points to the future resurrection guaranteed by His own.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
εν εκινη τη ημε · γνωϲεϲθαι ϋμιϲ · οτι εγω εν τω πα μου · και ϋμιϲ ε εμοι · καγω εν ϋ :

**English Translation**
In that day, you will know that I [am] in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the summary of the divine mystery: *Perichoresis*. First, the Son in the Father (*εν τω πα*). Second, the faithful in the Son (*ε εμοι*). Third, the Son in the faithful (*εν ϋ*). This chain links the dust of humanity to the unapproachable light of the Father through the bridge of the Son. "That day" refers to the coming of the Spirit, who reveals this union which is otherwise invisible to the eye.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ο εχων ταϲ εντο μου και τηρ τηρ αυταϲ · εκεινοϲ ε ο αγαπων με · ο δε αγαπων με · αγαπηθηϲεται ϋ του πατροϲ μου · καγω αγαπηϲω αυτον · και εμφα αυτω εμαυ :

**English Translation**
He who has my commandments and keeps [keeps] them, that one is he who loves me; and he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe stutters on "keeping" (*τηρ τηρ*), emphasizing the labor of obedience. Possession of the commandments is not enough; one must guard them. The promise here is specific: *εμφα* (manifest). This is not the public revelation to the world, but a private, spiritual manifestation of the Son to the soul that loves Him. The Father's love flows to those who love the Son, proving the indivisibility of the Godhead.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ϊουδαϲ ουχ ο ϊϲκαριωτηϲ · · και τι γεγονεν · οτι ημιν μελλειϲ εμφανιζειν ϲε · και ουχι τω κοϲμω ˙

**English Translation**
Judas says to him, not the Iscariot: And what has happened that you are about to manifest yourself to us and not to the world?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The disciple is confused by the exclusivity of the revelation. He expects a Messiah who conquers the *κοϲμω* (world) with visible power. He asks "what has happened" (*τι γεγονεν*), thinking the plan has changed. He does not yet understand that the Kingdom is not of this world, and that spiritual manifestation requires eyes prepared by love, which the world lacks.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ειπεν αυτω αυτοιϲ αυτω · εαν τιϲ αγαπα με · τον λογον μου τη · και ο πατηρ μου αγαπηϲει αυ · και προϲ αυτ ελευϲομεθα · και μο παρ αυτω ποι ·

**English Translation**
[Jesus] answered and said to him [to them to him]: If anyone loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and to him we will come, and an abode with him we will make.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript reveals a confusion of audience—*αυτω αυτοιϲ αυτω* (to him, to them, to him)—moving from the individual Judas to the group, and back to the singular believer. The promise is the indwelling of the Trinity: "We will come" (*ελευϲομεθα*). Not just the Spirit, nor just the Son, but the Father also. They make a *μο* (abode/mansion) in the human heart. The believer becomes the new Temple.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ο μη α με · τουϲ λο μου ου τηρει ˙ και ο λογοϲ ον ακου · ουκ εϲτιν εμοϲ · αλλα του πεμψαν με πατροϲ

**English Translation**
He who does not love me does not keep my words; and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The negative corollary. Lack of obedience (*ου τηρει*) is the evidence of a lack of love (*μη α*). Jesus clarifies the authority of His teaching: it is not *εμοϲ* (mine) in isolation, but belongs to the *πατροϲ* (Father). Therefore, to reject the words of Jesus is not merely to reject a man or a prophet, but to reject the Father Himself. The unity of the Word and the Speaker is absolute.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ταυ λελαληκα υμιν · παρ υμιν μεν μεν ·

**English Translation**
These things I have spoken to you; while remaining, remaining with you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal repetition, *menōn menōn* ("remaining, remaining"). While the copyist’s hand may tremble, the theology stands firm. The Lord emphasizes His abiding presence in the flesh before His departure. He speaks "these things" (*tauta*)—the mysteries of the indwelling God—while He is still visible to their eyes. The duplication serves to underscore the duration and the intimacy of this final discourse; He lingers, unwilling to leave His beloved until the doctrine is sealed within them.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
ο δε παρακλητοϲ πεμψει το π το αγιον το π το αγιον ον πεμψι ο πατηρʼ εν τω ονοματι μου · εκεινοϲ ϋμαϲ δι παντα · και ϋ ϋμαϲ παντα · ἁ ειπον ϋ :

**English Translation**
But the Paraclete will send the Spirit the Holy, the Spirit the Holy, whom the Father will send in my name; that one will teach you all things; and will remind you of all things which I said to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We confront here a difficult reading, brethren. The text reads *pempsei* ("will send") immediately after "Paraclete," suggesting "The Paraclete will send the Holy Spirit." Yet, it continues "whom the Father will send." We see the scribal struggle in the repetition of *to pneuma to hagion* ("the Spirit the Holy"). We must read this through the lens of the Triune unity: The Father sends, the Son asks, and the Spirit comes. The abbreviated verbs *di* (for *didaxei*, "will teach") and *hu* (for *hupomnēsei*, "will remind") point to the two-fold office of the Spirit: illumination of new understanding and preservation of revealed memory. He does not bring a new Gospel, but brings to remembrance the words of the Word.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ειρηνην αφιημι ϋμιν · ειρηνην τ τ εμην διδωμι ϋμ ϋμ · ου καθωϲ ο κοϲμοϲ διδωϲιν ϋμιν εγω διδωμι · μη ταραϲϲεϲθω η καρδια · μηδε δι ·

**English Translation**
Peace I leave to you; peace the the my I give to you you; not as the world gives to you I give. Let not the heart be troubled; nor let it fear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering of the quill—*tēn tēn* ("the the") and *humin humin* ("to you to you")—betrays the overwhelming magnitude of the gift. This is not the peace of treaties or ceasefires, which the world gives sparingly and revokes easily. It is *eirēnēn tēn emēn* ("peace the my [peace]"), the very tranquility that exists between the Father and the Son. The final abbreviation *di* stands for *deiliatō* ("let it be cowardly/fearful"). The command is absolute: in the face of the coming Cross, cowardice is banished by the divine gift.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
ηκουϲατε ο εγω ειπον ϋμιν · ϋπαγω και ερχο προϲ · ει ηγαπατε με · εχα αν · οτι πορευ προϲ τον πα · οτι ο πατηρ μου μου μειζων μου εϲτ εϲτ ·

**English Translation**
You heard that I said to you: I go away and I come to [you]. If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; because the Father my my is is greater than I.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the text that crushes the Sabellians and challenges the Arians. The Lord says *poreuomai* ("I go") to the Father, indicating distinction of persons. He declares the Father *meizōn* ("greater"), referring to the Father as the unbegotten Source of the Godhead, while the Son is begotten. The scribe, perhaps in awe of this mystery, writes *mou mou* ("my my") and *estin estin* ("is is"). We rejoice not because the Son is inferior in nature—God forbid—but because He returns to the glory that is His birthright, taking our humanity with Him into the very heart of the *Pater*.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
και νυν ειρηκα ϋ πριν γενεϲθε · ϊν οταν γενηται πιϲτευϲητε ·

**English Translation**
And now I have told you before it happens; so that when it happens you might believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Prophecy is the seal of divinity. He speaks to *humin* (abbreviated *ϋ*) before the Passion (*prin genesthai*) so that the trauma of the Cross does not destroy their faith, but rather confirms it. When they see the Shepherd struck, they will remember He foretold it, transforming the scandal of the crucifixion into a proof of His omniscience. Faith (*pisteusēte*) is the fruit of memory sanctified by prediction.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ουκ ε πολλα λαληϲω μεθ ϋμων · ερχε γαρ ο του κοϲμου αρχων . και εν εμοι ουκ εχει ουδεν ·

**English Translation**
No longer many things will I speak with you; for the ruler of the world comes. And in me he has nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The time for teaching (*polla lalēsō*) draws to a close; the time for combat begins. The "ruler of the world" (*archōntou kosmou*)—the Devil—approaches in the person of Judas and the soldiers. Yet observe the Lord’s sinlessness: "in me he has nothing." There is no hook of sin in Christ for the Devil to snag. The Enemy comes to attack, but finds no foothold of corruption. It is a voluntary surrender, not a defeat.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
αλ ϊνα γνω ο κοϲμοϲ · οτι αγαπω τον πα · και καθωϲ ε μοι ο πα · ουτωϲ ποιω ˙ εγειρεϲθε αγωμ αγωμ εντευθεν :

**English Translation**
But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father [commanded] me, so I do. Arise, let us go, let us go from here.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter concludes with supreme obedience. The abbreviation *ε* likely stands for *eneteilato* ("commanded") or *edōken* ("gave"). The Son’s action is the mirror of the Father’s will. The final double command, *agōmen agōmen* ("let us go, let us go"), recorded by this scribe, captures the urgency of the hour. He does not wait for death to find Him; He marches out to meet it. He leads the disciples from the Upper Room toward Gethsemane, moving from the table of communion to the garden of agony. The discourse is finished; the sacrifice begins.
