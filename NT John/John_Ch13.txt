**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
προ δε τηϲ εορτηϲ του παϲχα · ειδωϲ ο · οτι ηλθεν αυτου η ωρα · ϊνα μετα εκ του κοϲμου τουτου προϲ τον πατερα · αγαπηϲαϲ τουϲ ϊουδαιουϲ ϊδιουϲ τουϲ εν τω κοϲμω ειϲ τελοϲ ηγαπηϲεν αυ

**English Translation**
Before the feast of the Pascha; knowing [Jesus] that his hour came; that [he should depart] out of this world to the Father; having loved the Jews, his own in the world, to the end he loved th[em].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here a singular reading of our Codex: the scribe has written *tous ioudaious idious* ("the Jews, his own"). Where others might read simply "his own," this text emphasizes the Lord's fidelity to the lineage of Abraham. He loved the Jews who were His own—those of the circumcision who received Him. The abbreviated *meta* indicates the swiftness of His necessary departure (*metabē*). He knew the hour; the cosmos could no longer contain the Infinite. His love reaches *eis telos*—not merely to the end of time, but to the uttermost limit of love's capacity.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και διπνου γεινομενου γενομενου · του διαβολου ηδη βε ειϲ τ τ καρδιαν παρα παραδω αυτον ϊουδαϲ ϲιμωνοϲ

**English Translation**
And supper happening happening; the devil already [having put] into t- the heart that Judas of Simon [should] betr- betray him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here stammers, repeating *geinomenou genomenou* and *para paradō*, as if the scribe himself trembles at the enormity of the betrayal. The devil has cast (*beblēkotos*, abbreviated as *be*) his seed into the heart. Note the syntax: the devil puts the intent into the heart, but Judas of Simon is named as the agent. The supper is "happening"—it is the present reality of communion, yet simultaneously, the reality of perdition is being sown. The duplication of words mirrors the duplicity of the traitor.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ϊδωϲ οτι π εδωκεν αυτω ο πατηρʼ ειϲ ταϲ χι · και οτι απο εξηλθεν · και προϲ τον ˙

**English Translation**
Knowing that [all things] the Father gave to him into the ha[nds]; and that from [God] he came out; and to the [God he goes].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred abbreviations (nomina sacra) and truncations here are profound. *Pi* stands for *panta* (all things)—the totality of creation rests in the *chi* (hands) of the Son. The text says he came out *apo* (from)—implying his origin in the Father's substance—and goes *pros ton* (to the [God/Father]). The omission of the divine Name in the final clause speaks to the apophatic mystery: He returns to that which is beyond naming. He holds all power, yet proceeds to the humblest act.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
εγει εκ του διπνου · και τιθηϲιν τα · και λαβων λεν διεζωϲεν ε ·

**English Translation**
He ri[ses] from the supper; and places the [garments]; and taking a lin[en] he girded h[imself].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He rises (*egeiretai*)—a verb of resurrection used here for an act of service. He "places" his garments; he lays aside his glory, the form of God, to take the form of a servant. The *lention* (linen towel) is the vestment of the slave. By girding himself (*eauton*, abbreviated *e*), He binds the strength of the Godhead into the constraint of human servitude. The brevity of the text mirrors the silent efficiency of His action.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
ειτα βαλλει ϋδωρʼ ειϲ τον νιπτη · και ηρξατο νι τουϲ ποδαϲ των μαθητων · κ(αι) εκμαϲϲειν τω λεν . ω ην διεζωϲ ·

**English Translation**
Then he puts water into the basi[n]; and began to wa[sh] the feet of the disciples; and to wipe [them] with the lin[en] with which he was gird[ed].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Creator handles the element of water which He created. He puts it into the *niptera* (basin). He touches the feet—the lowest part of the body, in contact with the dust of the earth. The act of wiping (*ekmassein*) signifies the removal of the world's stain. He uses the very linen with which He is girded, implying that His own person, His own preparation, is the instrument of their cleansing.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ερχεται ουν προϲ ϲιμω πετρον · και λεγι αυτω εκι εκινοϲ ϲυ μου νιπτιϲ τουϲ ποδαϲ ·

**English Translation**
He comes therefore to Simo[n] Peter; and sa[ys] to him th- that one: You wash my feet?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text again exhibits a stutter or emphatic doubling: *eki ekinos* ("that one, that one"). It highlights Peter's shock. "That one"—Peter—confronts the Living God. The order of words is crucial: *Su mou* (You... my?). The juxtaposition of the creature and the Creator. Peter cannot fathom that the hands which hold "all things" (Verse 3) now hold his soiled feet.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
απε και ειπ αυτω α ο εγω ποιω ϲυ ουκ οιδαϲ αρτι · γνωϲη δε μετα ταυτα ·

**English Translation**
Ans[wered] and said to him [Jesus]: What I do you do not know now; but you will know after these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord admits the mystery. The abbreviation *a o* likely stands for the response of Jesus. The act is sacramental; its outward form (washing) conceals an inward grace (humility and purification) that Peter cannot intellectually grasp *arti* (just now). Knowledge (*gnōsē*) is promised *meta tauta*—after the Cross and Resurrection. Only through the lens of the Passion does the service of the Master make sense.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω πετροϲ · ου μη νι τουϲ ποδαϲ μου ειϲ τον αιω · απεκριθη αυ ο · εαν μη νι ϲε · ουκ εχειϲ μεροϲ μετ εμου ·

**English Translation**
Says to him Peter: You shall certainly not wa[sh] my feet into the a[ge]; Answered hi[m] Jesus: If I do not wa[sh] thee, thou hast no part with me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter's refusal is absolute: *eis ton aiōna* (into the age/forever). It is a piety born of pride. The Lord's retort is terrifying in its brevity. "If I do not wash (*ni*) thee." It is not merely the feet; it is the person. Unless one submits to the cleansing of Christ, accepting His humiliation as our salvation, there is no *meros* (portion/inheritance) in the Kingdom. We must allow God to serve us, that we may serve Him.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ϲιμ πετροϲ · μη τουϲ ποδαϲ μου μο · αλλα και ταϲ χιραϲ και την κε ·

**English Translation**
Says to him Sim[on] Peter: Not my feet on[ly], but also the ha[nds] and the he[ad].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter swings from refusal to excess. If washing grants a portion with Christ, he desires total immersion. He offers his hands (*chiras*)—his works—and his head (*kephalēn*)—his intellect. He does not yet understand that the cleansing is specific and spiritual, not a physical bath. His zeal is commendable, but his understanding is carnal.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ο · ο λελουμενοϲ ουκ εχι εχει χρειαν νι · αλλα εϲτιν καθαροϲ ολοϲ · και ϋμειϲ καθαροι εϲτε · αλλ ουχι παντεϲ ·

**English Translation**
Says to him Jesus: The one having been bathed has no need to wa[sh], but is clean wholly; and ye are clean, but not all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Attend closely to the Sinaiticus reading! It reads: *ouk echei chreian ni* (has no need to wash). It **omits** the phrase found in other copies: "save for his feet." In this Codex, the Lord declares a radical purity. The one bathed (in baptism) is *katharos holos* (wholly clean). He does not need a second washing. The footwashing, then, is not a second baptism, but a lesson in humility for the already-clean. Yet, a dark exception remains: "but not all." Purity of the body does not guarantee purity of the heart if treason lurks within.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ηδει γαρ τον παρα αυτον · δια τουτο ειπεν ουχι παντεϲ κα εϲτε ˙

**English Translation**
For he knew the one betra[ying] him; on account of this he said: Not all cle[an] are ye.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist explains the exception. The Lord's omniscience (*ēdei*) penetrates the soul of Judas. Judas was physically washed by Jesus, yet he remains unclean. This proves that sacraments require faith; water touches the body, but the Word must cleanse the conscience. The abbreviation *ka* stands for *katharoi* (clean). Judas is the spot in the feast, the unclean among the wholly clean.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
οτε ο ενιψεν τουϲ πο αυτων · ελαβ τα ϊματια αυτων αυτου και ανεπεϲεν αναπεϲων πα ειπεν αυτοιϲ · γεινωϲκεται τι πεποιηκα ϋμιν ·

**English Translation**
When [therefore] he washed the fe[et] of them, [he] took the garments of [him] and reclined reclining ag[ain] he said to them: Do ye know what I have done to you?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text corrects itself: *autōn* (their garments) to *autou* (his garments). He resumes His glory. *Anepesen anapesōn* (reclined reclining) emphasizes the deliberate return to the position of the Master. He asks, *Ginōskete* (Do ye know?). The action is finished, but the understanding has hardly begun. He has inverted the social order of the cosmos to establish the law of love.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ϋμιϲ φωνειτε με · ο διδαϲκαλοϲ και ο · και καλωϲ λεγεται · ειμι γαρ ·

**English Translation**
You call me: The Teacher and the [Lord]; and well you say; for I am.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the order of titles. You address me first as *Didaskalos* (Teacher), for you learn from me, and then as the Sovereign, for you obey me. The text here presents a stark brevity: *kai ho* ("and the..."). The title is assumed, for the Lordship is absolute. The final clause, *eimi gar* ("for I am"), resonates with the Divine Name. It is not merely a copula of existence, but an affirmation of Being.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν εγω ενιψα ϋμων τουϲ ποδαϲ · ο και ο διδαϲκα · και ϋμειϲ οφι νιπτειν αλ τουϲ ποδ ποδαϲ ·

**English Translation**
If therefore I washed your feet—the [Lord] and the Teacher—also you ought to wash one another's feet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The argument proceeds *a fortiori*. If the Greater (the *Kyrios* and *Didaskalos*) descends to the menial task of the slave, the lesser cannot claim exemption. The scribe’s stutter in the text—*tous pod podas*—emphasizes the physical reality of the feet. We must not spiritualize this command into abstraction; the dust is real, and the cleansing is a debt (*opheilete*) we owe to the brethren.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ϋποδιγμα γαρ δεδωκα · ϊνα καθωϲ εγω εποι · και ποιηται

**English Translation**
For an example I gave, that just as I did, [so] also you do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ provides a *hypodeigma*—a pattern to be traced or copied. He does not merely give a law (*nomos*) but a prototype of action. The grammar links His doing (*epoi*) directly to our doing (*poiētai*). The Christian life is mimetic; we are to be icons of His humility in the world.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν ουκ εϲτιν δουλοϲ μιζων του αυτου · ουδε απο μειζων του πεμψαντοϲ αυτ αυτ ·

**English Translation**
Amen amen I say to you, a slave is not greater than his [master]; nor a messenger greater than the one having sent him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The double Amen signals a foundational truth. The relationship is defined by sending (*pempsantos*). The *apostolos* (messenger/apostle) derives all dignity from the Sender. To claim superiority or exemption from service is to invert the cosmic order. The repetition *aut aut* at the end reinforces the focus on the Sender Himself.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ει ταυτα οιδατε μα εϲτε · εαν ποιητε αυτα

**English Translation**
If these things you know, blessed are you if you do them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Gnosis (knowledge) alone does not save; it condemns if not accompanied by praxis. The beatitude (*makarioi*) is contingent: "if you do them." Many know the theology of humility, but few possess the blessedness of the towel. The conditionality is sharp: knowledge is the foundation, but action is the completion.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ου πε παντων ϋμ λεγω · εγω γαρ οι τιναϲ εξελεξα · αλλ ϊνα η γρα πληρωθη · ο τρω μετ εμου τ αρτον · επηρκεν επ εμε την πτερ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Not concerning all of you do I speak; for I know whom I chose; but that the Scripture might be fulfilled: The [one] eating with me the bread lifted up against me his heel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The omniscience of the Son is declared: *Ego gar oida* ("For I know"). The betrayal is not a failure of the Master's judgment but a fulfillment of the *Graphē* (Psalm 41:9). The imagery is visceral: the *pterna* (heel) is the instrument of violence, raised by one who shares the intimate communion of the table (*trogōn*, chewing/eating). The proximity of the bread makes the treachery of the heel more heinous.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
απ αρ λεγω προ του γενεϲθαι ϊνα πιϲτευϲηται οτ γενηται · οτι εγω ει :

**English Translation**
From now I tell [you] before it happens, that you might believe when it happens that I am.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Prophecy functions here as a seal of divinity. He speaks *pro tou genesthai* (before it comes into being) so that the trauma of the betrayal does not shatter faith but confirms it. The object of belief is the absolute *Ego Eimi*—"I Am." Even in the face of treason, He remains the unchanging Lord.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω · ο λαμβαν αν τινα πεμψω . ε λαμβανει · ο δε εμε λαμβανων · λαμ τον πεμψαν με ·

**English Translation**
Amen amen I say: The [one] receiving whomever I send receives me; and the [one] receiving me, receives the [one] having sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chain of reception ascends to the Father. The text abbreviates the verbs (*lamban*, *lam*), hastening the connection between the sent one, the Son, and the Father. To welcome the humble servant (who washes feet) is to welcome the Incarnate Word, and to hold the Word is to touch the Unseen Father.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπων ετα τω π π και εμαρτυρηϲεν και ειπεν · αμην αμ λεγω ϋμιν οτι ειϲ εξ ϋμων παραδω με ·

**English Translation**
These things having said, [Jesus] was troubled in the spirit and testified and said: Amen amen I say to you that one of you will betray me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the true humanity of the Savior. He was troubled (*etarachthē*) in spirit. He does not face betrayal with stoic indifference but with holy anguish. The declaration is a legal testimony (*emartyrēsen*), a solemn truth delivered under the oath of "Amen, amen." The horror lies in the preposition: *ex hymōn*—"out of you." The danger is internal to the fold.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
εβλεπον ο ουν οι ϊουδαιοι ο ουν ο ο ειϲ αλληλουϲ οι μα απορουμε περι τινοϲ λε ·

**English Translation**
Looked therefore the Jews... [stutter] at one another, the disciples, being at a loss concerning whom he speaks.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here bears a strange witness. The text reads *hoi Ioudaioi* ("the Jews") where we expect "the disciples," followed by a correction or conflation *hoi ma[thētai]* ("the disciples"). It portrays a scene of profound confusion, mirrored in the scribe’s stuttering hand (*o oun o o*). The disciples are *aporoumenoi*—without passage, at a total loss. They cannot conceive that the traitor is among them.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ανακειμενοϲ ειϲ εκ των μαθη αυτου εν τω κολπω του · ον ηγαπα ο :

**English Translation**
Now there was reclining one of his disciples in the bosom of [Jesus], whom [Jesus] loved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the counter-image to the heel lifted in betrayal: the head resting in the *kolpos* (bosom). This specific term denotes the deepest intimacy, the same word used for the Son in the bosom of the Father (John 1:18). The Beloved Disciple represents the proximity of love, contrasting sharply with the proximity of treachery found in Judas.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
νευει ουν τουτω ϲ̣ι ϲιμων πετροϲ · πυ · τιϲ αν ειη περι ου ελεγεν · και λεγει αυτω · ειπε τιϲ εϲτιν περι ου λεγει ·

**English Translation**
Nods therefore to this one Simon Peter to inquire who it might be concerning whom he spoke; and he says to him: Say, who is it concerning whom he speaks?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, usually the first to speak, here acknowledges the unique position of the Beloved Disciple. He nods (*neuei*) and commands him to ask. The Sinaiticus text preserves a direct imperative: *Eipe tis estin* ("Say/Ask, who is it?"). Even the chief Apostle requires the mediation of love to penetrate the mystery of the Lord's sorrow.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
επιπεϲων αναπεϲων ουν εκεινοϲ επι το ϲτηθοϲ του · λεγει αυτω · · τιϲ εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
Having fallen upon, having leaned back, then, that one on the breast of the [Lord]; he says to him: [Lord], who is it?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the double motion recorded by the scribe, *epipesōn anapesōn*—falling upon and leaning back. The Beloved Disciple does not merely recline; he collapses in intimacy upon the breast of the Word. It is a movement of sudden grief mixed with confidence. He falls upon the source of Life to ask of death. The text leaves the name of the Master as a sacred pause (`του ·`), for the breast of Jesus is the Holy of Holies, where names vanish into presence. He asks "Who is it?" not out of curiosity, but out of the terror that love might be betrayed by one of its own.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
αποκρινε ουν ο και λεγει . ε εϲτιν · ὡ ε βαψαϲ το ψωμι επιδωϲω · βα ουν το ψωμι ψωμιον λαμβανι κ(αι) ψωμι διδωϲιν ϊουδα ϲιμωνοϲ ϊϲκαρι ·

**English Translation**
Answers then the [Jesus] and says: [He] it is, to whom I, having dipped the bread, shall give it; [having] dipped then the bread-morsel, he takes and bread he gives to Judas of Simon Iscariot.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers with the weight of the moment: *psōmi psōmion* (bread, morsel). The hand of the Lord dips into the dish, a gesture of friendship weaponized by the recipient's heart. Note the specific designation: Judas of Simon Iscariot. The lineage is marked. The giving of the bread is the final appeal of Grace; to receive the bread from God's hand while harboring betrayal is to consume judgment. The scribe’s repetition of "bread" emphasizes the substance—this is not mere food, but the vehicle of revelation and separation.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και μετα το ψωμιον ειϲηλθ ειϲ εκεινον ο ϲα · λεγει ουν αυ ο ο ποιειϲ · ποι ταχειον ·

**English Translation**
And after the morsel, entered into that one the Sa[tan]; says then to him the [Jesus]: What you do, do quickly.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the terrible transubstantiation of evil. As the morsel enters the body, the Adversary (`ο ϲα`, the Satan) enters the soul. The altar of the heart is ceded to the enemy. The Lord’s command, "What you do, do quickly," is not a permission of sin, but a sovereign dismissal. He commands the timing of His own passion. He does not suffer the betrayal passively; He orders the traitor to proceed, transforming the act of malice into the act of redemption. The King commands the executioner to prepare the throne.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
του δε ουδειϲ εγνω των ανακειμεν · προϲ τι ειπεν αυ ·

**English Translation**
But this no one knew of the reclining [ones], for what he said to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The mystery of iniquity is hidden from the faithful. The disciples, resting in the innocence of their devotion, cannot comprehend the depth of the chasm opening in their midst. They hear the words but miss the judgment. It is a mercy of God that we do not always see the evil in our brother's heart, lest we cease to love him before the end. The "reclining ones" are at rest, while the son of perdition stands on the precipice.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
τινεϲ γαρ εδο · επι το γλωϲ ειχεν ϊουδαϲ · οτι λεγει αυτω · αγοραϲ αγοραϲ · ων χριαν εχομεν ειϲ την εορτην · η τοιϲ πτωχοιϲ ϊνα τι δω ·

**English Translation**
For some thought, since the [bag] Judas had, that he says to him: Buy, buy [what things] need we have for the feast; or to the poor that something he might give.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The repetition *agoras agoras* ("buy, buy") in the manuscript reflects the urgency the disciples imagined. They interpret the spiritual crisis through the lens of mundane duty—provision for the feast or alms for the poor. They see Judas as the treasurer (`γλωϲ`, the tongue-box/bag holder), not the traitor. How often does the Church mistake the machinations of wolves for the administration of charity? They looked for bread for the feast, unaware that the True Bread was about to be broken for the life of the world.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
λαβων ουν το ψωμιον εκεινοϲ εξηλθεν ευθυϲ · ην δε νυξʼ ·

**English Translation**
Having taken then the morsel, that one went out immediately; and it was night.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The brevity of the scribe is thunderous: *ēn de nyx* (and it was night). Judas leaves the Light of the World and steps into the elemental darkness. It is not merely the time of day; it is the spiritual condition of the soul without Christ. He takes the morsel—the material blessing—but rejects the Blesser, and thus he inherits the night. Outside the upper room of communion, there is only the dark.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
οτε ουν ε · λεγει ν ν εδοξαϲθη ο του ανου α · και ο εδο εν αυτω

**English Translation**
When then [he went out], says [Jesus]: Now, now was glorified the [Son] of [Man]; and [God] was glorified in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
With the departure of the traitor, the air clears for glory. The text reads `ν ν`—a stuttering "Now, now!" or perhaps "Now [is] the Son." The urgency is absolute. The glorification of the Son of Man (`ανου`, of Man) begins not with the Resurrection, but here, at the acceptance of the Cross. The departure of Judas triggers the machinery of glory. God is glorified in the Son's obedience unto death. The abbreviation `α` stands starkly for the Son/Man, the Alpha of the new creation, revealed in the passion.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ει ο εδοξαϲθη εν αυτω και ο δοξαϲει αυτον εν αυτω εαυτω αυτω · και ευθυϲ δοξαϲει αυτον

**English Translation**
If [God] was glorified in him, also [God] will glorify him in [Himself/him]; and immediately he will glorify him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text circles upon itself in a divine spiral of glory: `εν αυτω εαυτω αυτω`. The mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son is exposed. If the Son glorifies the Father by the Cross, the Father glorifies the Son by the Resurrection—and He does it "in Himself." The distinction of persons remains, yet the unity of essence is absolute. "Immediately" (`ευθυϲ`) marks the inseparable link between the suffering and the exaltation. There is no delay in the divine estimation; the Cross is the Glory.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
τεκνια ετι μεικρ χρονον μεθ ϋμ ειμι · ζητηϲεται με · και καθωϲ ειπ ειπ τοιϲ · ο οτι οπου εγω ϋμειϲ ου δυναϲθαι ελθιν · και λε αρτι ·

**English Translation**
Little children, yet a little time with you I am; you will seek me; and as I said, said to the [Jews]: That where I [go] you are not able to come; also [to you] I say now.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He calls them *teknia*—little children. The tone shifts from the high theology of glory to the tender solicitude of a dying father. The repetition `ειπ ειπ` ("said, said") underscores the immutability of His decree. He had told the unbelieving Jews they could not follow; now He tells His beloved children the same. But the meaning has changed. For the Jews, it was a barrier of judgment; for the children, it is a temporary veil. He goes to prepare a place where they cannot yet tread, for the flesh cannot inherit the Kingdom until it is washed by the blood He is about to shed.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
εντολην καινην διδωμι · αγαπατε αλληλουϲ καθωϲ ηγαπηϲα · και αγαπα αλληλουϲ ·

**English Translation**
A new commandment I give: Love one another as I loved [you]; and [that you] love one another.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Why "new"? The law commanded love of neighbor. But here the standard is elevated from "as yourself" to "as I loved you." This is the impossible standard of the Cross—self-emptying, sacrificial love. The scribe adds `και αγαπα αλληλουϲ` at the end, a persistent echo: "and love one another." It is as if the command must be repeated to be heard over the clamor of our selfishness. This is the badge of the new Israel, the liturgy of the heart.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
εν του γνωϲονται παντεϲ · οτι εμοι μαθηται εϲτε · εαν αγαπην εχη μετ αλληλ :

**English Translation**
In this will know all that my disciples you are, if love you have among one another.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The apologetic of the Church is not in eloquence or miracle, but in the `αγαπην` (love) held `μετ αλληλ` (among one another). The world knows the disciples not by their vestments but by their unity. If the bond is broken, the witness is shattered. The text uses `εμοι` (my/to me)—disciples *to me*. We belong to Him only insofar as we belong to one another in love.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ϲιμ ϲιμ πετροϲ · · που ϋ · απεκριθη αυτω ο · οπου ε · ου δυ μοι νυν α · ακο δε ϋϲτε ·

**English Translation**
Says to him Sim[on] Sim[on] Peter: [Lord], where goest thou? Answered him the [Jesus]: Where [I go] not able [thou art] me now to follow; but thou shalt follow later.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript cries out `ϲιμ ϲιμ`—Simon, Simon! The old name is doubled, recalling his natural weakness before his spiritual rock-nature. Peter ignores the command to love and fixates on the departure: "Where goest thou?" He trusts in his own strength to follow (`ακο` - *akolouthēsai*). The Lord’s reply is a merciful check: "Not able thou art now." The "now" is crucial. Peter must first fail, be broken, and be restored before he can follow the Lord to the cross of martyrdom. He will follow "later" (`ϋϲτε`), when the Spirit has replaced his fleshly bravado with divine power.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω πετροϲ διατι ου δυναμε ϲοι ακο αρτι · ϋ ϲου την ψυχ ψυχ μου θηϲω ·

**English Translation**
Peter says to Him, "Why am I not able to [follow] You just now? On behalf of You, the life—life of me—I will lay down."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, beloved, the fervor of the disciple which outstrips his capacity. The text here presents Peter in a state of agitated urgency. He asks, `διατι ου δυναμε` ("Why am I not able?"), the phonetic spelling `δυναμε` betraying the common speech, yet the question strikes at the heart of human limitation against divine timing. The scribe abbreviates the act of following (`ακο` for *akolouthēsai*), as if Peter’s desire to follow is cut short even in the writing, just as it will be in reality.

Most striking is the pledge: `ϋ ϲου` (on Your behalf). The manuscript contains a repetition, `την ψυχ ψυχ μου` ("the life life of me"). Whether this be a slip of the copyist’s hand or a divine emphasis preserved in ink, it speaks to us of Peter’s total, albeit fragile, commitment. He offers his "life" twice over in word, yet he does not yet understand that the One he speaks to is the only One who can truly lay down a life effectively. Peter claims the role of the benefactor (`θηϲω`, I will lay down), usurping the place of the Christ who alone is the Good Shepherd.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
αποκρινεται · τ τ ψυχην ϲου ε θηϲειϲ · αμ αμην λεγω ϲοι · ου μη αλεκτωρ φω · εωϲ ου απαρ με τριϲ τρειϲ :

**English Translation**
He answers: "[The] [The] life of yours [for me] will you lay down? Amen, amen I say to you: by no means will a rooster [crow] until you [deny] Me thrice—three times."

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Lord dismantles the presumption of the servant. The text begins with `αποκρινεται` (He answers), but the subject is obscured in the abbreviated or stuttered `τ τ`, perhaps a fragmented reference to the Lord or the article `την` repeated, mirroring Peter's earlier stutter. The question is piercing: "The life of yours will you lay down?" The particle `ε` stands as a remnant of the prepositional phrase "for me" (*hyper emou*), reduced here to a mere breath, suggesting how little Peter’s sacrifice truly weighs in the economy of salvation at this moment.

The solemnity is absolute in the double affirmation `αμ αμην` (Amen, amen). The warning that follows is starkly abbreviated in our codex: `φω` for the voice of the rooster, and `απαρ` for the act of denial. It is as if the text cannot bear to write the full shame of the apostle. The final phrase `τριϲ τρειϲ` ("thrice three times") combines the adverb and the numeral, a heavy, redundant sealing of the prophecy. The Lord sees the threefold denial clearly, even if the scribe struggles to pen the horror of it. Peter’s confidence is flesh; the rooster’s cry will be the judgment of reality upon that flesh.
