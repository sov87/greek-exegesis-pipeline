**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) μετα ταυτα περι ο εν τη γαλιλαια · ου γαρ η εν τη ϊου περιπατειν · οτι εζητουν αυ οι ϊουδαιοι αποκτιναι :

**English Translation**
And after these things [He] walked in Galilee; for He did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the prudence of the Incarnate Word. He who holds the power of life and death does not recklessly expose Himself to danger before the appointed hour. The text reads *peri[epatei] o* (He walked), showing His continuous movement among the humble Galileans. He avoids Judea, not from cowardice, but because the "Jews"—by which the Evangelist designates the hostile authorities of the temple—had already conceived the intent of murder (*apoktinai*). Thus, the Lord teaches us to navigate the wickedness of the world with wisdom, awaiting the divine *kairos*.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ην δε εγγυϲ η εορ των ϊουδαι η ϲκηνοπηγια ·

**English Translation**
Now the feast of the Jews was near, the Tabernacles.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *Scenopegia* (Tabernacles) is at hand. Mark the typology: the Jews dwell in booths to remember their sojourn in the wilderness, yet here stands the True Tabernacle, the Flesh of Christ, preparing to manifest Himself. The Codex specifies it is the feast "of the Jews," distancing the church from the shadow of the law, for the reality has come in the person of the Savior.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ουν οι α αυτου προϲ αυτον ˙ μεταβηθι εντευθεν · και ϋ ειϲ την ϊου · ϊνα και οι μαθηται ϲου θε θεωρηϲουϲιν τα εργα ϲου α ποιειϲ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore His brothers said to Him: Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The brethren (*adelphoi*) speak from a carnal understanding. They urge Him to *hupage* (go) into the center of power, Judea. Their motivation is spectacle; they wish for the works to be "beheld" (*theoresousin*) with the eyes of flesh, confusing the spiritual Kingdom with worldly fame. Note the scribal hesitation in the Codex (`θε θεωρηϲουϲιν`), as if the hand trembled at this demand for vain display.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
ουδιϲ γαρ τι εν κρυπτω ποιων ζητι αυτοϲ εν παρρηϲια ειναι · ει ταυτα ποιειϲ φανερωϲον ϲε τω κοϲμω ·

**English Translation**
For no one does anything in secret and seeks himself to be in openness; if You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the logic of the world: *parrhesia* (boldness/publicity) is the goal of action. They taunt the Lord: "If You do these things..." casting doubt upon His miracles unless they are ratified by the applause of the cosmos. They demand He manifest Himself to the "world," not knowing that the World is darkness and cannot comprehend the Light unless the Father draws it.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
ουδε γαρ οι αδελ αυτου επιϲτευ ειϲ αυτον ˙

**English Translation**
For neither did His brothers believe in Him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A verse of profound sorrow. Those bound to Him by blood (kinship) were severed from Him by unbelief. The Codex uses the imperfect *episteuon*, suggesting a persistent state of unbelief. Proximity to the Holy One does not guarantee sanctity; only faith bridges the gap between the clay and the Potter.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ουν αυτοιϲ ο ο καιροϲ ο εμοϲ ου ουπω παρεϲτιν · ο δε και ο ϋμετεροϲ · παντοτε εϲτιν ε ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [Jesus] says to them: My time is not yet present; but your time is always ready.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord distinguishes between His *kairos*—the divinely appointed moment of the Passion and glorification—and their time. For the worldly, any time is suitable for their pursuits because they swim with the current of the age. But for the Holy One, the hour is fixed by the Father. The Codex reads `ου ουπω` (not not yet), a double negation emphasizing the absolute unreadiness of the moment for His public revelation as a political Messiah.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
ο κοϲμοϲ ου δυνα ου δυναται ο κοϲμοϲ μιϲειν ϋμαϲ · εμε δε μιϲει οτι μαρτυρω · οτι τα εργα αυτου πονη εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
The world cannot—the world cannot hate you; but it hates Me, because I testify concerning it that its works are evil.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats `ου δυναται` (cannot), inadvertently underscoring the impossibility. The world cannot hate those who belong to it; like loves like. But Christ is the stumbling block. He is hated not for His works of power, but for His testimony (*martyro*) that the deeds of the world are *ponera* (evil). Truth is the generator of hatred in a heart committed to darkness.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ α ειϲ την εορτην ταυτην ταυτην ˙ εγω ουκ αναβαι ειϲ την εορ ταυτην · οτι ο εμοϲ καιροϲ ου πεπληρωται ˙

**English Translation**
You go up to this feast; I do not go up to this feast, because My time has not been fulfilled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Attend closely, for the enemies of the Faith, like Porphyry, attack this text. The Codex Sinaiticus reads `ουκ` (not) rather than *oupo* (not yet). Does the Lord lie? God forbid. He says "I do not go up" in the manner *you* propose—with public fanfare to seize the kingdom. He refuses the carnal ascent. His time to be lifted up (on the Cross) is not fulfilled. He denies the *method* of the ascent, not the journey itself.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα ειπων · αυ εμινεν εν τη γαλιλαια ·

**English Translation**
Saying these things, He remained in Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He remains (*emeinen*). The Lord is immovable by peer pressure or the taunts of kin. He abides in Galilee, the "Circle of the Gentiles," waiting for the precise moment commanded by the Father. Patience is the virtue of the Omnipotent.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ δε α οι αδελ αυτου ειϲ την εορτην · τοτε και αυτοϲ ανεβη · ου φανερωϲ · αλλ εν κρυπτω ˙

**English Translation**
But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He also went up, not openly, but in secret.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the apparent contradiction is resolved. He went up, but `εν κρυπτω` (in secret). He did not go up as the wonder-worker seeking glory (which He denied in verse 8), but as the Teacher seeking the lost. He ascends to the feast to sanctify it, yet veils His majesty, for the time of open glory is reserved for the Resurrection.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
οι ουν ϊουδαιοι εζητουν αυτον εν τη εορ · και ελεγον που εϲτιν εκινοϲ ˙

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews were seeking Him at the feast and were saying: Where is that one?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The malice of the search is evident. They do not name Him. They say `εκινοϲ` ("that one"), a pronoun of distance and disdain. They seek Him in the crowd, but they cannot find Him because they do not seek Him in the Spirit. They look for a man to kill, while the Life stands in their midst.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
και γογγυϲμοϲ πο ην περι αυτου εν τω οχλω · οι μ ελεγον · οτι αγαθοϲ εϲτιν · αλλοι ελεγ · ου · αλλα πλανα τ τ οχλον ·

**English Translation**
And there was much murmuring concerning Him in the crowd; some indeed were saying that He is good; others were saying: No, but He leads the crowd astray.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of Christ brings division (*schisma*). There is `γογγυϲμοϲ` (murmuring), the same word used of the rebellious Israelites in the desert. The crowd is split: some sense His goodness (`αγαθοϲ`), while others accuse Him of deception (`πλανα`). This is the eternal verdict of the world upon the Church: we are either saints or seducers, for the Truth cannot be ignored, only loved or reviled.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ουδιϲ μεν παρρηϲια περι αυτου ελαλει δια τον φοβον των ϊουδαιων ·

**English Translation**
No one, indeed, spoke openly concerning him because of the fear of the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the tyranny of terror. The text uses the word *parrhesia*—that boldness of speech which belongs to the free—yet here it is stifled. The Truth is present in their midst, yet the "fear of the Jews" acts as a gag upon the mouth of the people. It is a spiritual sickness when the fear of men outweighs the reverence due to the Word. They whisper the truth in shadows, proving that without the grace of the Spirit, the human heart is a slave to social dread.

**Verse 14**


**Greek Text**
ηδη δε τηϲ ερτηϲ εορτηϲ με · ανεβη ειϲ το ϊερον και ε

**English Translation**
But now [at] the middle of the fe[ast]—feast—[he] went up into the temple and [taught]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe here stumbles, writing *ertēs* and correcting to *eortēs*, betraying the human hand preserving the divine record. The Lord goes up (*anebē*) into the *hieron*, the sacred precinct. Note the timing: the "middle." He does not seek the fanfare of the beginning nor the finality of the end, but interjects Himself into the center of their ritual. The verse cuts off abruptly at "and e..." (likely *edidasken*, "taught"), reminding us that the Lord’s action often exceeds our capacity to record it fully. He ascends to the holy place, and the silence that follows in this manuscript invites us to listen all the more closely.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
εθαυμαζον ουν οι ϊουδαιοι λεγον · πωϲ ουτοϲ γραμματα οιδεν · μη μεμαθηκωϲ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews marveled, saying: How does this one know letters, not having learned?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the paradox of the Incarnation. The Jews marvel at His knowledge of *grammata* (scriptures/letters), knowing He lacks human schooling. They look for the teacher, but fail to see the Source. He who is the Wisdom of the Father needs no tutor; the Author of the Law needs no scribe to explain the text. Their marveling is not faith, but confusion, for they judge wisdom by the pedigree of the school rather than the power of the utterance.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ουν αυ και ειπεν · η εμη διδαχη ου εϲτιν εμη · αλλα του πεμψαντοϲ με ˙

**English Translation**
Therefore [he] answered th[em] and said: My teaching is not mine, but of the one who sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Son claims no possession of the doctrine separate from the Father. "My teaching is not mine" destroys the notion of Christ as a mere philosopher inventing novelties. It is a revelation of the divine economy: the Son is the Voice, the Father is the Speaker. By saying it is "of the one who sent me," He establishes His authority not on earthly credentials (which they questioned in verse 15), but on celestial mission.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
εαν τιϲ θελη το θελημα αυτου ποιειν · γνωϲε περι τηϲ διδα ποτερον εκ εϲτιν · η εγω α εμαυτου λαλω ·

**English Translation**
If anyone wills to do his will, he will know concerning the teach[ing], whether it is from [God], or I speak from myself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark this epistemological key: Understanding follows obedience. The scribe abbreviates *didachēs* to *dida*, yet the meaning stands firm. One does not judge the divine teaching through intellect alone, but through the will (*thelē*). If you wish to know if the doctrine is *ek* (from) the Divine, you must first attempt to perform the Divine Will. Purity of life is the prerequisite for clarity of doctrine.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ο αφ εαυτου λαλ την δοξαν την ︴ ζητι · και ο ζητων την δοξ του πεμψαντοϲ αυ · ουτοϲ αληθηϲ εϲτιν · και αδικια εν αυτω ουκ εϲτ ·

**English Translation**
He who speaks from himself seeks [his own] glory; and he who seeks the glor[y] of the one who sent hi[m], this one is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe uses a mark (︴) to indicate the reflexive "own" (*idian*), perhaps to save space or due to a defect in the exemplar. The contrast is absolute: Self-speech leads to self-glory (*doxan*). Christ, however, is the *Alēthēs* (the True One) because He is entirely referential to the Sender. The absence of *adikia* (unrighteousness) is linked to the absence of self-seeking. Where there is no ego, there is no sin.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ου μω δεδω τον νο · και ουδιϲ ε ϋμων ποιει τον νομον · τι με ζη αποκτιναι ·

**English Translation**
Did not Mo[ses] give the La[w]? And no one of you does the law. Why do you se[ek] to kill me?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord exposes their hypocrisy with a piercing question. The text abbreviates Moses (*Mō*) and Law (*No*), rushing to the accusation. They claim to be guardians of the Mosaic Law, yet they violate its core by harboring murderous intent. "Why do you seek (*zē* for *zēteite*) to kill me?" He unveils the hidden thought of the heart. To kill the Lawgiver in the name of the Law is the ultimate absurdity of sin.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο οχλοϲ · δαιμονιον εχειϲ · τιϲ ϲε ζητι απο :

**English Translation**
The crowd answered: You have a demon; who seeks to ki[ll] you?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The crowd, blind to the machinations of their own rulers, resorts to slander. "You have a demon" (*daimonion echeis*)—they accuse the Light of being darkness. They deny the reality of the threat ("Who seeks to kill you?"), proving that the mob is often ignorant of the very evils committed in its name. The abrupt end of the verse at *apo* (for *apokteinai*) mirrors the abruptness of their dismissal.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ει αυτοιϲ · ἑν ερ εποιηϲα · και παντεϲ θαυμαζε

**English Translation**
[He] answered and sai[d] to them: One wor[k] I did, and you all marvel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "One Work" (*hen ergon*) refers to the healing of the paralytic on the Sabbath (John 5). The Lord contrasts the singularity of His act of mercy with the plurality of their astonishment (*thaumaze*). They are scandalized by one good deed performed on a holy day, showing that their capacity for marvel is directed at the breaking of their customs, not the manifestation of God's power.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ο δια τουτο μω δε την περιτομην · ουχ ο εκ του μωϲεωϲ εϲτιν · αλλ οτι εκ των πατερων · και εν ϲαββατω περι ανθρω :

**English Translation**
Therefore Mo[ses] ga[ve] the circumcision—not th[at] it is of Moses, but that [it is] of the fathers—and on a Sabbath you circum[cise] a ma[n].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A dense theological argument. Moses (*Mō*) gave the law of circumcision, yet the rite predates him, coming from the "fathers" (Patriarchs). The Lord argues from the hierarchy of obligation: If the law of circumcision (which inflicts a wound) supersedes the Sabbath rest, how much more does the law of mercy? They circumcise a man (*peri anthrō*) on the Sabbath to perfect him ritually; Christ heals to perfect him actually.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ει περιτομην λαμ ανθρωποϲ εν ϲαββατω · ϊνα μη · λυθη ο νομοϲ ο μω · εμοι χολαται · οτι ολον ανθρωπον εποιηϲα εν ϲαβ ·

**English Translation**
If a man rec[eives] circumcision on a Sabbath so that the law of Mo[ses] may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole man [well] on a Sab[bath]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The argument *a fortiori*. If the "Law of Moses" (*nomos Mō*) permits cutting the flesh to keep the covenant, why does it forbid restoring the "whole man" (*holon anthrōpon*)? The scribe's *cholatai* (are you angry/bitter) highlights the emotional irrationality of their legalism. They value the ritual cut more than the restored life. They protect the shadow of the law while fighting the Substance who gives life.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
μη κρινετε κατ οψιν · αλλα την δικαιαν κριϲιν κρινατε ·

**English Translation**
Do not judge according to appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final admonition of this section. *Kat' opsin* (according to the face/appearance) is the method of the hypocrite who sees only the external Sabbath violation. *Dikaian krisin* (righteous judgment) looks at the intent and the fruit—mercy and wholeness. We must not be superficial readers of the Law, nor superficial judges of our brethren. True judgment aligns with the heart of God, which seeks restoration, not merely restriction.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ελεγον ουν τινεϲ των ϊ · ουκ ουτοϲ εϲτιν · ον ζητουϲιν α ·

**English Translation**
They said therefore some of the J[erusalemites]: Is this not [he] whom they seek to k[ill]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal contraction `των ϊ` for the inhabitants of the Holy City, and the chilling abbreviation `α` for *apokteinai* (to kill). The text compresses the violence of the intent into a single letter, just as the hearts of the rulers are compressed by malice. The crowd, the "some," recognize the victim but not the Victor. They see the man marked for death, yet fail to see the Life standing before them.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και ϊ παρρηϲια λαλι · και ουδεν αυτω λεγουϲιν · μη τι α εγνωϲαν οι αρχϊερειϲ · οτι ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο ·

**English Translation**
And b[ehold] boldly he speaks, and nothing to him do they say. Did the chief priests t[ruly] know that this is the [Christ]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text reads `και ϊ`, an imperative "behold" or "see," calling attention to the Lord's boldness (`παρρηϲια`). Note the abrupt ending `οτι ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο` (that this is the...). The title *Christos* is suspended, represented only by the article `ο`. It is as if the scribe, or indeed the rulers themselves, hesitate to fully articulate the title, leaving the confession hanging in the air, known yet unspoken.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
αλλα τουτον οι ποθεν ε · ο οταν ελ μη πλιονα ϲη ποιηϲει · η ο δε οταν ερχεται μη πλιονα ϲημια ποιηϲει · η ο ο ο ερχεται ουδιϲ γινωϲκει αυτον ποθεν εϲτιν :

**English Translation**
But this one we [know] whence he is; the [Christ] when he c[omes] will he not do more s[igns]? or the [Christ] when he comes will he not do more signs? or the [Christ]... he who comes, no one knows him whence he is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we witness a great turbulence in the text, mirroring the turbulence of the crowd's mind. The scribe writes, then repeats `ο οταν ελ` and the question of signs (`ϲημια`), conflating the doubt of origin with the demand for miracles. This textual confusion—repeating the query "will he do more signs?" twice—exposes the frantic, circular reasoning of unbelief. They oscillate between claiming to know his origin (`ποθεν ε`) and the theological expectation that the Messiah's origin is unknown (`ουδιϲ γινωϲκει`).

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
εκραξεν ουν ο εν τω διδα και λεγων · και εμε οιδατε και οιδατε ποθ ειμι · και απ εμαυ ουκ εληλυθα αλλα εϲτιν αληθηϲ ο πεμψαϲ με · ον ϋμειϲ ουκ οιδα ˙

**English Translation**
Cried out therefore the [Jesus] in the teach[ing] and saying: You both know me and you know whence I am; and of m[yself] I have not come, but he is true who sent me, whom you do not k[now].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord `εκραξεν` (cried out), a verb of intense prophetic proclamation. The text abbreviates `διδα` (teaching) and `απ εμαυ` (of myself). Jesus grants them their carnal knowledge ("you know my earthly kin") but denies them spiritual insight. He distinguishes his physical procession, which is visible, from his eternal generation from the Father, the `πεμψαϲ με` (the One having sent me), whom the abbreviated text notes they `ουκ οιδα` (do not know).

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
εγω δε οιδα αυτον οτι παρ αυ αυτου ειμι · κακεινοϲ με απεϲταλκεν ·

**English Translation**
But I know him, because from h[im] him I am, and that one sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound scribal stutter appears here: `παρ αυ αυτου` (from him, him). Whether an error of the hand or a divine emphasis, it underscores the immediacy of the Son's origin. He is not merely *from* the Father; He is of the very substance of the Father. The repetition serves the theology: the origin is singular, emphatic, and absolute.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
οι δε εζητουν αυ πιαϲαι · και ου επεβαλεν επ αυτον την χει · οτι ουπω ελη η ωρα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And they sought to seize h[im]; and [no one] laid upon him the h[and], because not yet had c[ome] his hour.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The intent to seize (`πιαϲαι`) is thwarted not by force, but by the divine chronometer. The text abbreviates `χει` (hand) and `ελη` (had come). The "hour" (`ωρα`) controls the passion, not the will of the mob. The truncation of "hand" visually demonstrates their inability to complete the action; the hand is shortened, unable to grasp the Lord.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
πολλοι δε επιϲτευ εκ του οχλου ειϲ αυτον · και ελε ο οταν ελ μη πλιονα ϲη ποιηϲει ουτοϲ ποιει εποιηϲεν ·

**English Translation**
But many believed from the crowd into him; and said: The [Christ] when he c[omes], will he not do more s[igns] [than] this one does did?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text presents a curious reading: `ποιει εποιηϲεν` (does did). It juxtaposes the present tense and the aorist. The crowd asks: Will the coming Christ do more signs than this man *is doing* and *has done*? The scribal conflation captures the totality of Christ's ministry—the miracles are both a present spectacle and a completed history of power.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ηκου κουϲαν ηκουϲαν δε οι φαριϲαι του οχλου γογ ταυτα περι αυτου · και α τουϲ ϋ οι αρχϊ και οι φαρι ϊνα πιαϲω αυτον :

**English Translation**
Heard heard heard the Pharisees the crowd m[urmuring] these things concerning him; and s[ent] the officers the c[hief priests] and the Phar[isees] in order that they might seize him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the agitation in the text! `ηκου κουϲαν ηκουϲαν`—a triple repetition of "heard." The scribe stammers, reflecting the overwhelming noise of the `γογ` (murmuring) that assaulted the ears of the Pharisees. Panic drives the syntax. They send `τουϲ ϋ` (the officers), abbreviated as mere instruments of the hierarchy, to silence the Word.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν ουν ο ετι χρονον μικρον μεθ υμων ειμι · και ϋπαγω προϲ τον πεμψαντα με ·

**English Translation**
Said therefore the [Jesus]: Yet a little time with you I am, and I go to the One having sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The subject `ο` (The [Jesus]) is implied by the article alone. The Lord announces his departure (`ϋπαγω`). The brevity of the text matches the brevity of the time remaining (`χρονον μικρον`). He does not flee to a hiding place, but returns to the Source, `τον πεμψαντα με`.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ζητηϲετε με και ουχ ευρηϲετε · και οπου ειμι εγω ϋ ου δυναϲθαι ελθιν ·

**English Translation**
You will seek me and will not find; and where I am, y[ou] are not able to come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A severe judgment. The `ϋ` (you) stands in opposition to `εγω` (I). The phonetic spelling `δυναϲθαι` (for *dynasthe*) reflects the spoken reality of the warning. There is a place—the bosom of the Father—where the malice of the `ϋ` (the unbelieving Jews) cannot penetrate. Their seeking will be in vain because it is a seeking of the body, not the Spirit.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ουν οι ϊουδαιοι προϲ εαυτουϲ που ου μελλει πορευ · οτι ουχ ευρη αυτον · μη ειϲ την διαϲπορ των ελληνων μελλει πορευε και διδαϲκιν τουϲ ελληναϲ ·

**English Translation**
Said therefore the Jews to themselves: Where is t[his one] about to g[o], that we shall not f[ind] him? Is he about to go to the disper[sion] of the Greeks and teach the Greeks?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Jews mockingly prophesy the Gentile mission. They ask if he will go to the `διαϲπορ` (dispersion). The text abbreviates `πορευ` (go) and `ευρη` (find). They think in terms of geography; He speaks of theology. They imagine a journey to the Greeks (`ελληνων`); He intends a journey to the Father. Yet, in their irony, they speak the truth: He will indeed teach the Greeks through His Church.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
τι εϲτιν ουτοϲ ο λογοϲ · ον ειπε ειπεν · ζη με και ου ευρηϲετε · και ο ειμι εγω ϋμιϲ ου δυναϲθαι ελθ ελθ ·

**English Translation**
What is this the word which he said said: S[eek] me and you will not find? and w[here] I am, you are not able to c[ome] c[ome]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter concludes with confusion and repetition. `ειπε ειπεν` (said said) and `ελθ ελθ` (come come) mark the text. The Jews turn the riddle over in their mouths, repeating the words but missing the Word. They are fixated on the `ζη` (seeking) and the inability to `ελθ` (come), trapped in a loop of literalism while the Divine Logos prepares to ascend beyond their grasp.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
εν δε τη εϲχατη η τη μεγαλη τηϲ εορτηϲ · ϊϲτη ο και εκρα λεγων ˙ εαν τιϲ διψα ερχεϲθω προϲ με και πινετω ·

**English Translation**
And in the last, the great [day] of the feast, stood [Jesus] and cried out saying: If anyone thirsts let him come to me and drink.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the solemnity of the timing; it is the culmination, the "last and great" day, signifying the fulfillment of the Law's shadows. The scribe abbreviates the Lord's presence (`ϊϲτη ο`), yet His action is undeniable: He stands and cries out. This cry is the proclamation of the Gospel to a parched humanity. He does not whisper to a few but invites "anyone" (`τιϲ`) who thirsts. The condition for salvation is not wealth or lineage, but thirst—a recognition of one's own spiritual aridity. He offers Himself as the fountain, fulfilling the prophecy of the rock in the wilderness.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
ο πι ειϲ εμε καθωϲ ειπεν η γραφη ˙ ποταμοι ‾‾ εκ τηϲ κοιλιαϲ αυ ρευϲουϲιν ϋδα ζωντοϲ ·

**English Translation**
The [one] believing in me, just as the scripture said: rivers — out of his belly shall flow of living water.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the mystery of participation in the Divine life. The believer (`ο πι`) does not merely consume the water; he becomes a conduit of it. The scribe marks a pause (`ποταμοι ‾‾`), emphasizing the magnitude of the promise: "Rivers!" Not a trickle, but an abundance. The "belly" (`κοιλιαϲ`) signifies the innermost depth of the heart. By believing in the Christ, the barren soul is transformed into a paradise, watering the earth with the Spirit's grace, as foretold by the prophets Isaiah and Zechariah.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
τουτο δε ελεγεν περι του π · ὁυ ημελλον λαμβανιν οι πι ειϲ αυ · ουπω γαρ ην π π · οτι ουπω δεδοξαϲτο εδοξαϲθη ·

**English Translation**
But this he said concerning the Spirit, of which were about to receive those believing in him; for [the] Spirit was not yet, because [Jesus] was not yet glorified [had been glorified].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist provides the interpretation: the water is the Spirit (`π`, *Pneuma*). We see a textual struggle in the manuscript (`δεδοξαϲτο εδοξαϲθη`), a stutter between "had been glorified" and "was glorified." This reflects the tension of the timeline. The Spirit’s full outpouring awaits the Son’s glorification—which is, paradoxically, His crucifixion and resurrection. The Spirit was always existent as God, yet "was not yet" given to men as an indwelling presence until the flesh of the Word had conquered death.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
εκ του οχλου ουν ακουϲ αυτου των λο τουτων ελεγ αληθωϲ ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο προφητηϲ ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [some] from the crowd, having heard him [speak] of these words, were saying: Truly this is the Prophet.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The power of the Word (`των λο`) pierces the confusion of the multitude. Upon hearing, they confess Him as "The Prophet"—the one promised to Moses in Deuteronomy. Note that they do not yet call Him God, but they recognize a voice that speaks with the authority of heaven. Faith begins with hearing; the ear receives the seed of the Logos, and the tongue begins to confess the truth, even if imperfectly.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
αλλοι ελεγον · ου εϲτιν ο ˙ αλ ελεγον μη γαρ εκ τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ ο ερχεται ˙

**English Translation**
Others were saying: This is the [Christ]. But others were saying: For does the Christ come out of Galilee?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here arises the stumbling block of the flesh. Some rightly identify Him (`ου εϲτιν ο`—This is the [Christ]), yet others are blinded by geography. They ask, "Does the Christ come out of Galilee?" Their knowledge of the letter of the Law blinds them to the Spirit of the Law. They judge by earthly origins, ignorant of the heavenly descent and the true birth in Bethlehem. It is a warning to us: do not let intellectual pride obscure the presence of God when He appears in humble guise.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
ουχι η γραφη ειπεν ο εκ του ϲπερμα δ δ · και απο βηθλεεμ τηϲ κω οπου ην ο δ · ο ερχεται ·

**English Translation**
Did not the scripture say that out of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the village where David was, the Christ comes?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The tragic irony of the learned! They quote the Scriptures accurately regarding the "seed of David" (`ϲπερμα δ δ`) and the village of Bethlehem (`βηθλεεμ τηϲ κω`), yet they use this truth to deny the Truth standing before them. They possess the map but refuse to follow the Guide. They know where the Messiah *should* be born, but fail to inquire where Jesus *was* born. Presumption is the enemy of revelation.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
ϲχιϲμα ουν εγε εν τω οχλω δι αυτον ·

**English Translation**
Therefore a schism occurred in the crowd because of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The presence of Christ brings a "schism" (`ϲχιϲμα`). He is the cornerstone to some and a rock of offense to others. Truth, by its nature, separates light from darkness. The crowd is no longer a unified mass; they are divided by their response to the Word. Unity cannot be preserved at the expense of Truth; even among the people, the sword of the Spirit cuts to the marrow, forcing a decision.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
τινεϲ δε ελεγον ηθελον εξ αυτ αυτ πιαϲαι αυτον · αλ ουδιϲ επεβαλεν αυτω επ αυτον ταϲ χιραϲ ·

**English Translation**
And some were saying [they] wanted from [among] them to seize him; but no one laid hands on him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text exhibits confusion (`ελεγον ηθελον` - saying/wanted, `εξ αυτ αυτ` - from them them), mirroring the chaos of the crowd's intent. They desire to seize Him, yet they are paralyzed. Why? Because "no one laid hands on him." This is not merely human hesitation; it is divine restraint. The "hour" belongs to the Father. Until the appointed time of the Passion, the malice of men is held in check by the invisible sovereignty of God.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
ηλθον ουν οι ϋπη προϲ τουϲ αρχϊερειϲ και φα και λεγου αυτοιϲ εκεινοι · διατι ουκ ηγαγετε αυτον ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and those say to them: Why did you not lead him [here]?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The officers (`ϋπη`) return empty-handed to the architects of the plot, the priests and Pharisees (`φα`). The question "Why did you not lead him?" exposes the impotence of earthly authority against the Divine Word. The rulers expect obedience to their command, but the officers have encountered a higher Command. The worldly powers are baffled when their instruments of force are disarmed by the mere presence of Holiness.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ϋπη απεκριθηϲ · ουδεποτε ουτωϲ ανθρωποϲ ελαλη ωϲ ουτοϲ λα ο ελαληϲεν ουτωϲ ανθρωποϲ

**English Translation**
But the officers answered: Never did a man speak thus, as this [one] speaks... [correction: as this man spoke thus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stutters here (`ωϲ ουτοϲ λα ο ελαληϲεν`), as if the scribe himself is trembling at the officers' testimony. These rough guards, sent to arrest a man, have been arrested by His words. They confess, "Never did a man speak thus." They recognize a quality in His speech that is not human (`ανθρωποϲ`) but divine. It is the testimony of the simple-hearted shaming the hardened hearts of the scholars. The voice of the Shepherd is recognized even by the wolves' hirelings.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲαν αυτοιϲ οι φαριϲαι · μη και πεπλανηϲθαι ·

**English Translation**
The Pharisees answered them: Have you also been led astray?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The pride of the Pharisees (`φαριϲαι`) lashes out. They accuse the officers of being "led astray" (`πεπλανηϲθαι`), projecting their own deception onto others. They cannot conceive that uneducated guards could perceive a truth that they, the spiritual elite, have missed. This is the defense of a crumbling authority: to insult the intelligence of those who see the light they refuse to acknowledge.

**Verse 48**

**Greek Text**
μη τιϲ εκ των αρ πιϲτευει επιϲτευϲεν ειϲ αυτον η εκ τ φαριϲαιων ·

**English Translation**
Has anyone from the rulers believed in him, or from the Pharisees?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the false argument of consensus. They appeal to the "rulers" (`αρ`, *archontōn*) and the Pharisees as the standard of truth. The scribe corrects the tense (`πιϲτευει επιϲτευϲεν` - believes/believed), perhaps reflecting the ongoing hardening of their hearts. They ask, "Has anyone of us believed?" implying that truth is determined by the majority vote of the powerful. They are ignorant that Nicodemus, one of their own, is already silently among the believers. God chooses the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.

**Verse 49**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ο ο ουτοϲ ο μη γινωϲκων τον νομον · επαρατοι ειϲιν :

**English Translation**
But this [multitude], the one not knowing the law, are accursed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the venom of spiritual pride. The scribes truncate the very word for the people (*ochlos*), reducing them to a mere "this" (*ho houtos*), a gesture of dismissal. They claim possession of the Law (*nomos*), yet they violate its spirit of mercy by pronouncing a curse (*eparatoi*) upon the flock they are sworn to shepherd. It is the perennial error of the gnostic heretics and the arrogant scholar: to believe that salvation is found in the intellectual mastery of the text rather than in the submission to the Word made flesh. They despise the simple, yet God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise.

**Verse 50**

**Greek Text**
ειπεν δε νικοδη προϲ αυτουϲ ο ελθων προϲ αυτον προτερον ειϲ ων εξ αυτων

**English Translation**
But Nicodemus said to them, the one having come to him formerly, being one of them:

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark carefully the descriptors the Evangelist attaches to Nicodemus. First, he is the one who came "formerly" (*proteron*); this refers to his visit by night, indicating that the seed of faith planted in darkness is now attempting to sprout in the harsh light of the council. Second, he is "one of them" (*eis on ex auton*). This is the great tension of the pastoral office: to be within the structure of authority yet distinct in spirit. Nicodemus stands in the breach, a solitary voice of equity amidst a chorus of condemnation, proving that even within the hostile Sanhedrin, Grace can reserve a remnant for Itself.

**Verse 51**

**Greek Text**
μη ο νομοϲ ημ κρινι τον ανθρω · εαν μη ακου πρωτον παρ αυτου και γνω τι ποιει ·

**English Translation**
Does our law judge the man unless it hears first from him and knows what he does?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nicodemus does not yet openly confess the Christ, but he defends the Justice of God. He turns their own idol—the Law—against them. They who boasted of knowing the Law (v. 49) are now reminded by a brother that the Law forbids judgment without a hearing (*akouse proton*). The text here uses *krinei* (judges) in the present tense; the Law is an active, living standard, not a tool for summary execution. By demanding that the tribunal "know what he does," Nicodemus exposes their willful ignorance; they judge Jesus based on where He comes from, not on the works of power He performs.

**Verse 52**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη και ειπον αυτω · μη και ϲυ εκ τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ ει · εραυ και · ο προφητηϲ εκ τηϲ γαλιλαιαϲ ου εγειρεται ·

**English Translation**
They answered and said to him: Are you also from Galilee? Search and [see]: the prophet does not arise from Galilee.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the final blindness of the letter-bound scholar. They resort to mockery ("Are you also from Galilee?") rather than jurisprudence. Their command to "search" (*eraunason*) is ironic, for in their searching they have missed the Light. Note the singular reading in this Codex: "the prophet" (*o prophetes*), referring likely to the specific Prophet-like-Moses of Deuteronomy. They assert dogmatically that *the* Prophet does not rise from Galilee, ignoring the light that Isaiah promised would dawn on Galilee of the Gentiles. Thus, the chapter closes in this ancient text not with the woman taken in adultery—which is absent from this manuscript—but with the obstinate rejection of the Truth by the religious authorities. They shut the door on themselves, leaving the Christ outside their understanding, yet sovereign over history.
