**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
εγω ειμι . η αμπε η αληθινη · και ο πατηρ μου · ο γε εϲτιν ˙

**English Translation**
I am the [vine] the true; and my Father is the [husbandman].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the divine economy in the abbreviations of the scribe. The Lord proclaims *Ego eimi*—the unutterable Name—fully. Yet the earthly image of the *ampelos* (vine) is curtailed to *ampe*, and the Father’s role as *georgos* (husbandman) is reduced to *ge*. This signifies that while the nature of the Godhead is absolute, human language fractures when attempting to contain the mystery of the Incarnation and the Father's cultivation. The Father is the Tiller of the soil; the Son is the Root and Stock. We are but the growth upon this sacred wood.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
παν κλημα εν εμοι · μη φερον καρπον · αι αυτο ˙ και παν το καρπον φερ φερ · καθαιρει αυτον . ϊνα καρπον πλει φερη ·

**English Translation**
Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it [away]; and every [one] the fruit bear[ing] bear[ing], he cleanses it, that fruit [more] it might bear.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the twofold operation of the Husbandman: excision and purification. The scribe’s hand stutters, writing *pher pher* (bearing bearing), emphasizing the continuous, laborious necessity of producing good works. The barren branch is removed (*ai auto*), but the fruitful branch is not left untouched; it is pruned. Do not mistake the knife of affliction for wrath; it is the discipline of the Father intended to produce *plei* (more) abundance.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
ηδη ϋμειϲ καθαροι εϲτε · δια τον λογον ον λελα ·

**English Translation**
Already you are clean, through the word which [I have spoken].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Purity precedes the fruit. You are clean not by the law of Moses, nor by the washings of the Gentiles, but *dia ton logon*—through the Logos. The text abbreviates "I have spoken" to *lela*, suggesting the swiftness and finality of Christ's utterance. The Word acts as the pruning hook; it has already severed the dead wood from your souls, preparing you for the indwelling.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
μινα εν εμοι καγω εν ϋμιν · καθωϲ το κλημα ου δυναται καρπον φερειν αφ εαυτου · εαν μη μενη εν τη αμπε · ουτωϲ ουδε ϋ · εαν μη εν ε μενητε ·

**English Translation**
Abide in me and I in you; just as the branch is not able fruit to bear of itself, if not it abides in the [vine]; so neither [you], if not in [me] you abide.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imperative *mina* (abide) anchors the soul. The text is fragmented here—*ampe* for vine, *u* for you, *e* for me—mirroring the spiritual reality: apart from the whole, the parts are unintelligible. A branch severed from the *ampe* is merely wood for the fire. "Neither [you]" (*oude u*) stands starkly; without the mystical union, the human person is reduced to a cipher, unable to generate life.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
εγω ειμι η αμπελοϲ · ϋ τα κληματα · ο μενων εν εμοι καγω εν αυτω . ου φερει καρπον πολυν · οτι χωριϲ εμου ου δυναϲθαι ποιειν ουδεν ·

**English Translation**
I am the vine; [you] the branches; the [one] abiding in me and I in him, [this one] bears fruit much; because apart from me you are not able to do nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The hierarchy of grace is established: He is the *Ampelos*, we are the *klemata*. The scribe reduces "you" to the single letter *Upsilon* (ϋ), humbling our stature before the majesty of the Vine. The sentence concludes with a devastating double negative: "not able to do nothing." It is not merely that we cannot do great things; without the Christ-life flowing through the veins of the soul, we possess a total incapacity for any spiritual good.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ε ε μη τιϲ μενη μεινη εν ε · εβληθη εξω ωϲ το κλημα και ε · και ϲυνα αυτο · και ειϲ το πυρʼ βαλλουϲιν και καιεται

**English Translation**
[If not] anyone abides [abides] in [me], he was cast out as the branch and [withered]; and they gather [it], and into the fire they cast and it is burned.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Tremble at the stuttering of the text: *e e* (if not) and *mene meine* (abides abides). It is a desperate plea for perseverance. The consequence of apostasy is immediate: the one leaving the Vine *eblethe* (was cast out)—the aorist tense indicating the judgment is already passed in the act of separation. The branch becomes *e*—withered, dried up. The final end is *pyr* (fire), the consuming reality for that which refuses to bear life.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
εαν μει εν εμοι · και τα ρηματα μου εν υ εν υμιν μινη · οϲα εαν θε · αιτηϲεϲθε και γενηϲεται ϋ

**English Translation**
If [you abide] in me, and my words in [you] in you abide; whatever if [you will], ask and it shall happen [to you].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The condition for efficacious prayer is the indwelling of the *remata* (words) of Christ. The scribe writes "in you" twice (*en u en umin*), emphasizing the depth of this saturation. The human will (*the*) is truncated, suggesting that our will must be cut short and replaced by His. When the believer is so filled with the Word that his will is Christ's will, then the petition is granted, for he asks only what the Vine desires to produce.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
εν τουτω ε ο πατηρ μου · ϊνα καρπον πολυν φερηται · και γενηϲεϲθαι μοι μαθηται ·

**English Translation**
In this [was glorified] my Father, that fruit much you might bear; and [to become] to me disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The verb *edoxasthe* (was glorified) is reduced to a mere *epsilon* (ε). Even the smallest mark of the Spirit signifies the Father's glory. The purpose of our existence is not our own acclaim, but the Father's glory through our fruitfulness. Discipleship is not a static title but a dynamic becoming (*genesthai*); we prove ourselves disciples only by the weight of the harvest we bear.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
κα ηγαπηϲεν με ο πατηρ · καγω ηγα ϋμαϲ · μει εν τη αγαπη τη εμη

**English Translation**
[As] loved me the Father, and I [loved] you; [abide] in the love the mine.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chain of charity descends from the Father to the Son, and from the Son to the clay of humanity. The scribe abbreviates "loved" to *ega*, as if the act is too vast for the parchment. The command is *mei* (abide). We are not called to ascend to the Father by our own power, but to remain within the descending current of divine love that Christ has extended to us.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
εαν ταϲ εντολαϲ μου τηρηϲεται μενιται εν τη αγαπη τη εμη καθωϲ κα του πατροϲ μου ταϲ εντολαϲ μου ετηρηϲα · και με αυτου εν τη α ·

**English Translation**
If my commandments you keep, you will abide in the love the mine just as [I] of my Father the commandments [my?] kept; and [abide] of him in the [love].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound textual mystery appears: Christ speaks of keeping "my" commandments (*mou*) when referring to the Father. Is this a scribal error for *autou* (His), or a theological assertion that the Father's will and the Son's will are indistinguishable? By keeping the Father's commands, the Son remains in the *alpha* (α)—the beginning, the Love. Obedience is the vessel that holds the wine of love; break the vessel, and the love spills out.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα λελα ϋμιν · ϊνα η χαρα η εμη · εν υ μεινη · και η χαρα ϋμων πλη ·

**English Translation**
These things [I have spoken] to you, that the joy the mine in [you] might abide, and the joy of you might be [filled].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The goal of the rigorous pruning and the command to abide is not sorrow, but *chara* (joy). The Lord desires His own joy to dwell "in you" (*en u*). The final word is *ple*—an abbreviation for *plerothe* (fulfilled/filled). The text ends abruptly, just as our joy in this life is a foretaste, awaiting the fullness of the Kingdom. The spoken word (*lela*) is the vehicle of this completion.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
αυτη εϲτιν η εντολη η εμη ϊνα αγαπατε αλλη καθωϲ ηγα

**English Translation**
This is the commandment the mine that you love [one another] just as [I loved].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter's instruction culminates in the new commandment. It is mutual love (*allelous* truncated to *alle*). The standard is terrifyingly high: "just as I loved" (*kathos ega*). The sentence trails off at *ega*, leaving the act of love suspended. It is for us, the readers and doers of the Word, to complete the sentence with our lives, loving even unto death, as He did.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
μειζο ταυτηϲ αγαπ αγαπ ουδιϲ εχει · ϊνα τιϲ τ τ ψυχην αυτου θη · ϋ των φιλων αυ :

**English Translation**
Greater than this love love no one has; that someone the the soul of him should place; on behalf of the friends of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the stumbling of the scribe, writing *agapē* (love) twice, as if the magnitude of the charity described overwhelmed the hand. The text defines the summit of virtue: the placing (*thē*) of the *psychēn* (soul/life). It is not merely a risking, but a depositing of one's very existence as a ransom. The Lord sets the measure of friendship not in pleasant conversation, but in the blood of the covenant. He who lays down the soul has held nothing back; this is the perfection of the law.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ γαρ φιλοι μου εϲτε εαν ποιηται α εγω εντελλομαι ϋμιν ·

**English Translation**
For you friends of me are if you do [those things] which I command you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The particle *gar* (for) links this dignity to the sacrifice of the previous verse. We are friends purchased by that laying down of the soul. Yet, look at the condition: *ean poiēte* (if you do). Friendship with the Logos is not a passive affection but an active conformity to His will. To be a friend of the King is to execute the King's commands; disobedience strips away the title of friend and returns the soul to the status of a stranger.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ουκετι λεγω υμαϲ δουλουϲ · οτι ο δουλοϲ · ουκ οιδ τι ποιει αυτου ο : ϋμαϲ δε ειρηκα φι · οτι παντα · α ηκουϲα παρα του πατροϲ μου · εγνω ·

**English Translation**
No longer do I call you slaves; because the slave; does not know what does of him the [Lord]: but you I have called friends; because all things; which I heard from the Father of me; [I made known].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The distinction between the slave and the friend is *gnosis* (knowledge). The slave works the mill without understanding the purpose of the grain; the friend shares the counsel of the master. The text here abbreviates the Lord (*o :*) and the friends (*phi*), and ends abruptly on *egnō* (known/knew), perhaps indicating that the revelation is a mystery fully grasped only by the initiated. Christ has emptied the treasury of the Father's wisdom into the ears of the Apostles, removing the veil of servitude.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ουχ ϋμιϲ με εξελεξαϲθαι · αλλ ε εξελεξαμην ϋμαϲ · και εθηκα ϋ · ϊνα ϋμιϲ ϋπα και καρπον φερηται · και ο καρ ϋμων μενη ϊνα ο τι εαν αιτηϲηται τον πατερα · εν τω ονοματι μου δω ϋμιν ·

**English Translation**
Not you chose me; but I chose you; and placed you; that you might go and fruit might bear; and the fruit of you might remain that whatever you might ask the Father; in the name of me he might give to you.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Humility is enforced here: the initiative of salvation belongs entirely to the Divine. *Ego* (I) chose *hymas* (you). The purpose of this election is a "placing" (*ethēka*)—an ordination to apostolic labor. The fruit must not be ephemeral; it must *mene* (remain). Only the fruit that survives the threshing floor of judgment validates the prayer offered in His name. The scribe abbreviates "fruit" (*kar*), yet the demand for spiritual yield is full and heavy.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ταυτα εν αγαπατε αλλη ·

**English Translation**
These things [I command] love one another.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is stark and compressed. Whether the scribe omitted *entellomai* (I command) or whether the *en* stands for "in these things," the force is singular. The entire economy of salvation, the election, the fruit-bearing, culminates in this single duty: *agapate allēlous*. Without this mutual charity, the claim to know the Father is void.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ει ο κοϲμοϲ ϋμαϲ μειϲει · γι · οτι ε πρωτον υμων εμι μεμιϲηκεν ·

**English Translation**
If the world hates you; know; that me first of you [me] it has hated.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The inevitability of hatred (*misei*) serves as a consolation. The Codex presents a stutter in the Greek (*emi memisēken*), emphasizing the intensity of the world's rejection of the Incarnate Word. Christ is the *prōton*—the prototype of the persecuted. If the limbs are attached to the Head, they must share in the blows directed at the Head. To be loved by the world is to be severed from Christ.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ει εκ του κοϲμου ητε · ο κο αν το ϊδι ϊδι εφιλει οτι δε εκ του κοϲμου ουκ ε αλλ εγω εξελε εκ του κοϲμου · δια τουτο ο κοϲμοϲ μιϲει

**English Translation**
If from the world you were; the world would the own own love because however from the world not you are but I chose [you] out of the world; on account of this the world hates.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The world loves only its reflection. The scribe writes *idion* (own) twice (*idi idi*), unwittingly capturing the narcissistic echo of the mundane spirit. The Church is hated because it is alien; it has been "chosen out" (*exelexamēn*). This separation is the cause of the friction. We are not of the same substance as the fallen age; therefore, the age repels us as a body repels a foreign object.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
μνη τον λο ον ελαληϲα ουκ εϲτ εϲτ δουλοϲ μειζων του αυτου ει εμε εδιωξαν · και διωξουϲιν ˙ ει τον λογον μου ετηρη · και τον τηρηϲωϲ τηρηϲωϲ ·

**English Translation**
Remember the word which I spoke not is is a slave greater than the [lord] of him if me they persecuted; also [you] they will persecute; if the word of me they kept; also the [yours] they will keep they will keep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The servant cannot expect a throne where the Master found a cross. The text abounds with repetitions (*est est*, *tērēsōs tērēsōs*), as if the certainty of these outcomes—persecution and the keeping of the word—is being hammered into the faithful. If they chased the Shepherd, they will hunt the flock. Conversely, those few who kept the Logos of the Son are the only ones who will keep the teaching of the Bishop.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
αλλα ταυτα παντα ποιηϲουϲιν ποιηϲουϲιν ειϲ υμαϲ δια το ονομα μου οτι ου οιδαϲιν τον πεμ με

**English Translation**
But these things all they will do they will do unto you on account of the name of me because not they know the [one having] sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the scribe doubles the verb *poiēsousin* (they will do), emphasizing the relentless activity of the wicked. The violence is directed "on account of the Name." The root of this violence is theological ignorance: they do not know the Sender (*ton pempsanta*). To strike the messenger of Christ is to prove one's ignorance of the Father Almighty.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ει μη ηλ και ελαληϲα αυτοιϲ · αμαρτιαν ου ειχοϲαν · νυν δε προ ουκ εχουϲ περι τηϲ αμαρτιαϲ αυτων

**English Translation**
If not I came and spoke to them; sin not they would have had; now however excuse not they have concerning the sin of them.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The advent of the Word removes the cloak of ignorance. Before the Incarnation, mankind wandered in twilight; now the Sun has risen, and blindness is a choice. *Prophasin* (excuse/pretext) is stripped away. The presence of Christ renders the sin of rejection absolute and inexcusable. They do not merely fail to see; they refuse to look.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ο εμε μει · και τον πατε μου μιϲει

**English Translation**
The [one] me hating; also the Father of me hates.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the refutation of the heretics and the Jews who claim to worship the Creator while rejecting the Christ. The unity is indivisible. One cannot hate the Stream and love the Source. The hatred (*misei*) directed at the Son passes directly to the Father. There is no path to the Throne except through the Lamb.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ει τα εργα μη εποιηϲα εν αυτοιϲ · ἁ ουδιϲ αλ εποιηϲεν · α ουκ ειχο ˙ νυν δε και ε και με · και ε και τον πατερα μου ·

**English Translation**
If the works not I did among them; which no one other did; sin [sin] not they would have; now however both they have seen and have hated; both me and the Father of me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The "works" (*erga*) are the seal of divinity—miracles such as no other (*oudeis allos*) has performed. These works render their unbelief malicious. The text concludes with a terrible conjunction: *heōrakasin* (they have seen) and *memisēkasin* (they have hated). Sight did not lead to faith, but to hostility. This is the mystery of iniquity: to see the glory of God in the face of Christ and to respond with hatred for both the Son and the Father.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ϊνα πλη ο λογοϲ ο τω κοϲμω νομω αυτ αυτ γεγραμμενοϲ · ο εμιϲηϲαν με δωρεαν ˙

**English Translation**
But that might be fulfilled the word, the [one] in the world law of them [of them] written: They hated me without cause.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here the peculiar and heavy reading before us. The text does not merely say "in their law," but introduces the weight of the *kosmos*—`τω κοϲμω νομω` ("in the world law" or "in the law of the world"). Whether by scribal mystery or divine intent, this reading in the Codex brands the legalism of the persecutors as earthly, detached from the heavenly archetype. The repetition `αυτ αυτ` (likely for *autōn*, "of them") strikes the ear as a stutter of possession; they clung to the law as *theirs*, not God's. Thus, the prophecy is fulfilled: their hatred was `δωρεαν`—gratuitous, a gift of malice given freely in exchange for the gift of Grace. They reduced the divine statute to a worldly instrument, and in doing so, proved the Scripture true.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
οταν ελ ο παρακλητοϲ · ον εγω πεμψω ϋ παρα του πα · το π τηϲ α · ο παρα του πατροϲ εκπορευε · εκεινοϲ μαρ περι εμου ˙

**English Translation**
When comes the Paraclete, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of Truth who from the Father proceeds—that one will testify concerning me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here stands the fortress of our Orthodoxy, the Triune mystery inscribed in sacred shorthand. Note the Nomina Sacra: `πα` (Father), `π` (Spirit). The Son (`εγω`) sends the Paraclete, yet the Spirit proceeds (`εκπορευε`) eternally `παρα του πατροϲ` (from the Father). We see the distinction of persons but the unity of essence. The Spirit is defined here as `τηϲ α` (*tēs alētheias*), "of the Truth," binding Him intrinsically to the Son who is the Truth. The witness is not of a new revelation, but `περι εμου` (concerning me). The Paraclete does not speak of Himself, but illuminates the Incarnate Word. The abbreviated verbs `ελ` (comes) and `μαρ` (will testify) hasten the reader to the action: the Spirit's arrival is for the immediate defense of the Church.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
και ϋμειϲ δε μαρ οτι απ αρχηϲ μετ εμου εϲτε ·

**English Translation**
And you also testify, because from the beginning with me you are.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The divine testimony of the Paraclete is joined by the human testimony of the Apostles. `και ϋμειϲ δε` ("and you also") establishes the ecclesiastical hierarchy of witness: first the Divine Spirit, then the chosen vessels. The validity of their witness rests on the phrase `απ αρχηϲ` (from the beginning). They are not latecomers to the mystery; their existence (`εϲτε`, "you are") has been molded by their continuous abiding with the Word. It is a present reality rooted in the origin of His ministry. The Bishop rests his authority on this unbroken chain—the Spirit descending, the Apostles testifying, the Church preserving.
