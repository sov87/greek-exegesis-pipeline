**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
τοτε ουν λα ο πιλατοϲ τ εμαϲτιγωϲεν ·

**English Translation**
Then therefore Pilate took [him] and scourged [him].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrible brevity of the scribe. The particle *oun* (therefore) binds the suffering of the Lord to the rejection of the crowd in the preceding chapter; because they chose a robber, the Just One is taken (*la*—abbreviated for *labōn*) and scourged. The text collapses the violence into a single word, *emastigōsen*. There is no delay between the taking and the striking. The flesh of the Word, which was made manifest to heal our infirmities, is here subjected to the law’s brutality, yet the silence of the victim is louder than the whip.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
και οι ϲτρατιωται πλεξαντεϲ ϲτεφα εξ ακανθων επεθηκεν επεθηκαν αυτου τη κεφαλη · και ϊμα πορφυρουν περιεβαλον αυτ ·

**English Translation**
And the soldiers, having plaited a crown of thorns, placed—[correction: they placed]—it on his head; and a purple garment they cast around him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See here the mystery of the curse reversed. The earth, cursed to bring forth thorns for Adam, now offers its thorns to crown the Second Adam. The scribe’s hand stumbles, writing *epethēken* (he placed) before correcting to *epethēkan* (they placed), revealing the collective guilt of the cohort. They clothe Him in purple (*porphuroun*), intending mockery of His royalty, yet unwittingly they confess the truth: He is the King of Martyrs, robed in the color of blood and empire.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και ηρχοντο προϲ αυτον και ελεγον · χαιρε βαϲιλευ τ ϊουδαιων · και εδι αυτω ραπι

**English Translation**
And they were coming to him and saying: Hail, King of the Jews; and they gave him blows.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The imperfect tense *ērchonto* (they were coming) suggests a relentless, repetitive procession of scorn. They use the salutation of Caesar, *Chaire* (Hail), for the Carpenter. The text abbreviates the violence—*rapismata* is shortened to *rapi*—as if the scribe hurries past the indignity. They offer words of high honor with hands of violence, a liturgy of hell where the "King of the Jews" is acknowledged only to be struck.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθεν πα ο πιλατοϲ εξω και λεγει αυτοιϲ · ϊ αγω αυτ εξω ϊνα γνωτε τι αιτιαν ουδεμιαν ευρι ουχ ευριϲκω εν αυτω ·

**English Translation**
Pilate went out again outside and says to them: Behold, I lead him outside to you, that you may know that cause none I find—[correction: I do not find]—in him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate acts as the unwilling herald. He leads the Lamb out (*exō*) to the wolves. Mark the scribe’s correction: *euriskō* (I find) is overwritten to emphasize the negation *ouch euriskō* (I do *not* find). Even the pagan judge, in his vacillation, must publicly declare the sinlessness of the Victim. He finds no *aitian* (cause/guilt), for how can guilt be found in the Source of all righteousness?

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθεν ο ο εξω · φορων τ τ ακανθινον ϲτε · και πορ ϊματιον ˙ και λεγει αυτοιϲ · ϊ ο ανθρωποϲ :

**English Translation**
[Jesus] went out outside, wearing the thorny crown and purple garment. And he says to them: Behold the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text stammers with "o o" (The... The [Jesus]), as if trembling to name Him in this state. *Ecce Homo*. Pilate presents "The Man"—not merely a man, but the Archetype, the restored Image of God, now disfigured by the sins of the world. He wears the symbols of his passion—the *akanthinon stephanon* (thorny crown)—as regalia. He goes "outside" the praetorium, stepping towards the altar of the world.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
οτε ουν ϊδον αυτ αυτ οι αρχϊερειϲ και οι ϋπηρεται εκραξ εκραυγαϲαν · ϲταυρωϲον ϲταυ αυτον και λεγει αυτοιϲ ο πι · λαβετε αυτ ϋμειϲ και ϲταυρω εγω γαρ ουχ ευ εν αυτω αι ·

**English Translation**
When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried—[correction: shouted]—Crucify, crucify him. And Pilate says to them: Take him yourselves and crucify [him], for I do not find in him cause.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sight of the suffering Just One does not elicit pity in the religious leaders, but bloodlust. The scribe initially wrote *ekraxan* (cried) but corrected it to the more visceral *ekraugasan* (shouted/screamed), capturing the demonic intensity of the mob. The chant is rhythmic: *staurōson staurōson*. Pilate’s retort, "Take him yourselves," is a mockery of their powerlessness, yet he reiterates the verdict of innocence (*ouch euriskō*) even while facilitating the execution.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲ οι ϊουδαιοι · ημειϲ νομον εχομεν και κατα τον νομ οφιλει αποθαν αποθαν · οτι εαυτ εαυτ εποιηϲεν

**English Translation**
The Jews answered: We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, to die; because he made himself [himself]...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the heart of the rejection. They cling to the *nomon* (law) to destroy the Giver of the Law. The text repeats *apothanein* (to die), emphasizing the necessity of death in their minds. The verse ends abruptly in this manuscript witness: "because he made himself..." The object is implied or lost in the stuttering *eaut eaut*, but we know the charge is blasphemy—that He made Himself the Son of God. They use the truth as the indictment.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
οτε ο ο ηκουϲεν ο πιλα τον λογον του μαλλον εφο ·

**English Translation**
When therefore Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The pagan heart trembles before the Divine mystery. Pilate was managing a riot; now he faces a deity. Upon hearing "this word" (that Jesus claims divine sonship), his political anxiety turns to *phobos* (fear). The repetition "o o" again marks the text, perhaps reflecting the hesitation and confusion of the moment. The judge is judged by his own prisoner.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
και ειϲηλθεν ειϲ το πραιτωρι παλ και λεγει τω πο ει ϲυ · ο δε α ουκ εδω αυτω

**English Translation**
And he entered into the praetorium again and says to Jesus: Whence are thou? But [Jesus/Answer] he gave not to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate seeks the *pothen*—the origin. He asks not "Who are you?" but "Where are you from?" sensing an origin not of this earth. The text is stark: "But... gave not to him." The silence of Christ is the judgment of the world. He does not cast pearls before swine, nor does He defend His ontology to one who thinks power resides in Rome.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ουν αυ ο πιλατοϲ · εμοι ου λαλιϲ · ουκ οιδαϲ οτι εξουϲιαν εχω απολυϲαι ϲε και ε εχω ϲταυ ϲε ·

**English Translation**
Therefore Pilate says to him: To me speakest thou not? Knowest thou not that I have authority to release thee and I have [authority] to crucify thee?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The arrogance of dust addressing the Creator. Pilate flaunts his *exousian* (authority), placing the power to "release" before the power to "crucify," trying to bribe the Lord into speech. He believes his jurisdiction extends over the Word of Life. The scribe abbreviates "authority" (*exousian*) to *e* in the second clause, rushing through the pompous claim.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
απεκρι αυτω ο · ου εχιϲ εξουϲιαν κατ εμου ουδεμι · ει μη ην δεδο ϲοι ανωθ ανωθ · δια τουτο ο παρα με ϲοι μειζο αμαρτιαν εχει

**English Translation**
Jesus answered him: Thou hast not authority against me none, if it were not given to thee from above; on account of this, the one having delivered me to thee has greater sin.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord breaks silence to reorder the cosmos. Pilate has no power (*oudemian*) except that which is *dedomenon anōthen* (given from above). The double *anōthen* in the manuscript underscores the divine concession allowing this evil. Jesus distinguishes degrees of guilt: Pilate acts in ignorance and weakness, but Caiaphas (the one delivering) acts with malice against the light, bearing "greater sin." Even in judgment, Christ acts as the Moral Arbiter.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
εκ τουτου ο πιλα εζητει απολυ αυτον · οι δε ϊ ελεγον εκραζον λεγοντεϲ · εαν τουτον απο · ουκ ει φιλοϲ του καιϲαροϲ · παϲ ο βαϲιλεα εαυτον ποιων αντιλεγει τω καιϲαρι ·

**English Translation**
From this Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews were saying—[correction: cried out]—saying: If this man thou release, thou art not friend of Caesar; everyone making himself king speaks against Caesar.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The final capitulation. Pilate seeks to release (*apolusai*), but the crowd plays their trump card: Caesar. The scribe again corrects the mild *elegon* (were saying) to the violent *ekrazon* (cried out). They renounce their Messianic hope to secure Jesus' death, declaring that any other king "speaks against Caesar." To kill the Son of God, they idolize the Roman tyrant. This is the apostasy of Israel: preferring the chains of Rome to the freedom of Christ.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ο ουν πιλατοϲ α των λογ τουτων ηγαγεν εξω τον · και ε επι βη ειϲ τοπον λεγομενον λιθο εβραϊ γολγοθα δε γαββαθα ·

**English Translation**
Pilate therefore, hearing these words, led him outside; and sat upon the bema into a place called Litho[strotos], in Hebrew Golgotha, but Gabbatha.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe here a profound textual mystery in our codex. While the place of judgment is the Stone Pavement (*Lithostrotos*), the scribe has written "in Hebrew Golgotha," and then added "but Gabbatha." It is as if the pen, moved by the Spirit, rushes forward to the place of the Skull (*Golgotha*) even while the Judge sits at the Pavement (*Gabbatha*). The judgment and the execution are fused; the sentence of the stone pavement is already the reality of the skull. Pilate sits on the *bema*, the judgment seat, yet the text whispers that this judgment is already the sacrifice of Calvary.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
ην δε παραϲκευη του παϲχα ωρα ωϲ εκτη τριτη και λεγει τοιϲ ϊουδαιοιϲ ϊ ο βαϲιλευϲ ϋμ ϋμ ·

**English Translation**
Now it was the preparation of the pascha, hour about sixth third; and he says to the Jews: Behold your your King.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We encounter here a difficult reading, "hour about sixth third." The scribe struggles between the reckoning of the day. Is it the sixth hour (noon), as the sun climbs high to expose the deed? Or the third (mid-morning), as Mark records? The manuscript preserves both, a "sixth-third" hour, suspending time itself at the moment of the Paschal preparation. Note also the stutter in the address: "Behold your your King" (*hymōn hymōn*). The repetition emphasizes the tragic irony; He is truly theirs, the very hope of their fathers, yet they stand ready to disown Him.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
οι δε ελεγον αρον εκραυγαϲαν ουν εκινοι εκραυγαϲαν ουν εκινοι αρον αρον ϲταυρωϲ ϲταυρωϲ αυτον · λεγει αυτοιϲ ο πιλατοϲ · τον βα ϲταυ · απεκριθη οι αρχϊερειϲ · ουκ εχομεν βαϲι ει μη καιϲαρα ˙ ‾̷‾

**English Translation**
But they said, Take [him] away! They shouted therefore, those ones, they shouted therefore, those ones: Take [him] away, take [him] away, crucify, crucify him! Pilate says to them: The King [shall I] crucify? The chief priests answered: We have no king except Caesar.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is chaotic, repeating "they shouted therefore, those ones" twice, mirroring the frenzied, incoherent rage of the mob. The cry "Take away, take away" (*aron aron*) seeks to remove the Holy One from the earth. But the ultimate blasphemy lies in the final clause: "We have no king except Caesar." In this sentence, the priesthood of Aaron formally abdicates its theocracy. By claiming Caesar as their sole king, they reject the sovereignty of God, thereby ending the old covenant by their own confession.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
τοτε ουν παρεδω αυτοιϲ αυτ · ϊνα ϲταυρωθη οι δε λαβοντεϲ παραλαβοντεϲ ουν τον απηγαγον αυ

**English Translation**
Then therefore he handed [him] over to them that he might be crucified. And they having taken, having received therefore the [Jesus], led [him] away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
See how the scribe emphasizes the culpability of the recipients. They are described as "having taken, having received" (*labontes paralabontes*). This double participation confirms they did not merely accept a prisoner; they actively seized the Victim. Pilate "handed over" (*paredōken*), an act of betrayal mirroring Judas, and they "led him away," removing the Scapegoat outside the camp to bear the sins of the people.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
και βαϲταζ εαυτω τον ϲταυ εξηλθεν ειϲ τον λεγομενον κρανιου τοπον ο λεγεται εβραϊϲτι γολγοθα

**English Translation**
And bearing the cross for himself, he went out into the place called of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He bears the wood "for himself" (*heautō*). Unlike the synoptic account of Simon of Cyrene, John's testimony focuses on Christ as the true Isaac, carrying the wood of the burnt offering upon his own shoulders. He goes "out" (*exēlthen*), leaving the holy city which has rejected Him, to the place of the Skull. Where death reigns (the skull), there Life enters to conquer.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
οπου αυ εϲταυρωϲαν . και μετ αυτου αλ δυο εντευ και εντευθ · μεϲον δε τον

**English Translation**
Where they crucified him, and with him others two, on this side and on that, and in the middle the [Jesus].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is sparse and brutal: "Where they crucified him." No details of the agony are needed; the fact suffices. He is placed "in the middle" (*meson*). Even in death, He is central. He separates the two thieves as judgment separates the sheep from the goats. He hangs in the midst of transgressors, fulfilling the prophecy that He was numbered with the lawless, yet He remains the axis upon which the world turns.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
εγραψεν δε και τι ο πιλατοϲ · και εθηκεν επι του ϲταυρου · ην δε γε ο ναζωραιοϲ ο βαϲι των ϊουδαι ·

**English Translation**
And Pilate wrote also a title, and placed it upon the cross; and it was written: The Nazarene, the King of the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Pilate writes a "title" (*titlon*). Though intended as mockery, it serves as the first Gospel tract published to the nations. "The Nazarene" identifies his humanity and humility; "The King of the Jews" identifies his sovereignty. Pilate acts as an unwitting prophet; he fixes the truth to the wood, and no human hand can erase the royalty of the Crucified.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
τουτον ουν τον τιτλον πολλοι ανεγνωϲαν των ϊουδαι οτι εγγυϲ ην ο τοποϲ τηϲ πολεωϲ οπου εϲτ(αυρ)ωθη ο κ(αι) ην γεγραμ εβραϊϲτι · ρωμαϊϲτι ˙ ελληνιϲτι ·

**English Translation**
This title therefore many of the Jews read, because near was the place of the city where the [Lord/Jesus] was crucified; and it was written in Hebrew, in Roman, in Greek.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The proximity to the city ensures the testimony is public. The inscription is trilingual: Hebrew for the religion of the old covenant, Roman (Latin) for the power of the empire, and Greek for the wisdom of the philosophers. Thus, Christ is proclaimed King over Religion, Power, and Wisdom. The whole inhabited world is summoned to read the identity of its Creator upon the tree.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ελεγον ουν τω πιλα οι αρχιερειϲ των ϊουδαιων μη γραφε ο βαϲιλευϲ των ϊουδαι αλλ οτι εκει ειπεν βαϲι ειμι των ϊου ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate: Do not write, The King of the Jews, but that that one said: King I am of the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chief priests perceive the danger of the truth. They wish to change the ontological statement ("He is King") into a subjective claim ("He said, I am King"). They desire to reduce the reality of God's Anointed to a mere boast of a dying man. They cannot abide the truth staring at them from the Cross, for if He is King, they are regicides.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο πιλατοϲ ο γεγρα γεγραφα ·

**English Translation**
Pilate answered: What I have written, I have written.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the stutter in the scribe's hand (*gegra gegrapha*), emphasizing the finality. Pilate, usually so vacillating, suddenly becomes immovable as rock. This is the work of God. The Gentile governor guards the truth that the Jewish priesthood rejects. The written word stands irrevocable, a testament that the Kingship of Christ is established forever and cannot be altered by the whims of men.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
οι ουν ϲτρατιωται οι ϲταυ τον ελαβον τα ϊματι αυτου · και εποι τεϲϲερα μερη εκαϲτω ϲτρατιω μεροϲ κ(αι) τον χιτωνα ην δε ο χιτων αραφοϲ εκ των ανωθεν ϋ δι ολου ·

**English Translation**
The soldiers therefore, [when] they crucified him, took his garments—and made four parts, to each soldier a part—and the tunic; now the tunic was seamless, from the top [woven] throughout.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The outer garments are divided into four, signifying the spread of the Gospel to the four corners of the earth. But the tunic (*chitōn*) is seamless (*araphos*) and woven from the top (*anōthen*). This signifies the unity of the Church, which comes from above (heaven) and cannot be rent by schism. It also points to the High Priestly nature of Christ, for the high priest's robe was woven of one piece. He is both Victim and Priest.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ει ουν προϲ αυ εαυτουϲ · μη ϲχιϲωμ αυτον · αλλα λαχω περι αυτου τινοϲ εϲται · ϊνα η γραφη πληρωθη διεμεριϲαντο μου τα ϊματια εαυτοιϲ · και επι τον ϊματι μου εβαλ κληρον · οι μεν ο ϲτρατιωται ταυτα εποιηϲαν

**English Translation**
They said therefore to themselves: Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled: They divided my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture they cast a lot. The soldiers indeed therefore did these things.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Even the gambling of pagan soldiers is bound by the fetters of prophecy. They resolve "not to tear" the seamless robe, preserving the integrity of the faith. They cast lots, fulfilling the Psalm (LXX Ps 21:19) to the letter. The Evangelist concludes with "The soldiers indeed therefore did these things," marveling that these ignorant executioners were, in fact, liturgical actors performing the script written by the Spirit centuries prior.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
ϊϲτηκι δε παρα τω ϲταυ του η μητηρ αυτου · και η αδελ τηϲ μητροϲ αυ μαριαμʼ · η του κλωπα · και μαριαμ η μαγδαληνη

**English Translation**
Now there stood by the cross [stau] of him his mother; and the sister [adel] of his mother, Mariam the [wife] of Clopas; and Mariam the Magdalene.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal brevity in *ϲταυ* (cross) and *αδελ* (sister); the sacred realities are abbreviated to save parchment, yet the mystery remains full. While the male disciples fled in terror, a fortress of women remained. Three Marys stand as a triad of witness: the Virgin Mother, the kinswoman, and the penitent Magdalene. The new Eve stands beside the Tree of Life (the Cross), reversing the disobedience of the first Eve who stood by the tree of knowledge.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
δε ϊδων την και τον μαθητην πα ον ηγαπα · και λεγει τη μητρι · γυναι · ϊδου ο ϋϊοϲ ϲου ·

**English Translation**
[He] seeing the [female article] and the disciple [standing by] whom he loved; and says to the mother: Woman, behold thy son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is elliptical; *την* (the) hangs without its noun *μητέρα* (mother), as if the scribe trembled to write the name of the Theotokos in such a moment of grief. The Lord addresses her as *Gunai* (Woman), not to diminish her, but to identify her as the Woman of Genesis 3:15 whose seed crushes the serpent. He creates a new family based not on flesh, but on the Spirit, entrusting the Virgin to the Beloved Disciple, and the Church to her care.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
ειτα λεγει τω μαθη · ειδε η μητηρ ϲου · και απ εκινηϲ τηϲ ωραϲ ελαβεν αυτ ο μαθητηϲ ειϲ τα ϊ

**English Translation**
Then he says to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his own [home].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes *ειϲ τα ϊ*, abbreviating *ίδια* (his own things/home) to a single iota. This signifies that the disciple made space for her in his innermost life. To take the Mother of God into one's home is the duty of every faithful soul; she is the ark of the new covenant, and where the ark rests, there is blessing. The transfer of sonship is complete; John represents all the faithful who receive Mary as mother.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
μετα τουτο ειδωϲ ο · οτι παντα ηδη τετελεϲται · ϊνα πλη η γραφη · λεγει · διψω ˙

**English Translation**
After this, knowing [Jesus] that all things are already finished; that the scripture might be fulfilled [pli], says: I thirst.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The subject *ο* (the) stands alone, the name of Jesus implied in the article. He says "I thirst" not merely from physical dehydration, though his flesh was truly parched, but to fulfill the Psalm which says, "In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." It is a thirst for the salvation of souls. The word *τετελεϲται* (it is finished) appears here in the narrator's voice before it is in Christ's mouth; the work of redemption is an accomplished fact in the mind of God.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ϲκευοϲ δε εκει οξουϲ μεϲτον · ϲπογγον ουν με του οξουϲ · ϋϲϲω περιθεντεϲ · προϲηνεγκαν αυ τω ϲτοματι ˙

**English Translation**
Now a vessel lay there full of vinegar; therefore a sponge full [me] of the vinegar, having put it around hyssop, they brought to his mouth.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Note the *ϋϲϲω* (hyssop). This is no accidental detail. In Egypt, the blood of the Paschal lamb was applied to the lintels with a bunch of hyssop. Here, the hyssop raises the vinegar to the lips of the true Lamb. The world offers its sour wine—the bitterness of sin and rejection—to the One who offers the new wine of the Kingdom. He tastes the bitterness of death so that we might taste the sweetness of life.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
ο ουν ελαβεν το οξοϲ ο ειπεν · τετε · και κλειναϲ την κεφαλην πα το π ·

**English Translation**
Therefore when [he] took the vinegar [he] said: [It is finished]; and bowing the head [handed over] the [spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here is starkly abbreviated: *τετε* for *τετέλεσται* (it is finished) and *πα το π* for *παρέδωκεν το πνεῦμα* (handed over the spirit). It is as if the scribe could not bear to write the full reality of the Lord's death. He "bowed his head" first, then died; unlike other men who die and then their heads fall. This proves he is the Lord of life, laying it down of his own accord. The debt is paid (*tetelestai*); the Spirit is voluntarily released (*paredoken*).

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
οι ουν ϊουδαιοι ε παραϲκευη ην · ϊνα μη μινη επι του ϲταυρου τα ϲω εν τω ϲαββα · ην γαρ μεγαλη ημερα εκεινου του ϲαββατου · ηρω ουν τον πι · ϊνα κατεα αυτων τα ϲκελη · και αρθω ·

**English Translation**
The Jews therefore, since [e] it was Preparation, that the bodies [so] might not remain [mini] on the cross on the Sabbath (for great was the day of that Sabbath), asked therefore [Pilate] that their legs might be broken [katea], and they be taken away.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Hypocrisy is unveiled. They are scrupulous about the *ϲαββα* (Sabbath) rest while murdering the Lord of the Sabbath. It was a "Great Day" because the Passover coincided with the Sabbath, a double holiness they profaned by their malice. They requested the *crurifragium* (breaking of legs) to hasten death, treating the temple of God's body as mere refuse to be cleared away for their ritual purity.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ηλθον ουν οι ϲτρατιωται · και του μεν πρωτου κατε τα ϲκελη · και του αλλου · του ϲυν αυτω ˙

**English Translation**
Therefore the soldiers came, and of the first indeed [they broke] the legs, and of the other who was [crucified] with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The soldiers break the legs of the thieves, for they are yet held by death. The breaking of bones signifies the destruction of strength. These two thieves represent the judgment of the world: one penitent, one blasphemous, yet both subject to the physical agony of the law's penalty. The text abbreviates *κατε* (broke) and *ϲυν* (with), rushing through the violence inflicted on the guilty to pause at the Innocent One.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
επι δε τον ελθοντεϲ ευρ ωϲ ϊδον αυτον ηδη ηδη τεθνη και ου κατε αυτου τα ϲκε ·

**English Translation**
But coming to the [Jesus], [found?] as they saw him already already dead, and [broke] not his legs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe repeats *ηδη* (already) twice: *ηδη ηδη*. This emphasis confirms the reality of his death against any future heresies claiming he only swooned. He was "already, already" dead. They did not break his legs (*σκε*), fulfilling the type of the Paschal Lamb in Exodus, of which not a bone shall be broken. His integrity remains even in death; the structure of the New Temple is unshattered.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
αλλ ειϲ των ϲτρα λογχη αυτου την πλευ ενυξεν · και ε ευθυϲ αι και ϋδωρ ·

**English Translation**
But one of the soldiers [stra] with a spear pierced his side, and [came out] immediately blood [ai] and water.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
From the side (*πλευ*) of the sleeping Adam, Eve was formed; from the side of the dead Christ, the Church is born. The *αι* (blood) and *ϋδωρ* (water) signify the two great mysteries: Baptism (water) which cleanses, and the Eucharist (blood) which redeems. The scribe writes *ε* for *exelthen* (came out)—the flow of grace is immediate (*euthys*). The fountain of life is opened in the midst of death.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
και ο εωρακωϲ μεμαρ · και αλη αυτου εϲτιν η μαρτυρια · κακει οιδεν οτι αλη λεγει · ϊνα και ϋ πιϲτευητε πιϲτευϲητε ·

**English Translation**
And he who has seen has testified [memar], and true [ali] is his testimony; and he knows that he says true things, that you also might believe [believe].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist insists on ocular proof. *Μεμαρ* stands for *memartyreken* (has testified). He appeals to his own knowledge (*oiden*) to ground our faith. The manuscript presents a variation or correction: *πιϲτευητε πιϲτευϲητε* (believe, believe)—perhaps shifting from present continuous to aorist, or simply emphasizing the urgency. Faith is the goal of this entire narrative; not history for history's sake, but history for salvation's sake.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ε γαρ ταυτα ϊνα η γραφη πληρω ˙ οϲτουν ου ϲυν απ αυτου ˙

**English Translation**
For these things [happened] that the scripture might be fulfilled: A bone shall not be [broken] of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter concludes with the seal of prophecy. *Οϲτουν* (bone) refers to the righteous man of the Psalms and the Lamb of the Exodus. *Συν* stands for *syntribesetai* (shall be crushed/broken). God protects the framework of his Anointed. Even in the humiliation of the cross, the divine decree preserves his body from total desecration, signaling that while he died, he was not conquered.

**Verse 37**

**Greek Text**
και παλιν ετερα γραφη λεγει ˙ οψον ειϲ ον εξεκεν :

**English Translation**
And again another scripture says: They shall look into whom they pierced.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here the Prophet Zechariah speaks through the Evangelist. The text uses the abbreviated form *exeken* for the piercing, a sharp and singular act. Observe the preposition *eis* (into/unto); they do not merely look *at* Him, but *into* Him, penetrating the mystery of the God-man whose side was opened. This "looking" is the gaze of the world upon its judgment and its salvation. The wound made by the spear opens the way for the eye of faith to see the blood and water, the twin fonts of the Church's life.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
μετα δε ταυτα ηρω τον πιλατ ϊωϲηφʼ ο απο αρι · ων μαθη του · κεκρυμ δε δια τον φοβον των ϊουδαι · ϊνα αρη το ϲω του · και επε ο πιλατοϲ ηλθον ηλθεν ουν και η αυτον ηρεν το ϲωμα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And after these things, Joseph the [one] from Ari[mathea] asked Pilate—being a disciple of His, but hidden through the fear of the Jews—that he might take the body of His; and Pilate permitted. Therefore he came [they came] and took him, [he] took His body.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe struggles here, stuttering between *ēlthon* (they came) and *ēlthen* (he came), and repeating the taking of the body. This reflects the confusion and haste of that dark hour. Joseph, formerly *kekrym[menos]* (hidden) by fear, now steps into the light of the governor's hall. The death of the Master has killed the fear in the disciple. He asks for the *sōma* (body), no longer just the Teacher, but the sacred vessel of the Incarnation, now silent. Pilate grants what he does not value, unknowingly handing over the Life of the world to the care of the faithful.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
ηλθεν δε και νικοδημοϲ ο ελθων προϲ τ τ νυκτοϲ το πρωτ πρωτ εχων ελιγμα φερων μιγμα ϲζμυρ και αλοηϲ ωϲ λιτραϲ εκατον

**English Translation**
And Nicodemus also came, the [one] having come to [Him] by night at the first, having a roll, bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred liters.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound reading appears in this Codex: *echōn eligma pherōn migma* (having a roll, bearing a mixture). The standard text speaks only of the mixture (*migma*), but here the scribe preserves *eligma*—a roll, or a wrap. Does Nicodemus bring the linen roll *and* the spices? Or is this a confusion of the ear? Spiritually, we accept both: he brings the *eligma* (the binding for the dead) and the *migma* (the preservation for the living memory). The weight is royal—one hundred liters—signifying that He who died as a criminal is buried as a King. The repetition of *prōt* (first) emphasizes his former darkness, now illuminated by this act of devotion.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
ελα ουν το ϲωμα του · και εδηϲαν αυτο οθονιοιϲ με των αρωματων καθωϲ εθοϲ ην εϲτιν τοιϲ ϊουδαιοιϲ εν ·

**English Translation**
Therefore they took the body of His, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, just as the custom was [is] for the Jews to bury.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text corrects itself regarding the custom: *ēn estin* (was... is). The Law "is" eternal, yet for Christ, it "was" a fulfilled type. They bind the Creator with linen (*othoniois*), limiting the Limitless One. This binding with spices is the manner of the Jews, intended to preserve the flesh against corruption; yet they know not that this Flesh cannot see corruption. They wrap Him for a long sleep, but He rests only for a short Sabbath.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
ην δε εν τω τοπω οπου εϲταυρωθη κηποϲ · και εν τω κηπω μνημιον καινον · εν ω ου ουδεπω ην τε ·

**English Translation**
Now there was in the place where He was crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which not [one] was not yet laid.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cycle of Eden is closed. In a garden, the first Adam fell by a tree; in a garden, the Second Adam is buried after the Tree of the Cross. The tomb is *kainon* (new)—unused. As Christ was born from a Virgin womb where no man had been, so He is laid in a Virgin tomb where no corpse had rotted. The double negative *ou oudepō* (not not yet) emphasizes the absolute purity of this resting place. It is a bed prepared solely for the Lord of Life.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
εκει ο δια την παραϲκευ των ϊουδαιων · ο εγγυϲ ην το μνη οπου εθη τον ι :

**English Translation**
There therefore, on account of the Preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter concludes with haste and proximity. The *Paraskeuē* (Preparation) presses upon them; the Sabbath draws nigh. They lay *ton I[ēsoun]* (Jesus) nearby. Providence ordained the tomb's closeness not merely for convenience, but so that the Resurrection might occur in the very shadow of the Cross. The work is finished; the resting begins. The true Sabbath has arrived, where God rests in the earth, awaiting the dawn of the Eighth Day.
