**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
ην δε ανθρωποϲ εκ των φαριϲαι νικοδημοϲ ονο ονομα αυτω αρχων των ϊουδαιων ·

**English Translation**
Now there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus name name to him, a ruler of the Jews.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe, brethren, the scribe’s hesitation in the duplication `ονο ονομα` (name name). It is as if the text stammers to record a name so heavy with earthly dignity yet so light in spiritual understanding. He is `εκ των φαριϲαι` (of the Pharisees), a sect of separation, yet he comes to the One who unites. He is a `αρχων` (ruler), yet he approaches the King of Ages as a novice. The text presents him defined by his title and his name, emphasizing the identity of the old man which must be shed before the new birth can occur.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ ηλθεν νυκτοϲ προϲ αυτον · και ει αυτω · ραββει · οιδαμεν οτι απο εληλυθαϲ δι · και ου δυναται ταυτα τα ϲημια ποιειν α ϲυ ποιειϲ · εαν μη ῆ ο μετ αυτου ˙

**English Translation**
This one came by night to him; and said to him: Rabbi; we know that from [God] you have come [as] teacher; and not is able these signs to do which you do; if not be the [One] with him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He comes `νυκτοϲ` (by night), shrouded in the darkness of the law that has not yet been illumined by grace. Note the ellipse in `απο εληλυθαϲ` (from... you have come); the word for God is absent in the letter, implied only in the spirit, showing Nicodemus knows the origin but cannot name the Essence. He confesses `ου δυναται` (not is able)—man is powerless to replicate the `ϲημια` (signs) of the Incarnate Word. The final phrase `εαν μη ῆ ο μετ αυτου` leaves the subject `ο` (the One) hanging, a mystery; for unless the Being Himself is present, the works of God cannot manifest.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο και ειπεν αυτω αμ αμην λεγω ϲοι · ε μη τιϲ γεννη ανωθεν · ου δυ ϊδειν την βα του :

**English Translation**
Answered the [Jesus] and said to him: Amen Amen I say to you: if not someone be born from above, not able to see the kingdom of the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord replies not to the man's flattery but to his necessity. The duplication `αμ αμην` (Amen Amen) seals the truth with double authority. The condition is absolute: `ε μη` (if not). The word `γεννη` (born) is abbreviated, as if the mystery of this birth is too swift for the pen. Without this birth `ανωθεν` (from above), the soul is `ου δυ` (not able) even to perceive, let alone enter, the `βα` (Kingdom). The vision of the divine requires a divine eye, which is only granted through the new generation.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
λεγει προϲ αυτον ο νικοδημοϲ · πωϲ δυναται ανθρω γερων ων γεν · μη δυ ειϲ την κοι τηϲ μητροϲ αυτου δευτερον ει και γεννη ·

**English Translation**
Says to him Nicodemus: How is able a man old being to be born? Not able into the womb of the mother of him a second time to enter and be born.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nicodemus remains trapped in the flesh. He speaks of the `ανθρω` (man) who is `γερων` (old), seeing only the decay of nature. His mind descends to the `κοι` (womb) of earth, unable to comprehend the womb of grace. He asks `πωϲ` (how), a question of mechanics, whereas the operation of God is a matter of power. He views the return to the origin as a physical impossibility (`μη δυ`), blind to the spiritual restoration that makes the old man new without returning to the earth.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη κ(αι) ειπεν · αμην αμην ‾‾ λεγω ϲοι εαν μη τιϲ εξ υδατοϲ και γεννηθη · ου δυνα ειδειν ειϲελθειν ειϲελθιν την βα των ουρα του ·

**English Translation**
Answered and said: Amen Amen I say to you, if not someone from water and be born; not able to see to enter to enter the kingdom of the heavens of the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the sacred font explicitly commanded. The text reads `εξ υδατοϲ και γεννηθη` (from water and be born), linking the element directly to the act of generation. The scribe struggles under the weight of the revelation, writing `ειδειν ειϲελθειν ειϲελθιν` (to see to enter to enter)—a chaotic stumbling that reveals the urgency of the soul to find the door. It is not merely the Kingdom of God, but `των ουρα` (of the heavens), lifting our eyes from the earthly water to the celestial destination. The water is the womb; the birth is the entrance.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
το γεγεννη εκ τηϲ ϲαρ · ϲαρξʼ εϲτιν · και το γεγεννημεν εκ του π π · π εϲτ εϲτ ·

**English Translation**
That which is born of the flesh, flesh is; and that which is born of the Spirit Spirit, Spirit is is.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The distinction of natures is absolute. `ϲαρ` (flesh) produces only itself; it cannot transcend its own substance. But observe the manuscript's intensification: `εκ του π π` (of the Spirit Spirit). This doubling, and the answering `π εϲτ εϲτ` (Spirit is is), proclaims the superabundance of the Holy Spirit in the baptized. It is not merely a spirit, but the Spirit of Spirit, Life of Life, Being of Being. The repetition confirms the reality of the spiritual substance against the shadow of the flesh.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
μη θαυμαϲηϲ οτι ειπον ϲοι · δι ϋμαϲ γεννηθηναι ανω ·

**English Translation**
Do not marvel that I said to you: It is necessary for you to be born from above.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command `μη θαυμαϲηϲ` (do not marvel) checks the natural astonishment of the human mind. The word `δι` (it is necessary) lays a yoke upon all humanity; it is not a suggestion but an ontological requirement. `ανω` (from above) points to the source. We do not regenerate ourselves from within, but are reconstituted from without. The abbreviation of the command emphasizes its brevity and its inescapable force.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
το π · οπου θε πνι · και την φω αυτου ακου · αλλ ουκ οιδαϲ ποθεν ερχεται · και που ϋπαγει · ου εϲτιν παϲ ο γεγεννημενοϲ εκ του ϋδατοϲ και του π π ·

**English Translation**
The Spirit where it wills blows; and the sound of it [you] hear; but not you know from where it comes; and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the water and of the Spirit Spirit.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound mystery is preserved in this Codex! While others speak only of the Spirit here, this text declares `εκ του ϋδατοϲ και του π π` (of the water and of the Spirit Spirit). Even in the analogy of the wind, the water is present. The Spirit (`το π`) has a will (`θε`), and a voice (`φω`), yet its path is invisible to the uninitiated. The believer is defined by this dual source: the visible water and the invisible, double-emphasized Spirit (`π π`), making him as uncontainable and mysterious as the wind itself.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
απεκρι νικοδημοϲ και ειπεν αυτω · πωϲ δυναται ταυ γενεϲθαι ·

**English Translation**
Answered Nicodemus and said to him: How is able these things to happen?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Nicodemus is reduced to a single, helpless interrogative: `πωϲ` (how). The `ταυ` (these things)—the water, the Spirit, the birth from above—are beyond his rabbinic categories. He represents the exhaustion of the intellect when faced with the sacraments. He asks for a mechanism of becoming (`γενεϲθαι`), but grace operates not by mechanism but by divine fiat.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
απε ο και ειπ αυτω · ϲυ ει ο διδα του ι · και ταυτα ου γινω ·

**English Translation**
Answered the [Jesus] and said to him: You are the teacher of Israel; and these things not know?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The rebuke is sharp. He is `ο διδα` (the teacher), the articulate master of the Law, yet he stands ignorant of the Law's fulfillment. He is of `του ι` (Israel), the people of revelation, yet blind to the Revelation standing before him. `ου γινω` (not know)—his knowledge is negation. It serves as a warning to us bishops and scholars: office and title do not guarantee spiritual sight; only the Spirit teaches the things of the Spirit.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμ αμ λεγω ϲοι · οτι ο οι λαλουμ λαλουμ · και ο εωρακαμεν μαρτυρουμεν · και την μαρτυριαν η ου λαμβανε ·

**English Translation**
Amen Am Am I say to you: that what we know we speak we speak; and what we have seen we testify; and the testimony of us not you receive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord speaks with the plural of majesty or the consensus of the Trinity. The text stammers with divine fullness: `αμην αμ αμ` (Amen Am Am) and `λαλουμ λαλουμ` (we speak we speak). This is not error, but the overflowing of truth. We speak what we know—not what we speculate. The tragedy of the synagogue is in the final clause: `ου λαμβανε` (you receive not). The testimony is offered, doubled in its verbal confirmation, yet rejected by the heart of stone.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ει τα επιγια ειπ ειπ ϋμιν και ου πιϲτευ · πωϲ εαν ειπω ϋμιν τα επουρανι πιϲτευϲεται ·

**English Translation**
If the earthly things I said said to you and not you believe; how if I tell you the heavenly things will you believe?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord contrasts `τα επιγια` (the earthly things)—likely the parables of wind and birth—with `τα επουρανι` (the heavenly things), the eternal generation of the Son and the mysteries of the Godhead. The scribe repeats `ειπ ειπ` (said said), emphasizing the repeated efforts of God to communicate with man. If the mind stumbles at the water of baptism which is visible, how shall it grasp the fire of the divinity which is invisible? Faith (`πιϲτευ`) is the bridge, and without it, the ascent to the heavenly is impossible.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
και ουδειϲ αναβεβηκ αναβεβηκ ειϲ τον ουρανον . ει μη ο εκ του ουρανου καταβαϲ ο του ανθρωπου ˙

**English Translation**
And no one has ascended ascended into the heaven, except the [one] out of the heaven having come down, the [one] of the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe’s trembling hand, repeating *anabebēk anabebēk* ("ascended ascended"), as if the very thought of human flesh entering the Divine Counsel causes the pen to stutter in awe. We see here the exclusivity of the Lord’s domain. No patriarch, not even Moses, ascended by nature; only He who descends by nature can ascend by right. The text here calls Him *ho tou anthrōpou* ("the [one] of the man"), a humble, abbreviated title. It omits the word "Son," yet the relationship is undeniable. He is the offspring of the Virgin, the "One of the Man," who brings the clay of Adam back to the height from which the Word descended.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και καθωϲ μωϋϲηϲ ϋψωϲεν τον οφ οφ εν τη ερημω . ου ο ϋψωθηναι δι τον του α α ·

**English Translation**
And just as Moses lifted up the serp serp in the desert, [thus] to be lifted up is nec[essary] the [one] of the m m.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Again, the text stammers in the face of the mystery: *oph oph* ("serpent serpent"). Is this not the duality of the symbol? The serpent of sin that bit, and the bronze serpent that healed? The scribe writes *ton tou a a*—"the [one] of the m[an] m[an]" (or perhaps the Alpha Alpha). We discern through the broken letters the necessity (*dei*, here *di*) of the Passion. As the venom was drawn out by the image of the beast, so death is destroyed by the death of Him who took the form of a servant. The "m m" signifies the fullness of His humanity; He is truly Man, lifted up so that we might not look at our wounds, but at His cross.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα παϲ ο πιϲτευ ειϲ αυτον · εχη ζωην αιωνιον ·

**English Translation**
In order that every [one] the [one] believ[ing] into him, might have life eternal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The promise is universal: *pas* (every). The condition is specific: *pisteu* (believing)—though the word is cut short, the action of faith must be complete. Note the preposition *eis* (into). We do not merely believe *about* Him; we believe *into* Him, moving from our mortality into His substance. The result is *zōēn aiōnion*, the life of the ages, which belongs to the Uncreated.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
ουτωϲ γαρ ηγαπη ο τον κοϲμ κοϲμ · ωϲτε τον αυτου τον μονογενη εδωκεν ϊνα παϲ ο πιϲτευων ειϲ αυτον μη απο · αλλ εχη ζω αιωνιον

**English Translation**
For thus loved the [One] the worl world; so that the [Son] of him, the only-begotten, he gave, in order that every [one] the [one] believing into him not per[ish], but have li[fe] eternal.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Subject is simply *Ho* ("The [One]"). The Name of the Father is too great to be limited by ink, yet implied by the act of giving. He loved the *kosm kosm*—the repetition emphasizes the entirety of the created order, or perhaps the depth of the world's depravity which He sought to redeem. The verb *apo* (perish) is severed, as if the very idea of destruction is cut off by the presence of the *Monogenē* (Only-Begotten). We are offered *zō* (life), a fragment of the word standing for the endless reality of the Beatific Vision.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ου γαρ απεϲτιλεν ο τον ϋϊον ειϲ τον κοϲμον ϊνα κρι τον κοϲμον · αλλ ϊνα ϲωθη ο κο δι αυτου ·

**English Translation**
For sent not the [One] the Son into the world in order that he might jud[ge] the world; but in order that might be saved the wo[rld] through him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The purpose of the First Advent is distinct from the Second. The "One" (the Father) sent the Son not for *kri* (judgment/condemnation)—the word is halted, for the judgment is suspended by mercy. The goal is that the *ko* (world) be saved *di autou* (through Him). Salvation is not an abstract concept but a Person; the world is held together and rescued only through the agency of the Incarnate Word.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
ο πι ειϲ αυτον ου κρινεται · ο μη πιϲτευων · ηδη κεκριται · οτι μη πεπιϲτευκεν ειϲ το ονομα του μονο υϊου του ˙

**English Translation**
The belie[ver] into him is not judged; the [one] not believing, already has been judged; because he has not believed into the name of the on[ly] Son of the [One].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the dividing line. The *pi* (believer) is exempt from the terror of the tribunal. But the unbeliever carries his verdict within himself *ēdē* (already). Why? Because he has rejected the *Onoma* (Name). It is not merely a rejection of a teacher, but of the *Mono* (Only) Son of the *Tou* (The [Father]). To reject the Son is to be left without a mediator before the consuming fire of the Godhead.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
αυτη δε εϲτιν η κρι · οτι το φωϲ ε ειϲ τον κοϲμον · και οι αν ηγαπηϲ ηγαπηϲ το ϲκοτοϲ μαλλον η το φωϲ · ην γαρ αυ πονηρα τα ερ ·

**English Translation**
And this is the judg[ment]; that the light c[ame] into the world; and the m[en] loved loved the darkness rather than the light; for was of th[em] evil the wo[rks].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The *kri* (judgment) is defined by reaction to the Light. The Light *e* (came/was)—the letter epsilon stands as a witness to the Incarnation. But behold the tragedy: *ēgapēs ēgapēs* ("loved loved"). The duplication reveals the intensity of their perversion; they did not merely tolerate darkness, they courted it with a lover's passion. The cause is moral, not intellectual: their *er* (works) were evil. Sin clouds the eye of the soul, making the Light painful to endure.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
παϲ γαρ ο φαυλα πραϲϲων · μειϲει το φωϲ · κ(αι) ουκ ερχεται προϲ το φωϲ ϊνα μη ελεγ τα εργα αυτου

**English Translation**
For every [one] the [one] foul things practicing, hates the light, a(nd) comes not to the light in order that not reprov[ed] be the works of him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The practitioner of *phaula* (foul/worthless things) is driven by fear. He *meisei* (hates) the illumination. It is the instinct of the thief to avoid the dawn. He avoids the Light *hina mē eleg* (lest he be reproved/exposed). The sinner prefers the comfort of the shadow to the healing pain of exposure. Confession is the act of stepping into the Light, which the wicked soul refuses.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ποιων την αληθιαν ερχετα προϲ το φωϲ ϊνα φανερωθη τα εργα αυτου οτι εν εϲτιν ειρ ειργαϲμενα ειργαϲμενα ·

**English Translation**
But the [one] doing the truth comes to the light in order that might be made manifest the works of him that in [God?] it is wrought wrought wrought.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Truth is not just thought, it is done (*poiōn*). The righteous man rushes to the Light. Why? To show that his deeds are not his own. The text stammers in ecstasy: *eirgasmena eirgasmena* ("wrought wrought"). The works are done *en* (in)—the preposition hangs without a noun, implying "In the Ineffable." Good works are accomplished within the sphere of Divine Grace. The triple stutter of the scribe reflects the perfection of works done in the Trinity.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
μετα ταυτα ηλθεν ο ειϲ την ϊουδαιαν γην και οι μαθηται αυ · κακει διετριβ μετ αυτων · και εβα ·

**English Translation**
After these things came the [Lord] into the Judean land and the disciples of hi[m]; and there he tarried with them; and bap[tized].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The narrative descends from high theology to pastoral geography. *Ho* (The [Jesus]) comes to Judea. He *dietrib* (tarried/rubbed shoulders) with them. The Master spends time with the dust of the earth. And He *eba* (bap[tized]). Though the Evangelist later clarifies He baptized through His disciples, the act is attributed to Him as the source of all cleansing. The King enters the water to sanctify the element for our sake.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ην δε και βαπτι εν αινων ˙ εν του ϲαλειμʼ οτι ϋδατα πολλα ην ε · και παρεγειν παρεγειν και εβαπτιζον ·

**English Translation**
Was moreover also [John] baptiz[ing] in Aenon; near the Salim, because waters many was th[ere]; and they arrived arrived and were being baptized.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John the Forerunner continues his fading ministry at Aenon. Why? Because *hydata polla* (many waters) were there—a practical necessity for the crowds. The people *paregein paregein* ("arrived arrived")—the repetition captures the ceaseless flow of the multitude, hungry for repentance. Yet this baptism is but water; the Baptism of the Spirit awaits the glorification of the One mentioned in the previous verses.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ουπω γαρʼ ην βε ειϲ τ φυλακην ο ϊωαννηϲ ·

**English Translation**
For not yet was cas[t] into t[he] prison the John.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A grim chronological note. The voice of the wilderness has not yet been silenced by the walls of the dungeon (*phylakēn*). The verb *be* (short for *beblēmenos*, cast/thrown) anticipates the violence to come. The Light shines in Judea while the lamp of John still burns, but the shadow of Herod looms. The transition from the Prophet to the Messiah is nearing its completion.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
εγενετο δε ουν ϲυνζη ζητηϲιϲ εκ των μα ϊωαννου μετα ϊουδαιων ϊουδαιου πε καθαριϲμου ·

**English Translation**
There arose therefore a questioning from the [disciples] of John with Jews [a Jew] concerning purification.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribal agitation in the text (`ϲυνζη ζητηϲιϲ`), mirroring the earthly confusion of the disputants. The text wavers between a plural adversary (`ϊουδαιων`) and a singular one (`ϊουδαιου`), perhaps narrowing the accusation to a specific legalist. The debate concerns "purification" (`καθαριϲμου`), a sign that the Old Covenant's water jars are running dry. The disciples of the Forerunner, zealous but shortsighted, argue over rituals while the true Purification stands in their midst.

**Verse 26**

**Greek Text**
και ηλθον προϲ τον και ει αυτω · ραββει · ο ην μετα ϲου περ περ του ϊορδανου ὡϲ ὡ ὡ ϲυ μεμαρτυρηκαϲ · ϊδε ουτοϲ βαπτιζι και παντεϲ ερχον προϲ αυτον ˙

**English Translation**
And they came to [John] and said to him: Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan to whom thou hast borne witness, behold this one baptizes and all come to him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering of the scribe (`περ περ`, `ὡϲ ὡ ὡ`) captures the breathless envy of John's followers. They perceive the ministry of Jesus not as a fulfillment but as a usurpation. Their complaint, "all come to him" (`παντεϲ ερχον προϲ αυτον`), is a hyperbole born of jealousy. They wish to hoard the spiritual authority for their master, failing to understand that the river is meant to flow into the sea.

**Verse 27**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ϊωαννηϲ και ειπεν · ου δυναται ανθρωποϲ λαβιν ουδεν · εαν μη ῆ δε αυτω εκ του ουρανου ·

**English Translation**
John answered and said: A man cannot receive nothing [anything], unless it be [given] to him from heaven.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the antidote to envy: the recognition of divine sovereignty. The double negative (`ου... ουδεν`) emphasizes the utter impotence of human ambition. John confesses that his own role—and the rising glory of Jesus—is an ordinance `εκ του ουρανου` (from heaven). The abbreviated `ῆ δε` (standing for "be given") implies that all spiritual authority is a gift of grace, not a prize to be seized by men.

**Verse 28**

**Greek Text**
αυτοι ϋμιϲ μαρτυριται · οτι ειπον ουκ ει εγω ο · αλλ ο απεϲταλμενοϲ ειμι εμπροϲθεν εκεινου ·

**English Translation**
You yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the [Christ], but that I am the one sent before him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John defines his identity by negation. The cryptic `ο` likely stands for `ο χριστος` (the Christ), a title too heavy for the servant to bear. He is merely the `απεϲταλμενοϲ` (the sent one), positioned `εμπροϲθεν` (before) the King. To claim the title would be theft; to accept his station as the herald is his true dignity. He calls his own disciples to testify to his consistent humility.

**Verse 29**

**Greek Text**
ο εχων την νυμφην · νυμ εϲτιν · ο δε φι του νυμφιου ο εϲτηκωϲ αυτου και ακουων · χαρα χαιρει δια την φω του νυμφιου · αυτη ουν η χαρα η εμη πεπληρωται ·

**English Translation**
He having the bride is [bridegroom]; but the [friend] of the bridegroom, the one standing [by] him and hearing, with joy rejoices because of the [voice] of the bridegroom. This therefore my joy has been fulfilled.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Church is the Bride, and she belongs only to the `νυμ` (Bridegroom), Christ. John casts himself as the `φι` (friend), the `paranymphos` who arranges the union but does not partake in it. His joy is not in possession but in the `φω` (voice) of the Groom. The finality of `πεπληρωται` (has been fulfilled) marks the completion of the Old Dispensation; the friend steps back as the marriage feast begins.

**Verse 30**

**Greek Text**
εκεινον δει αυξα · εμε δε ελατ ·

**English Translation**
Him it behooves to [increase], but me to [decrease].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The theology of history is compressed into two abbreviated verbs: `αυξα` (to increase) and `ελατ` (to decrease). The necessity (`δει`) is absolute. As the Sun of Righteousness rises, the Morning Star must fade into the light of day. This is not John's defeat, but his consummation. The servant finds his true size only when the Master fills the horizon.

**Verse 31**

**Greek Text**
ο ανωθεν ερχομε επανω παν εϲτιν · ο δε επι εκ τηϲ γηϲ εκ τηϲ γηϲ εϲτιν · και εκ τηϲ γηϲ λαλει · ο εκ του ου ερχομενοϲ επανω παντων εϲτιν

**English Translation**
He coming from above is above [all]; but he [being] of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth speaks; he coming from [heaven] is above all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A sharp delineation between the earthly prophet and the Heavenly Word. The scribe writes `επι` (upon) where we expect `ων` (being), yet the contrast holds: the one of the earth is trapped in earthly speech. Christ, coming `εκ του ου` (from heaven), possesses a nature `επανω παντων` (above all). No amount of prophetic insight can equal the direct descent of the Son; origin dictates authority.

**Verse 32**

**Greek Text**
ον ο εωρακε εωρακεν και η ηκουϲεν μαρτυρει · και την μαρτυρι αυτου ουδιϲ λαμ ·

**English Translation**
What he has seen and [what] he heard, he testifies; and his [testimony] no one [receives].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Son speaks from the immediacy of vision (`εωρακεν`) in the Father's presence. The text stumbles (`ον ο`, `η`), yet conveys the tragedy of the Incarnation: the world is deaf to the eyewitness of God. `ουδιϲ λαμ` (no one receives) is a rhetorical lament; though the Light shines, the darkness comprehends it not. The rejection of the Son's testimony is the condemnation of the world.

**Verse 33**

**Greek Text**
ο λαβων αυτου την μαρτυ εϲφραγιϲεν · οτι ο αληθηϲ εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
He having received his [testimony] has set his seal that [God] is true.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To believe is to affix one's seal (`εϲφραγιϲεν`) to a legal document, attesting to its validity. By accepting Jesus, the believer vindicates the veracity of the Father (`ο` implying `ο θεος`). Faith is not merely an opinion; it is a juridical act in the court of heaven, declaring that God is no liar. The abbreviated `μαρτυ` (testimony) is the document we sign with our lives.

**Verse 34**

**Greek Text**
ον γαρ απε ο · τα ρη του λαλει · ου γαρ εκ μετρου διδωϲι το ·

**English Translation**
For whom [God] sent speaks the [words] of [God]; for not by measure gives he the [Spirit].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text is a sequence of holy ciphers (`ο`, `ρη`, `του`, `το`), stripping the verse to its divine skeleton. The Sent One utters the very `ρηματα` (words) of God. Unlike the prophets who received the Spirit in portions, the Son receives the Spirit (`το πνευμα`) without measure (`εκ μετρου`). The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily; the scribe's brevity paradoxically highlights the boundlessness of the gift.

**Verse 35**

**Greek Text**
ο πατηρ αγαπα τον και παντα δε εν τη χει αυτου ·

**English Translation**
The Father loves the [Son] and all things [has given] in his [hand].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The cosmic hierarchy is rooted in love (`αγαπα`). The Father has placed the totality of existence (`παντα`) into the `χει` (hand) of the Son (`τον`). The abbreviated `δε` (for `δεδωκεν`, has given) indicates a completed, irreversible transfer of power. To resist the Son is to resist the Architect of the universe, for all things are now under His jurisdiction.

**Verse 36**

**Greek Text**
ο πιϲτευ ειϲ τον εχει ζωην αιωνιον · ο δε απιθων τω υϊω ουκ εχει ζωην οψεται ζωην οψεται ζωην ˙ αλλ η οργη του επ αυτον μενει ·

**English Translation**
He [believing] into the [Son] has life eternal; but he disobeying the Son does not have life [will see life will see life]; but the wrath of [God] remains upon him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A terrifying conclusion marred by scribal confusion. The text asserts the disobedient (`απιθων`) "does not have life," then strangely stutters "will see life will see life" (`οψεται ζωην...`), perhaps a confused correction or a phantom of the eye. Yet the final clause is unambiguous: the `οργη του` (wrath of God) remains. There is no middle ground. One either possesses eternal life through faith or remains under the abiding weight of divine judgment.
