**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
μετα ταυτα ην η εορ των ϊουδαι ϊουδαι · και ανεβη ο ει ειϲ ϊεροϲολυμα ·

**English Translation**
After these things was the feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the rhythm of the Master's life, governed not by necessity but by obedience to the Law He Himself authored. The scribe's repetition of *ton Ioudai(on)* (of the Jews) emphasizes the specific covenantal context. He ascends to Jerusalem, the city of the Great King, showing us that true piety does not despise the appointed times and seasons of the sanctuary.


**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
εν εϲτιν δε εν τοιϲ ϊερο εν τη προβα κολυμβηθρα το λεγομενον η επιλεγομενη ε βηθζαθα πεντε ϲτοαϲ ε ·

**English Translation**
Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [place] a pool, the [one] surnamed in Hebrew Bethzatha, having five porches.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Codex reads *Bethzatha*—House of the Olive—rather than Bethesda. It stands by the sheep gate, where the sacrificial lambs enter, prefiguring the Lamb of God. The five porches signify the five books of Moses (the Law), which shelter the sick and reveal their infirmity but possess no power to heal them. The Law encloses the multitude, but Grace must enter to save.


**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
εν ταυταιϲ κατεκειτο πληθοϲ των αϲθενουντ αϲθενουντ τυφλων χωλων ξηρων ·

**English Translation**
In these lay a multitude of the ailing, blind, lame, withered.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the tableau of fallen humanity: blind to the truth, lame in the path of righteousness, withered in spiritual vitality. The scribe stammers, writing *asthenounton* (ailing) twice, as if overwhelmed by the sheer mass of human misery. Note well: this manuscript contains no mention of an angel troubling the water (Verse 4 is absent). We are thus forced to look away from created intermediaries and fix our eyes solely on the Creator who stands ready to heal.


**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
ην δε τιϲ ανθρωποϲ τριακοντα και ο ετη εχων τη αϲθενια αυτου ·

**English Translation**
And there was a certain man having thirty and eight years in his infirmity.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Thirty-eight years. This specific duration recalls the time Israel wandered in the wilderness from Kadesh-barnea until the generation of men of war was consumed (Deuteronomy 2:14). This man is a living symbol of Israel under the law—lingering in the wilderness of sickness, waiting for the true Joshua to grant him rest.


**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
τουτον ο ανακειμενον κατακειμενον · και γνουϲ οτι πο χρονον εχει · λεγει αυτω θελιϲ υγιηϲ γενεϲθαι ·

**English Translation**
Seeing this one lying down, and knowing that he has [spent] much time, He says to him: Do you will to become whole?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Omniscient Lord requires no report; He *knows* the time. Yet He asks, "Do you will?" ( *theleis* ). Prolonged suffering often breeds despair, a paralysis of the will worse than that of the limbs. The Physician demands the consent of the patient's will, awakening the soul before He restores the body.


**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
α αυτω ο αϲθενων · αν ουκ εχω · ϊνα οταν ταραχθη το ϋδωρ · βαλη με ειϲ την κολυμβηθρ κολυμβηθρ · εν ω δε ερχομαι ε · αλλοϲ προ ε καταβαινι ·

**English Translation**
The ailing [man] answered Him: Sir, I do not have a man, that when the water is troubled, he might cast me into the pool; but while I am coming, another goes down before me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"I have no man" (*anthropon ouk echo*). This is the cry of the desolate soul looking for salvation in human strength. He waits for the troubling of the water, unaware that the Peace of the world stands before him. He laments the lack of a man to push him in, while the God-Man has come to pull him out.


**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ο εγει αρον τον κραβα ϲου και πε

**English Translation**
Jesus says to him: Rise, take up thy bed and walk.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Three commands of power: *Egeire* (Rise)—resurrection from the death of inactivity; *Aron* (Take up)—demonstration of new strength; *Peripatei* (Walk)—perseverance in the way of life. The bed, which once bore the man as a burden, is now borne by the man as a trophy of grace.


**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) ευθεωϲ κ(αι) ευθεωϲ εγενετο ϋγιηϲ ο ανθρωποϲ και ηγερθη · και η · τον κραβακτ κραβαττ αυτου και περιε · ην δε ϲαβ εν εκινη τη ημερα ·

**English Translation**
And immediately the man became whole and rose; and he took up his bed and walked. Now it was Sabbath on that day.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The scribe writes "immediately" (*eutheos*) twice, stuttering in amazement at the suddenness of the miracle. There is no convalescence in divine healing. Yet, the text ominously notes, "It was Sabbath." The Rest-Giver is about to be accused of breaking the Rest Day, for the legalists understand neither the Father's work nor the Son's authority.


**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
ελεγον ουν οι ϊουδαιοι τω τεθεραπευμε · ϲαββατον εϲ · και ουκ εξεϲτ ϲοι αραι τον κρα κραβαττον ϲου ·

**English Translation**
Therefore the Jews were saying to the cured [man]: It is Sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the blindness of the letter. They see a man walking who has not walked for thirty-eight years, yet they see only the mat upon his shoulder. They guard the Sabbath but despise the Lord of the Sabbath. They prefer a paralyzed man keeping the ritual to a healed man glorifying God through action.


**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ο δε απεκρινατο απεκριθη αυτοιϲ · ο ποιηϲαϲ με ϋγι ϋγιη εκεινοϲ μοι ειπεν αραι αρον τον κραβακτον κραβαττον ϲου και περιπατειν περιπατει

**English Translation**
But he answered them: The One having made me whole, that One said to me: Take up thy bed and walk.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The logic of the healed man is unassailable. He who has the power to banish the infirmity has the authority to command the conduct. If His word can knit bones and sinews instantly, surely His command to carry the bed supersedes the rabbinic restrictions. The miracle validates the mandate.


**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
ηρωτηϲαν αυτ αυτ · τιϲ εϲτιν ο ανθρω ο ειπων ϲοι · αραι αρον και περιπατ περιπατι ·

**English Translation**
They asked him: Who is the man, the one saying to thee: Take up and walk?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Notice their malice. They do not ask, "Who is the man who healed thee?" They ask, "Who is the man who told thee to take up?" They ignore the work of mercy to hunt for the infraction of law. They seek a man to accuse, failing to recognize the Son of God who judges.


**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ο δε ϊαθειϲ ουκ η τιϲ εϲτιν · ο γαρ ενευϲεν εξενευϲεν οχλου οντοϲ εν τω με τοπω ·

**English Translation**
But the healed [man] knew not who it is; for Jesus slipped away, a crowd being in the place.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord *exeneusen*—He slipped out, or swam away, from the multitude. He seeks no earthly applause. The man possesses the gift of health but does not yet possess the knowledge of the Giver. The physical restoration is complete, but the revelation of Christ's identity awaits a second encounter in the Temple.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
μετα ταυτα ευ ο τον τεθε αυτον ο εν τω ϊερω και λεγει αυτω · ϊδε γε · μηκετι α · μη χειρον τι ϲοι γενη :

**English Translation**
After these things [he] finds... the [one]... him the [one] in the temple and says to him: See, [you have become well]; no longer [sin], lest something worse to you happen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the diligence of the Physician; He does not merely heal the body but seeks out the soul. The text reads *en tō hierō* (in the temple), indicating the man, once paralyzed, now walks to the house of God. The Lord’s command *mēketi a[martane]* (sin no longer) establishes a fearful link between the infirmity of the flesh and the errors of the soul. The "worse thing" warns of eternal judgment, which is far more grievous than thirty-eight years of earthly paralysis. Grace is not a license for negligence but a summons to holiness.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
απηλθεν ουν ο ανθρω και ειπεν τοιϲ ϊουδαιοιϲ · οτι ε ο ποιηϲαϲ αυ ϋγιη ·

**English Translation**
The man went away therefore and said to the Jews: that [it is Jesus] the [one] having made him well.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The man becomes a herald. He does not conceal the Benefactor, though he speaks to those who are hostile. The text abbreviates the name, yet the confession is clear: *ho poiēsas* (the one having made). He identifies the Lord not by His title, but by His work—making him *hygiē* (whole). It is the mark of a grateful soul to proclaim the Author of its restoration, even amidst a generation of vipers.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και δια τουτο εδιωκον οι ϊουδαιοι τον · ο ταυτα εποιει εν ϲαββατω :

**English Translation**
And because of this the Jews were persecuting the [Jesus]: [because] these things he was doing on a Sabbath.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the madness of legalism exposed. They do not marvel that a paralytic walks; they rage because the calendar was violated. The text says *ediōkon* (they were persecuting), showing a continuous hostility. They value the shadow of the Law over the Lord of the Law. By doing *tauta* (these things) on the Sabbath, the Savior demonstrates that doing good is the true rest of God, shaming those who rest only in idleness while their hearts are busy with murder.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
ο δε απεκρινετο αυτοιϲ · ο πατηρʼ μου εωϲ αρτι ερ καγω εργα ·

**English Translation**
But [he] answered them: The Father of me until now works, and I work.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A thunderbolt of theology. He does not defend Himself as a man breaking a rule, but as the Son sharing the nature of the Father. *Ho Patēr mou* (My Father) implies a unique relationship, distinct from ours by grace. If God ceased to work (providence and sustaining creation) on the Sabbath, the universe would collapse. *Kagō ergazomai* (and I work): He places His operation on the exact same level as the Father's. There is no interval between the Father's will and the Son's act.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
δια τουτο μαλλον εζητο αυτον οι ϊουδαι αποκτιναι · οτι ου μονον ελυε το ϲαββατον · αλλα και πατερα ϊδιον ελεγε τον · ϊϲ εαυτον ποιων τω

**English Translation**
Because of this more sought him the Jews to kill: because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but also [his] own Father he called the [God], equal himself making to the [God].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Jews understood what the heretics deny: the claim to Divinity. They sought to kill Him because He called God *idion* (His own, proper to Himself), not merely Father in a general sense. The text explicitly states *ison heauton poiōn* (making himself equal). This equality is not a usurpation but a revelation of nature. The enemies of Truth perceive the magnitude of the claim—that He is of the same substance (homousios) as the Father—and for this, they prepare the Cross.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
ελεγεν ο αυτοιϲ ο απεκρινατο ο ο κ(αι) ελεγεν αυτοιϲ αμην αμ λεγω ϋμιν ου δυ ο ποιειν αφ εαυτου ουδεν · αν μη τι βλεπη τον πατερα ποιουν · α γαρʼ αν εκεινοϲ ποιη · ταυτα και ο ποιει ομοιωϲ ·

**English Translation**
Said therefore to them the [Jesus]... answered the [Jesus]... and said to them: Amen am[en] I say to you, not able the [Son] to do from himself nothing, unless something he sees the Father doing; for whatever that one does, these things also the [Son] does likewise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He answers their accusation of independence (two Gods) by asserting unity of will. The Son can do nothing *aph' heautou* (from Himself) not because He is weak, but because He is inseparable from the Father. It is an impossibility of nature, not of power. The word *homoiōs* (likewise) signifies exactitude. It is not that the Father creates and the Son copies; rather, the operation is one. What the Father does, the Son does—the same act, the same power, the same dignity.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ο γαρ πατηρʼ φιλι τ τ και παντα δικνυ αυτω · α αυτοϲ ποιει και μιζονα τουτων εργα δει αυτω · ϊνα ϋμειϲ θαυμαζετε ·

**English Translation**
For the Father loves the [Son] and all things shows to him, which he himself does; and greater than these works he will show to him, in order that you may marvel.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The source of this unity is love (*philei*). The Father conceals nothing from the Son because the Son is the perfect Image of the Father. The "showing" is the communication of the Divine essence and power outside of time. The *meizona erga* (greater works) refer to what follows: the resurrection of the dead and the final judgment. He warns them: you marvel now at a healed paralytic, but you shall tremble before the Resurrector of the dead.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ γαρ ο πατηρʼ εγειρει τουϲ νεκρουϲ και ζωοποιει · ουτωϲ και ο ουϲ θελει ζωοποιει ·

**English Translation**
For as the Father raises the dead and makes alive, so also the [Son] whom he wills makes alive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the proof of equality: absolute sovereignty over life. He does not say "the Son asks the Father to make alive," but *ous thelei zōopoiei* (whom He wills, He makes alive). The power to give life belongs to God alone. By claiming this power resides in His own will (*thelei*), the Son declares Himself God. The parallelism is strict: "As the Father... So also the Son." There is no difference in the authority of the command.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
ουδε γαρ ο πατηρʼ κρινει ουδενα · αλλα τ κριϲιν παϲαν δε τω ϋϊω ·

**English Translation**
For neither does the Father judge anyone, but the judgment all has given to the Son.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Father judges through the Son. This does not strip the Father of authority but honors the Son as the visible agent of Divine Justice. Since the Son took on flesh and was judged by men, it is fitting that He returns as the Judge of men. *Krisin pasan* (all judgment) is committed to Him; therefore, no one can bypass the Son to appeal to the Father. To face the Judge is to face the Son.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ϊνα παντεϲ τιμω τον καθωϲ τιμωϲι τον πατε · ο μη τιμων τ · ου τειμα τον πατερα τον πεμ αυτον :

**English Translation**
In order that all may honor the [Son] just as they honor the Father. The [one] not honoring the [Son], does not honor the Father the [one having] sent him.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
This is the rule of worship. The honor (*timē*) given to the Son must be *kathōs* (just as) the honor given to the Father. Not a lower honor, not a secondary reverence, but the same adoration. He who dishonors the King's Image dishonors the King. The Jews claimed to honor the Father while rejecting Jesus; the Lord here declares their religion void. You cannot have the Father without the Son.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι ο τον λογ μου ακουων και πιϲτευων τω πεμ με εχει ζω αιωνιον · και ειϲ κριϲιν ουκ ερ · αλλα μετα εκ του θανατου ειϲ την ζωην :

**English Translation**
Amen amen I say to you that the [one] the word of me hearing and believing the [one] sent me has life eternal; and into judgment does not come, but has passed out of the death into the life.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the power of faith. It is not merely a future hope but a present possession: *echei zōēn aiōnion* (he has eternal life). The transition is immediate. The believer *metabebēken* (has passed over) already from the realm of spiritual death into life. He does not come into *krisin* (condemnation/judgment) because the judgment has already been satisfied in the acceptance of the Son. The Word of Christ is the bridge across the abyss of death.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϋμιν οτι ερχεται ωρα κ(αι) νυν εϲτιν οτε οι νεκροι ακουϲωϲι τηϲ φω του ϋϊου του · και οι ακουϲαν ζηϲουϲιν ·

**English Translation**
Amen amen I say to you that comes an hour and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of the [God]; and the [ones] having heard will live.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He speaks here of a two-fold resurrection. *Kai nyn estin* (and now is) refers to the spiritually dead—those dead in trespasses—who hear the Gospel and live. Yet it also anticipates the final trumpet. The power lies in *tēs phōnēs* (the voice). Just as He cried "Lazarus, come forth," His voice is the instrument of creation and regeneration. If the dead hear and live, how much more should the living hear and obey?

**Verse 26**
**Greek Text**
ωϲ ωϲπερ γαρ ο πατηρ ζω ζω εχει εν εαυτω ουτωϲ και τω υϊω εδωκεν ζωην εδωκεν εχιν εχιν εν εαυτω ουτωϲ και τω υϊω εδωκεν ζωην εχιν εν εαυτω

**English Translation**
For just as [as] the Father has li- life in himself, so also to the Son he gave life he gave to ha- have in himself; so also to the Son he gave life to have in himself.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the scribe's trembling hand, repeating the phrases "life" and "he gave" and "to have," and finally repeating the entire clause regarding the Son. While a mechanical error, let us read it spiritually: The generation of the Son is a mystery of abundance. The Father is the fountainhead, possessing Life (`ζωην`) inherently. The Son receives this not by measure, but fully, such that He too has it `εν εαυτω` (in Himself). The repetition emphasizes the certainty of this gift: the Son is not a vessel that can be emptied, but a source equal to the Father.

**Verse 27**
**Greek Text**
και κριϲιν εδωκεν αυτω εξουϲιαν εξουϲιαν εδωκεν αυτω κριϲιν ποιειν οτι αν εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
And judgment he gave to him authority, authority he gave to him judgment to execute, because he is Man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text here is tumultuous, placing "judgment" and "authority" in a circular dance. The reading `οτι αν εϲτιν` employs the *nomen sacrum* `αν` for *anthropos* (Man). Why is authority to judge given? Not merely because He is God, but specifically because He is Man. He who has worn the flesh is the only one fit to judge the flesh. The repetition of `εξουϲιαν` (authority) confirms that this power is absolute and transferred without diminution.

**Verse 28**
**Greek Text**
μη θαυμαζεται του οτι ερχεται ω · εν η παντεϲ οι εν τοιϲ μνημιοιϲ ακουϲωϲιν τηϲ φωνηϲ αυτου ·

**English Translation**
Do not marvel at th[is], that an h[our] is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear his voice;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The command `μη θαυμαζεται` (do not marvel) checks our awe at the present miracles (like the healing of the paralytic) because a greater terror approaches. The abbreviated `ω` signifies the *hora* (hour), the eschatological moment. The voice of the Son is so potent it penetrates the stone of the `μνημιοιϲ` (tombs). Even the dust obeys Him. This establishes His equality with the Creator who spoke existence from nothing; here, He speaks life from death.

**Verse 29**
**Greek Text**
κ(αι) εκπορευϲονται οι τα αγαθα ποιη ειϲ ανα ζωηϲ · οι δε τα φαυλα πραξ · ειϲ αναϲταϲιν κριϲεωϲ ·

**English Translation**
And they shall come forth; those who did good things to a res[urrection] of life, but those who prac[ticed] evil things to a resurrection of judgment.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the distinction in verbs abbreviated here: `ποιη` (doing/creating) for the good, suggesting a constructive alignment with God's will, versus `πραξ` (practicing/committing) for the evil, suggesting a habitual engagement with baseness. The result is a bifurcation of the resurrection (`ανα`): one leads to Life, the other to Crisis (`κριϲεωϲ`). There is no middle state; the grave vomits out all, but to different destinies.

**Verse 30**
**Greek Text**
ου δυνα ποιειν εγω απ εμαυτου ουδ ουδ · καθωϲ ακουω κρι κ(αι) κ(αι) η κριϲιϲ η εμη δικαια εϲτιν · οτι ου ζητω το θελη το εμον · αλλα το θελημα του πεμ με ·

**English Translation**
I am not ab[le] to do from myself noth- nothing; just as I hear I jud[ge], a- and my judgment is just; because I do not seek the wi- my own, but the will of the [one who] se[nt] me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The stuttering `ουδ ουδ` (nothing, nothing) reinforces the impossibility of the Son acting in isolation. This is not impotence, but the perfection of unity. His judgment (`κριϲιϲ`) is just precisely because it is devoid of private agenda (`το θελη το εμον`). In the Arian controversy, some claim the Son is inferior because He is "sent" (`πεμ`); we answer that His perfect alignment with the Sender's will proves His divine nature, for no creature can perfectly execute the will of the Infinite.

**Verse 31**
**Greek Text**
εαν ε μαρτυρω περι εμαυτου · η μαρ μου ουκ ε αληθηϲ ·

**English Translation**
If I testify concerning myself, my test[imony] is not true;

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Christ submits Himself to the Law of evidence. `εαν ε` (If I...) posits a hypothetical condition. If He were a solitary deity acting apart from the Father, His witness would be invalid (`ουκ... αληθηϲ`). He speaks here according to the human perception of legal truth: a man cannot validate himself. By admitting this, He prepares the way to introduce the Father as His co-witness.

**Verse 32**
**Greek Text**
αλ εϲτιν ο μαρ περι εμου και οιδαται οιδα · οτι α εϲτιν η μαρτυρια ην μαρ περι εμου ·

**English Translation**
Anoth[er] is the one testi[fying] concerning me, and ye kno- [I] know that tr[ue] is the testimony which he testi[fies] concerning me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text wavers between `οιδαται` (ye know) and `οιδα` (I know). The scribe's correction reveals a theological truth: The Jews *do not* truly know, but Christ *does* know. The "Another" (`αλ`) is the Father. Christ asserts the veracity (`α` for *alethes*) of the Father's witness. The Son's confidence in His own mission rests on the Father's eternal testimony, which is hidden from the crowd but known to the Son.

**Verse 33**
**Greek Text**
ϋμειϲ απεϲταλ προϲ ϊωαν και μεμαρ τη αληθι ·

**English Translation**
You have se[nt] to John, and he has testi[fied] to the tru[th].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He turns to a witness they can understand: John the Forerunner. `απεϲταλ` (you have sent) refers to the delegation of priests and Levites. John did not testify to himself, but to the `αληθι` (Truth). Christ uses John not because Christ needs him, but because the people required a human voice to point to the Divine Word.

**Verse 34**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε ου παρα ανθρωπου την μαρτυριαν λαμ · αλλα ταυτα λεγω ϊνα ϋμειϲ ϲωθητε ·

**English Translation**
But I do not rec[eive] testimony from man; but these things I say in order that you might be saved.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A crucial distinction: `ου... λαμ` (I do not receive/take). The Sun does not need a candle to prove it shines. Christ cites John solely for the sake of the listeners' salvation (`ϊνα ϋμειϲ ϲωθητε`). It is an act of condescension; He descends to the level of human testimony so that by believing the servant (John), they might eventually worship the Master.

**Verse 35**
**Greek Text**
εκεινοϲ ην ο λυχνοϲ ο καιομενοϲ και φαινων · ϋμιϲ δε ηθε αγαλλι προϲ ω εν τω φωτι αυτου ·

**English Translation**
That one was the lamp burning and shining; and you wi[lled] to rejoi[ce] for an h[our] in his light.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
John was the `λυχνοϲ` (lamp), not the Light (*phos*). A lamp must be kindled and consumes fuel; it is temporary. `καιομενοϲ` (burning) implies zeal and eventual consumption. The Jews' reaction was frivolous: `αγαλλι` (to exult/rejoice) but only `προϲ ω` (for an hour). They treated the prophet as a novelty rather than a call to repentance. They liked the heat but rejected the illumination.

**Verse 36**
**Greek Text**
εγω δε ε μαρτυριαν μειζω του ϊωαν · τα γαρ εργα · α δεδωκεν μοι ο πατηρ ϊνα τελιω αυτα · αυτα τα εργα α ποιω · μαρ περι εμου · ο ο πατηρʼ εμε με απε ·

**English Translation**
But I ha[ve] testimony greater than Jo[hn]; for the works which the Father has given me that I might fini[sh] them, these works which I do, testi[fy] concerning me that the Father has se- sent me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the superior witness: `τα εργα` (the works). The miracles—healing the sick, raising the dead—are the Father's credentials signed in power. The phrase `ϊνα τελιω` (that I might finish/perfect) shows the teleological nature of Christ's mission. The scribe's repetition `ο ο πατηρ εμε με απε` (that the Father me me sent) emphasizes the personal and direct commissioning. The Works are the voice of God made visible.

**Verse 37**
**Greek Text**
και ο πεμψαϲ με πατηρ · εκεινοϲ μεμαρ περι εμου · ουτε φωνην αυ πωποτε ακη · ουτε ειδοϲ αυτου εωρακατε ·

**English Translation**
And the Father who sent me, that one has testi[fied] concerning me. Neither his voice have you ever hea[rd], nor his form have you seen.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A devastating indictment. The Father has testified (perhaps at the Jordan), yet they are spiritually deaf (`ουτε φωνην... ακη`) and blind. They claim to be God's people, yet they have never perceived His `ειδοϲ` (form/shape). This refutes their claim to Moses, for even Moses saw only the back parts of God. Christ asserts that He alone is the revealer of the Father; without the Son, the Father remains utterly unperceived by humanity.

**Verse 38**

**Greek Text**
και τον λογον αυ ουκ εχετε εν ϋ μενοντα ˙ ο ον απεϲτιλεν εκινοϲ · τουτω ϋ ου πιϲτευετε ·

**English Translation**
And his word you do not have remaining in you; because whom that one sent, this one you do not believe.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the terrible diagnosis of the soul that rejects the Son. The Lord distinguishes between the possession of the Scripture and the indwelling of the *Logos*. One may hold the parchment yet lack the Word remaining (*menonta*) within the breast. The high point (˙) in the text creates a stark causality: the absence of the indwelling Word is proven by the rejection of the Sent One (*apestilen ekinos*). Faith in the Messenger is the only evidence that the Message has taken root. If you deny Him whom the Father sent, you prove the Father’s word is a stranger to your heart.

**Verse 39**

**Greek Text**
εραυνατε ταϲ γρα οτι δο εν αυταιϲ ζω αιωνιον εχ · και εκειναι ειϲ ειϲ αι μαρτυρουϲαι πε εμου ·

**English Translation**
You search the scriptures, because you think in them you have eternal life; and those are the ones testifying concerning me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great irony of the legalists. They search (*eraunate*)—a labor of diligence—yet they are blinded by the ink. They imagine (*dokeite*) that life resides in the letters themselves, rather than in the Subject to whom the letters point. The text presents a stutter in the divine witness, `ειϲ ειϲ` (*eisin*), emphasizing that these very scriptures *are* indeed the witnesses. Yet, one can possess the testimony and miss the Person. The Scriptures are the lamp, but Christ is the Light; woe to him who stares at the lamp and refuses the dawn.

**Verse 40**

**Greek Text**
και ου θε ελθειν προϲ με ϊνα ζωην εχη ·

**English Translation**
And you do not wish to come to me that you might have life.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The defect lies not in the intellect, but in the will (*ou thelete*—you do not will). It is not that they cannot find the path; it is that they refuse to walk it. Salvation is a movement: one must "come" (*elthein*) to the Person. They seek life in the dead letter (Verse 39), but refuse to approach the Living One. The tragedy of the human condition is encapsulated here: the offer of life is present, but the stubbornness of the will erects a wall against the Savior.

**Verse 41**

**Greek Text**
δοξαν παρα αν ου λαμ ·

**English Translation**
Glory from men I do not receive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord establishes His divine autarchy. He does not hunger for the applause of the Sanhedrin or the acclamation of the crowd. His glory is intrinsic, eternal, and begotten of the Father, not derived from the breath of mortals (*para anthrōpōn*). A bishop must learn this well: he who seeks the praise of his flock has already lost the ear of his Shepherd. Christ rejects human glory to teach us the poverty of earthly honor.

**Verse 42**

**Greek Text**
αλλ εγνωκα ϋμαϲ οτι ουκ εχε την αγαπην του ουκ εχετε εν ε ˙

**English Translation**
But I have known you, that you do not have the love of God... you do not have in [yourselves].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Great Physician peers into the chest and finds it hollow. He says "I have known you" (*egnōka*), a perfect knowledge that pierces every facade of piety. The text here is rugged, reflecting the brokenness of their condition: they lack the "love of God" (*agapēn tou [theou]*). It is not merely that they do not love God, but they do not possess the love *belonging* to God within them. The interior man (*en heautois*) is empty of divine charity, filled instead with self-love and pride.

**Verse 43**

**Greek Text**
εγω ελη εν τω ονο του πατροϲ μου · και ου λαμβα με · εαν αλλοϲ ελθη τω ονομα τω ϊδιω · εκει λημψεϲθαι ·

**English Translation**
I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, that one you will receive.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A prophecy of the Antichrist and all false prophets. Humility is rejected; arrogance is embraced. Because Christ comes in the Father's name, emptying Himself of self-will, the proud cannot stomach Him. But let a deceiver come in his *own* name (*tō idiō*), boasting of his own authority, and the world will run to him. Like attracts like; the proud receive the proud, but they crucify the Humble One.

**Verse 44**

**Greek Text**
πωϲ δυναϲθαι ϋμιϲ πιϲτευϲαι · δοξαν παρα αλλη λαμβανον · και την δοξ την παρα του μο ου ζητουν ζητιτε ·

**English Translation**
How are you able to believe, receiving glory from one another, and the glory from the only [God] you do not seek?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The impossibility of faith (*pōs dynasthe*) is rooted in the addiction to human praise. The spiritual eye is blinded by the flash of mutual flattery (*para allēlōn*). One cannot look horizontally for approval and vertically for truth at the same time. The text contrasts the "one another" with the "Only One" (*tou monou*). Until the soul ceases to trade in the currency of human reputation, it cannot purchase the pearl of great price. Faith requires a single eye fixed on the Single God.

**Verse 45**

**Greek Text**
μη δοκειται οτι εγω κατηγορη ϋμων προϲ τ π ˙ εϲτιν ο κατη ϋμων μω · ειϲ ον ϋμειϲ ηλ ·

**English Translation**
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one accusing you: Moses, in whom you have hoped.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ultimate reversal of the courtroom. The Jews clung to Moses as their advocate, but the Lord reveals him as their prosecutor (*katēgorōn*). The Law was given to lead to Christ; by stopping at the Law, they turn the Law into a judgment against themselves. He in whom they "have hoped" (*ēlpikate*) becomes the instrument of their condemnation. It is not Christ who needs to condemn them; their own misused scriptures already cry out against their unbelief.

**Verse 46**

**Greek Text**
ει γαρ επι μωϲει · ε αν εμοι · περι γαρ εμου εκει γεγραφεν εγραψεν ·

**English Translation**
For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for concerning me that one wrote.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
There is no schism between the Old Covenant and the New, only between the veil and the face. To truly believe Moses is to believe in the One he foretold. The scribe here preserves a double witness in the text, `γεγραφεν εγραψεν` (has written / wrote), as if to emphasize the indelible nature of the prophecy. Christ is the substance of the shadows cast by the Law. To reject the Substance is to prove one never understood the Shadow.

**Verse 47**

**Greek Text**
ει δε τοιϲ εκεινου γραμμαϲιν ου πι · πωϲ τοιϲ εμοιϲ ρημαϲιν πιϲτευϲετε πιϲτευϲεται ·

**English Translation**
But if in that one's writings you do not believe, how in my words will you believe?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The chapter concludes with a mournful logic. If they cannot hear God in the static, written letters (*grammasin*) of Moses which they revere, how shall they hear the living, spoken words (*rēmasin*) of the Son whom they despise? The written text was the tutor; the spoken word is the Master. Failing the lesson of the tutor renders the student deaf to the Master. The heart hardened against the Scripture is a heart hardened against the Word Incarnate.
