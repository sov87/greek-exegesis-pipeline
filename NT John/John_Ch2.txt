**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
και τη η τη τριτη · γα εγενετο εν κανα τηϲ γαλιλαι · και ηνʼ η μητηρ του εκει ·

**English Translation**
And on the... the third [day]... a wed[ding] happened in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of the [One] was there.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the stammering of the scribe, "on the... the third," as if trembling before the mystery. The "third day" is the sign of the Resurrection, for the wedding feast of the Lamb is the true joy that follows the Passion. It occurs in Cana of Galilee, signifying that the Gentiles, once far off, are now invited to the nuptials. The Mother is present as the root from which the Vine springs; she is there before the miracle, representing the faithful Israel awaiting the Bridegroom.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
εκλη δε και ο και οι μαθηται αυτου ειϲ τον γαμον ·

**English Translation**
And the [One] was called, and his disciples, to the wedding.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord accepts the invitation, sanctifying the bond of marriage which the heretics despise. He comes not alone, but with "disciples," showing that the solitary asceticism of the Baptist has given way to the communion of the Church. Where Christ is called, the company of the faithful follows.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
και ϋ οινου ελεϲθη ο οινοϲ του γαμου ειτα οι ουκ ειχον ο ϲυνετελεϲθη ο οινοϲ του γαμου ειτα ϋϲτερηϲαντοϲ οινου · ϋϲτερηϲαντοϲ οινου · λεγει η μητηρ του προϲ αυτον οινοϲ ουκ εϲτιν οινον ουκʼ εχουϲιν

**English Translation**
And [lacking] wine... the wine of the wedding was finished... then they did not have... the wine of the wedding was consummated... then wine having failed... wine having failed; the mother of the [One] says to him: Wine is not... they have no wine.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Look upon the tumult of the text! The scribe writes and rewrites the failure of the wine, mirroring the confusion of the feast. "Finished," "consummated," "failed"—so too has the Old Covenant run dry. The Law offers no more intoxication of the Spirit; the letter kills, and the cup is empty. The Mother, seeing the poverty of the old ritual, intercedes. She does not command, but exposes the need: "They have no wine." It is the cry of humanity waiting for grace.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
κ(αι) λεγει αυτη ο · τι ε και ϲοι γυναι · ουπω ηκει η ωρα μου

**English Translation**
A(nd) the [One] says to her: What is it to me and to you, Woman? My hour has not yet come.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He calls her "Woman," not out of disrespect, but to identify her as the New Eve. As the first woman led Adam to the tree of death, this Woman leads the New Adam to the tree of life. "What to me and to you?"—He distinguishes his divine nature, which works miracles, from the human nature he took from her. His "hour" is the Passion, where the true wine of his Blood shall be poured out; this miracle is but a foretaste.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
λεγει η μητηρʼ αυτου τοιϲ διακονοιϲ · οτι ο αν λεγη ϋμ ϋμ ποιηϲατε ˙

**English Translation**
His mother says to the servants: Whatever he says to you... to you, do.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the supreme rule of the Church: "Whatever he says... do." The repetition "to you, to you" in the manuscript emphasizes the urgency of obedience. The servants (deacons) represent the ministry of the Church. The Mother withdraws, leaving the servants face to face with the Word. Obedience is the vessel into which the miracle flows.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
ηϲαν δε εκει · λιθιναι ϋ εξʼ κατα τον κα των ϊ κιμεναι χωρου ανα μετρηταϲ δυο · η τρειϲ ·

**English Translation**
Now there were there stone [water-jars] six, according to the [purification] of the [Jews] set there, holding up to measures two or three.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"Stone" signifies the hardness of the Law written on tablets. "Six" is the number of imperfection, falling short of the Sabbath rest of seven. They stand for "purification," yet they are empty of spirit. They hold "two or three" measures—perhaps signifying the two covenants or the three persons of the Trinity, waiting to be revealed in the water of baptism.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
και λε αυτοιϲ ο · γε ταϲ ϋδριαϲ ϋδατοϲ · και εγεμι αυταϲ εωϲ α ·

**English Translation**
And the [One] says to them: Fill the water-jars with water. And they filled them up to the [brim].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He commands them to fill the jars, for Christ came not to abolish the Law but to fulfill it. The water is the literal meaning of Scripture. The servants fill them "up to the brim"—nothing of the Law is left empty or unfulfilled. The fullness of the old prepares the way for the transformation into the new.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
και λεγει αυ αντληϲατε νυν · και φερετε τω αρχιτρικλινω · οι δε ηνεγκαν

**English Translation**
And he says to [them]: Draw out now, and bear to the chief steward. And they bore [it].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
"Draw out now." The moment of change is in the act of faith. The water becomes wine in the drawing. It is borne to the "chief steward," who represents the teachers of the Old Law or the rulers of this age, who judge by taste but know not the source of power.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ δε εγευϲατο ο αρχι αρχιτρικλινοϲ το υδωρ οινον γεγενημε · και ουκ ηδει ποθεν εϲτιν · οι δε διακονοι η · οι ηντλη το ϋδωρ · φωνει τον νυμφι ο αρχιτρικλι

**English Translation**
But when the chief... chief steward tasted the water having become wine, and knew not whence it is (but the servants [knew], those having drawn the water), the chief stew[ard] calls the bride[groom].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The ruler tastes the effect but is ignorant of the cause. The world enjoys the blessings of God—life, rain, sun—but knows not the Creator. Only the "servants who had drawn the water" know. Knowledge of the mysteries belongs to the humble who labor in the Lord's vineyard, not to those who sit at the head of the table. The water has "become wine," just as the water of baptism becomes the fire of the Spirit.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
και λεγει · παϲ ανθρωποϲ πρω τον καλον οι τιθηϲιν · και οταν μεθυϲθωϲ τοτε τον ελαϲϲω · ϲυ δε τετηρηκαϲ τον κα οινον εωϲ αρ ·

**English Translation**
And says: Every man first sets the good wine, and when they be drunk, then the lesser; but you have kept the good wine until [now].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The way of the world is to offer the best pleasures first—youth and sin—which quickly turn to bitterness and dregs. But God's way is contrary: He keeps the "good wine" until the end. The Law was the lesser wine; the Gospel is the good wine, kept "until now," the fullness of time. The Bridegroom is Christ, who provides what the law could not.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ταυτην εποι την αρχην των ϲημιων ο εν κανα τηϲ γαλι πρωτην και εφανερωϲεν τ δοξαν αυτου και επιϲτευ οι μαθηται αυτου ειϲ αυτον ειϲ αυτον οι μαθηται αυτου

**English Translation**
This [Jesus] did [as] the beginning of signs in Cana of Gali[lee] [the] first, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him... in him his disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
It is called a "sign" (*semeion*), not merely a wonder, for it points toward his divinity. By changing the elements, he shows he is the Lord of Nature. He "manifested his glory"—the glory hidden in flesh flashes forth. The text stammers again in joy: "believed in him... in him his disciples." This repetition seals the faith of the new community. They believe not just because of the wine, but because they see the Glory.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
μετα τουτο κατε ειϲ καφαρναουμ αυτοϲ · και η μητηρ αυτου · και οι αδελ αυτου · και εκει εμιναν · ου πολ ημεραϲ :

**English Translation**
After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his broth[ers]; and there they remained not many days.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He descends from the feast to the city of consolation (Capernaum). His "brothers" are with him—kinsmen according to the flesh, distinct from the disciples of the spirit. They remain "not many days," for the Lord is a pilgrim, and the Passover draws near. He rests briefly before the zeal of the Father's house consumes him.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
εγγυϲ δε ην το παϲ των και ανεβη ϊϲ ϊεροϲο ο

**English Translation**
And near was the Pas[cha] of the [Jews], and Jesus went up to Jerusalem...

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We observe here the sacred economy of time and place. The text reads *to pas* (το παϲ), abbreviating the Pascha, the feast of passing over, which was "near." The genitive article *ton* (των) hangs without its nation, yet we know it refers to the old covenant people. The Lord, marked by the Nomina Sacra *IC* (Jesus), ascends. He goes up to *Hieroso* (Jerusalem), the city of the sanctuary. The final *o* stands as a fragment, perhaps the beginning of a definite article for the temple or the start of the next thought, reminding us that the ascent to Jerusalem is unfinished until the Passion is complete.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
και ευρ ευρ εν τω ϊερω τουϲ πωλουνταϲ και τα προβατα και βοαϲ βοαϲ και προβατα · και περιϲτεραϲ · και τουϲ κερματιϲταϲ καθημενουϲ

**English Translation**
And found found in the temple those selling and the sheep and oxen oxen and sheep; and doves; and the money-changers sitting.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript here bears the weight of emphasis through repetition, whether by scribal hand or divine intent. *Heuren heuren* ("found found") suggests a discovery that cannot be ignored; the Lord's eyes see clearly the desecration. The text lists the merchandise chaotically: *probata* (sheep) and *boas boas* (oxen oxen) and *probata* again. The sacrificial animals have crowded the house of prayer. The *kermatistas* (money-changers) are *kathemenous* (sitting)—a posture of permanence and possession in a place where they should not be. The disorder of the text mirrors the disorder of the Temple courts.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
ε κ(αι) ποιηϲαϲ φραγελ εκ ϲχοινι και πανταϲ ε εκ του ϊε τα κ(αι) κ(αι) προβατα και τουϲ βοαϲ · και τ κολλυβιϲτων ε το κερμα · και ταϲ τραπεζαϲ κατεϲτρεψεν ·

**English Translation**
...and having made a whip out of cords, and all ... out of the temple both the sheep and the oxen; and of the money-changers ... the coin; and the tables he overturned.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord acts with physical authority. *Poiesas phragel*—having made a whip (from the Latin *flagellum*) out of rushes (*schoinia*). He drives them *ek tou hie* (out of the temple), the abbreviation *hie* standing for the holy precinct (*hierou*). The text is fragmented (*e*, *ta k(ai)*), yet the violence of the cleansing is clear: the *kerma* (coin) is poured out, and the *trapezas* (tables) are overturned (*katestrepsen*). He disrupts the economy of man to restore the economy of God.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
και τοιϲ ταϲ περιϲτε πωλουϲιν ει · αρατε ταυτα εντευθεν · μη ποι τον οικον του πατροϲ μου οι εμποριου ·

**English Translation**
And to those selling the doves he said: Take these things hence; do not make the house of my Father a house of trade.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
To the sellers of *periste* (doves), the offering of the poor, He speaks a command: *Arate* (Take them away). The distinction is sharp: *oikon tou patros mou* (the house of my Father) must not become an *oikon emporiou* (house of trade/merchandise). He claims Sonship here, calling God His own Father, distinguishing the sacred dwelling from the marketplace. The purity of the shrine is rooted in the paternity of God.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
εμνηϲθηϲαν οι μαθηται αυτου ο γεγραμμενον εϲτιν · ο ζηλοϲ του οικου ϲου καταφα με ·

**English Translation**
His disciples remembered that it is written: The zeal of your house will consume me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Memory (*emnesthesan*) serves as the bridge between the event and the prophecy. The disciples recall the Psalm. *O zelos* (the zeal) for the house of God does not merely burn; it *katapha* (consumes/eats up) Him. This verb anticipates the Lord's total self-offering. The zeal for the Father's house will lead Him to the cross, where He is consumed for the life of the world.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθηϲαν ο οι ϊουδαιοι και ει αυτω · τι ϲημι δικνυειϲ ημ · οτι ταυτα ποιειϲ :

**English Translation**
The Jews therefore answered and said to him: What sign do you show us, that you do these things?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The adversaries, *hoi Ioudaioi*, demand a warrant for His authority. They ask for a *semi* (sign/miracle), abbreviated here. *Diknyeis* (you show) implies a demand for visual proof. They see the disruption of their trade but fail to see the Sign standing before them. They demand justification for the cleansing, unaware that the Cleanser is the Lord of the Temple.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
απεκριθη ο και ειπεν αυτοιϲ λυ τον ναον του και εν τριϲιν ημεραιϲ εγερω αυ ·

**English Translation**
Jesus answered and said to them: Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the great mystery. *Ly* (Destroy/Dissolve)—an imperative of challenge. He speaks of *ton naon* (the sanctuary/shrine), distinct from the general temple courts (*hieron*). *En trisin hemerais* (in three days) He will raise it (*egero*). The text abbreviates the object *au* (it/him). He prophesies the resurrection, substituting the stone sanctuary with the sanctuary of His flesh.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
ειπον ουν οι τεϲϲερα και εξʼ ετεϲ · οικοδομηθη ο ναοϲ ουτοϲ · και ϲυ τριϲιν ημεραιϲ εγε αυτον ·

**English Translation**
Therefore [the Jews] said: Forty and six years this temple was built; and you in three days will raise it?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The carnal mind cannot comprehend the spiritual architecture. They cite the chronology of stones: *tessera kai hex etes* (forty and six years). They look at the *naos outos* (this temple) of Herodian masonry. They mock the claim: "And you, in three days, will raise (*ege*) it?" They measure the omnipotence of the Logos against the labor of masons and find the former wanting.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
εκεινοϲ δε ελεγεν περι του ναου του ϲωμα αυτου ·

**English Translation**
But that one spoke concerning the temple of his body.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Evangelist clarifies the riddle. *Ekeinos* (That one/He) spoke not of stones, but *peri tou naou tou soma autou* (concerning the temple of his body). The body of Christ is the true Naos, the place where God dwells and where the true sacrifice is offered. The stone temple is but a shadow; the Body is the substance.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
οτε ουν ηγερ εκ νεκρων · ε οι μαθηται αυτου ο τουτο ελεγεν · και επιϲτευϲαν τη γραφη · και τω λογω ον ειπεν ο ·

**English Translation**
When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples [remembered] that he said this; and they believed the scripture; and the word which Jesus said.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Understanding follows the Resurrection (*eger*). Only after He is raised do the disciples remember (*e*—abbreviated form of *emnesthesan*). Faith (*episteusan*) is the fruit of this memory, binding together *te graphe* (the Scripture) and *to logo* (the word) spoken by Jesus. The written Law and the spoken Word of the Lord are unified in the event of the Resurrection.

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ δε ην εν τοιϲ ϊεροϲολυμοιϲ · εν τω παϲχα εν τη εορτη · πολλοι ε ειϲ το ονομα αυτου · θε αυτου τα ϲημια · α εποιει ·

**English Translation**
Now as he was in Jerusalem, in the Pascha at the feast, many [believed] into his name, beholding his signs which he did.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
While in *Hierosolymois* (Jerusalem) during the feast, a crowd gathers. *Polloi* (many) *e* (believed—*episteusan*) into His name. The cause of this faith is visual: *the* (beholding—*theorountes*) the *semia* (signs). Yet, this faith, born of seeing miracles rather than understanding the mystery of the Body, is fragile.

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
αυτοϲ δε ο ϊ ϊ ουκ επι αυτον εαυτον αυ · δια το γιγνω πανταϲ ·

**English Translation**
But Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them, because of knowing all.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A profound caution. The text repeats the Nomina Sacra: *ho I(sou)s I(sou)s* (Jesus Jesus), emphasizing His person. He did not *epi* (entrust/believe) Himself to them. Why? *Dia to gigno* (because of knowing) all men. The Lord, who searches the hearts, knows the fickleness of a faith based solely on signs. He knows the nature of man, for He formed him, yet He does not trust the instability of the crowd.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**

και οτι χριαν ουκ ειχ · ϊνα τιϲ μαρτυρη περι του ανθρω · αυτοϲ γαρ εγι τι ην εν τι ην εν τι ην εν τι ην εν τω ανθρω πω ·

**English Translation**

And because need he had not that anyone should testify concerning the man; for he himself knew what was in, what was in, what was in, what was in the man.

**Episcopal Exegesis**

Here we confront the absolute, unmediated knowledge of the Logos. The text presents the abbreviated *χριαν ουκ ειχ* (he had no need), stripping away the necessity of human testimony to inform the Divine Mind. The abbreviation *ανθρω* (for *anthropou*) signals the universal nature of humanity under scrutiny; Christ does not merely know a specific man, but the very essence of the "anthropos."

Observe the peculiar reading of the manuscript here, where the phrase *τι ην εν* (what was in) is repeated four times before concluding with *τω ανθρω πω*. While a lesser scribe might call this a mere error of the hand, a dittography of the quill, let us, with spiritual eyes, perceive the emphasis it creates. The human heart is not a shallow vessel but a labyrinth of depths—layer upon layer of intent, desire, sin, and spirit. By reading "what was in, what was in, what was in, what was in," we are forced to descend through these strata. Christ knows not only the surface thought but the motive beneath the thought, and the spirit beneath the motive, and the nature beneath the spirit.

The verb *εγι* (abbreviated from *eginosken*) denotes a continuous, inherent knowing. He did not come to know by investigation; He *was knowing*. The separation of *ανθρω* and *πω* at the end seals the creature in its entirety. Man is an open book to his Author, and no witness is required to interpret the pages of the soul to the One who wrote them.
