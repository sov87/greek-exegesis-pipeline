**Verse 1**

**Greek Text**
μετα ταυτα εφανε παλιν εαυ ο τοιϲ μαθη · επι τηϲ θαλαϲ τηϲ τιβεριαδοϲ · εφανερωϲεν δε ουτωϲ ·

**English Translation**
After these things, [He] manifested Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and He manifested [Himself] thus.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the brevity of the scribe; the Holy Name is implied by the article (*ο*), for the Lord is the Subject of all existence. The text reads *ephane* (manifested), a truncated form suggesting the suddenness of His appearing. He shows Himself *epi tēs thalas* (upon the sea); as He walked upon the waters before, now He stands as Master over the chaotic abyss of the world, here named Tiberias, signifying the Gentile nations.

**Verse 2**

**Greek Text**
ηϲαν ομου ϲιμων πετροϲ και θωμαϲ ο λεγομε διδυμοϲ · και ναθαναηλ · ο απο κανα τηϲ γαλιλαι · και οι ϋϊοι ζεβε · και αλλοι εκ των μαθητων αυ δυο :

**English Translation**
There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, the one called Didymus; and Nathanael, the one from Cana of Galilee; and the sons of Zebe[dee]; and two others of His disciples.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The sacred assembly is gathered *homou* (together). The scribe lists them with precision: Peter the Rock, Thomas the Twin (whose doubt is now healed), and Nathanael of Cana—reminding us of the first sign of water turned to wine. The "sons of Zebe" (Zebedee) are mentioned but not named, perhaps to humble their thunderous ambition. The seven are present, a number of perfection and completion in the Church's labor.

**Verse 3**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτοιϲ ϲιμ πετροϲ · α · λεγουϲιν αυτω ˙ ερχομεθα κ(αι) ημειϲ ϲυν ϲοι · εξηλ ουν και ενε ειϲ το πλοι · και εν εκινη τη νυκτι εκοπιαϲαν επιαϲαν επιαϲαν ουδεν ·

**English Translation**
Sim[on] Peter says to them: [I go]. They say to him: We also come with thee. They went out therefore and entered into the boat; and in that night they toiled, they caught, they caught nothing.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter’s utterance is reduced to a single letter *alpha* (`α`) in this codex, likely an abbreviation for *alieuein* (to fish) or *aperchomai* (I go away). It signifies the impulse of the will. The scribe here inserts *ekopiasan* (they toiled), a word of heavy labor found in Luke’s Gospel, and repeats *epiasan* (they caught) twice, emphasizing the futility of human effort. They caught, and caught again, yet held nothing—vacuity without the Logos.

**Verse 4**

**Greek Text**
πρωϊαϲ δε ηδη γενομενηϲ εϲτη επι τον αιγιαλον · ου μεντοι εγνω οι μαθηται ο εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
But morning having already come, [He] stood upon the beach; however, the disciples did not know that it is [He].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Darkness flees before the *prōias* (early morning), a figure of the Resurrection. He stands on the *aigialon* (beach), the solid ground of eternity, while the disciples remain tossing on the fluid waves of time. Their ignorance (*ou mentoi egnō*) persists; the eye of the flesh cannot discern the Risen Body until faith is kindled.

**Verse 5**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ουν αυτοιϲ ˙ παιδια · μη τι προϲ εχετε · απε αυτω ˙ ου ˙

**English Translation**
[He] says therefore to them: Children, do you not have anything to eat? They answered Him: No.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
He calls them *paidia* (children/infants), stripping them of their titles to reveal their spiritual infancy. The question implies a negative answer, forcing them to confess their poverty. The "No" (*ou*) is the necessary confession of man's emptiness before he can be filled by Divine Grace.

**Verse 6**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ο δε ειπεν λεγει αυτοιϲ · βαλε ειϲ τα δεξια με του πλοιου το δικτυον · και ευρη οι δε ειπον δι οληϲ τηϲ νυκτοϲ ε και ουδεν ελαβομεν επι δε τω ϲω ρηματι βαλουμεν οι δε εβαλον εβαλον ουν και ουκετι αυτο ϊλ ϊϲχυον απο του πληθουϲ των ϊχθυων ·

**English Translation**
He says [but He said He says] to them: Cast the net to the right parts of the boat, and you will find. But they said: Through the whole night [we labored] and took nothing; but at Thy word we will cast. They cast therefore [they cast], and no longer were they strong [enough to draw] it from the multitude of the fishes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A marvelous mystery in the text! The scribe here weaves the words of Simon from the first miraculous catch (Luke 5:5) into this final scene: "Through the whole night... but at Thy word." The text stammers with *legei o de eipen legei* (He says but He said He says), as if the weight of the tradition presses upon the pen. The obedience to the *rhēmati* (word) transforms the barren night into a multitude (*plēthous*) of life.

**Verse 7**

**Greek Text**
λεγει ο ο μαθητηϲ εκει · ον ηγαπα ο τω πετρω · ο εϲτ εϲτ · ϲιμων ουν πετροϲ ακουϲαϲ οτι ο εϲτιν · τον επενδυ διεζωϲατο · ην γαρ γυμνοϲ · κ(αι) εβαλεν εαυτον ειϲ την θαλαϲϲαν ·

**English Translation**
That disciple therefore says, whom [the Lord] loved, to Peter: It is [the Lord], it is. Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it is [the Lord], girded on his outer garment—for he was naked—and cast himself into the sea.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Love sees; Faith acts. The Beloved Disciple perceives the identity, crying out with a double affirmation in this codex: *o est est* (It is, it is!). Peter, in his fervor, covers his nakedness—reversing the shame of Adam—to approach the New Adam. He casts himself into the sea, a baptism of desire to be with the Master.

**Verse 8**

**Greek Text**
οι δε αλλοι μαθηται τω αλλω πλοιαρι ηλθον · ου γαρ η μακραν απο τηϲ γηϲ · αλλα ωϲ α πηχων διακο · ϲυροντεϲ το δικτυον των ϊχθυ

**English Translation**
But the other disciples came in the other little boat—for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off—dragging the net of fishes.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Church moves together; while one plunges in zeal, the others labor in the *ploiariō* (little boat), maintaining the structure of the ministry. They drag the net, not breaking it. The distance is two hundred cubits, a number signifying the twofold love (of God and neighbor) required to bring the catch to the shore.

**Verse 9**

**Greek Text**
ωϲ ουν ανε απεβηϲαν ειϲ επι ειϲ την γην · βλεπουϲιν ανθρα κειμενην · και οψαριον επικει · και αρτον ·

**English Translation**
As therefore they went up [disembarked] onto the land, they see a charcoal fire lying, and a fish lying upon [it], and bread.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Behold the prevenient grace! Before they offer their catch, the Lord has already provided. The *anthrakian* (charcoal fire) recalls the fire in the courtyard where Peter denied Him; here, it is a fire of restoration. The fish and bread are the Eucharistic symbols, prepared by Christ Himself for the weary laborers.

**Verse 10**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτοιϲ ο · ε απο τ τ οψαριων ων επι νυν :

**English Translation**
[He] says to them: Bring from the fishes which you caught now.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Though He needs nothing, He commands them to bring of their own catch. He desires that our labor be joined to His grace. The text stammers again (*apo t t*), perhaps trembling at the mystery of this exchange where the Creator asks a gift of the creature.

**Verse 11**

**Greek Text**
ενεβη ουν ϲιμων πετροϲ · και ειλκυ το δικτυον ειϲ την γην · μεϲτ ϊχθυων μεγαλ εκατον πεντηκ · και τοϲου οντων · ου εϲχιϲθη το δι ·

**English Translation**
Simon Peter therefore went up and drew the net to the land, full of large fishes, a hundred fifty; and being so many, the net was not rent.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter draws the net to land, fulfilling his role as the fisher of men. The codex reads *hekaton pentēk* (hundred fifty), omitting the "three" found in other copies. We contemplate the mystery of the numbers: the Law (10) multiplied by the Spirit (5) and the Trinity (3), though here the scribe rests on the round number of fullness. Despite the burden, the net (*diktyon*) is not torn; the unity of the Elect is preserved by the power of the Resurrection.

**Verse 12**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτοιϲ ο · δευτε αριϲτη · ουδιϲ δε ετολ των μαθητ εξεταϲαι αυτον · ϲυ τιϲ ει · ειδοτεϲ οτι ο εϲτιν ·

**English Translation**
[He] says to them: Come, eat breakfast. But no one of the disciples dared to ask Him: Who art Thou? Knowing that it is the Lord.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The invitation *deute aristēsate* (come, break fast) ends the long night of fasting. A holy fear silences the tongue; they do not ask "Who art Thou?" because the heart knows what the eyes struggle to comprehend. It is the *Kyrios* (Lord), known not by outward form, but by the power of His presence and the breaking of bread.

**Verse 13**

**Greek Text**
ερχε ο και λαμβα τον αρτον και διδωϲιν αυτοιϲ · κ(αι) το οψαριον ομοι

**English Translation**
Comes the [One] and takes the bread and gives to them; and the fish likewise.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Observe the sacred silence of this meal. The scribe has abbreviated the Holy Name, leaving only the article and the action: "Comes the [One]." It is the Lord acting as the High Priest of the new creation. He "takes" (*lamba*) and "gives," echoing the mystagogy of the Upper Room and the miracle of the loaves. Here, the fish—symbol of the believer caught in the net of the Church—is served alongside the bread of life. He feeds those who will feed the world.

**Verse 14**

**Greek Text**
τουτο δε ηδη τριτον εφανερω ο τοιϲ μαθη · εγερθειϲ εκ νεκρων ˙

**English Translation**
This now [was the] third [time] appeared the [Jesus] to the disciples; having been raised from the dead.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text emphasizes "third" (*triton*), sealing the testimony with a Trinitarian perfection. The manifestation is not a ghost, for the text explicitly grounds the vision in the dogma: "having been raised from the dead." The Resurrection is the lens through which the disciples now see Him; He is no longer merely the Teacher of Galilee, but the Risen Lord of Glory.

**Verse 15**

**Greek Text**
οτε ουν ηριϲτηϲαν ˙ λεγει τω ϲιμωνι πετρω ο · ϲιμων ϊωανου ϊωανου αγαπαϲ με πλεον τουτ · λεγει αυτω · ναι · ϲυ οιδαϲ οτι φιλω ϲε · λεγει αυ βοϲκε τα αρνι μου ·

**English Translation**
When therefore they had dined, says to Simon Peter the [Jesus]: Simon of John, of John, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him: Yes; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him: Feed my lambs.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Mark the scribal repetition "of John, of John" (*Ioanou Ioanou*); it is as if the Lord calls him from the very depths of his lineage to a new paternity. The Lord asks for *agape* (divine charity), "more than these" nets and boats. Peter, humbled by his fall, dares only offer *philia* (brotherly affection), saying "thou knowest that I love thee." The Lord accepts this humility and commands him to feed the "lambs"—the tender, new souls of the flock who need milk before meat.

**Verse 16**

**Greek Text**
παλιν λε αυτω το το ϲιμων ϊωαννου · αγαπαϲ με λεγει αυτω ναι · ϲυ οιδαϲ οτι φιλω ϲε · λεγει αυ ποιμαινε τα προβατα μου ·

**English Translation**
Again he says to him the [second time]: Simon of John, lovest thou me? He says to him: Yes; thou knowest that I love thee. He says to him: Shepherd my sheep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The interrogation continues, stripping away the comparison "more than these." Now the command shifts from *boske* (feed) to *poimaine* (shepherd/rule). The object also matures from "lambs" to "sheep" (*probata*). Peter is being consecrated not just as a feeder, but as a ruler and protector of the mature flock. The absence of the Lord's title in Peter's response here ("Yes; thou knowest") in this manuscript reflects the stark intimacy of the soul naked before its Judge.

**Verse 17**

**Greek Text**
λε αυτω το τριτ τριτ · ϲιμων ϊωαννου · φιλειϲ με : ελυπη δε ο πετροϲ ο ειπεν αυτω το τριτον και φιλειϲ με · και λεγει αυ · παντα ϲυ οι · ϲυ γινωϲκειϲ οτι φιλω ϲε · και λεγει αυτω βοϲκε τα προβατα μου ·

**English Translation**
He says to him the third [time], third [time]: Simon of John, lovest thou me? Grieved was Peter that he said to him the third [time] also 'lovest thou me'; and he says to him: All things thou [knowest]; thou knowest that I love thee. And he says to him: Feed my sheep.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The manuscript stammers "third, third" (*trit trit*), trembling with Peter's grief. The Lord descends to Peter's level, finally using Peter's word, *phileis* (lovest thou with affection?). This condescension pierces Peter's heart. He appeals to the Lord's omniscience: "All things thou knowest." The final command returns to *boske* (feed) the sheep. The cycle of denial is healed by the cycle of confession; the pastor is forged in the fire of repentance.

**Verse 18**

**Greek Text**
αμην αμην λεγω ϲοι · οτε ηϲ νεω · εζωννυ ϲεαυτον · και πε οπου η · οταν δε γη εκτενιϲ τ χιραν ταϲ χιραϲ ϲου · και αλ ζωϲουϲιν ϲε και ποιηϲουϲιν ϲοι αποιϲουϲιν ϲε οϲα οπου ου θελιϲ ·

**English Translation**
Amen amen I say to thee: When thou wast younger, thou girdedst thyself and walkedst where thou wouldst; but when thou growest old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and others shall gird thee and [do to thee / carry thee] where thou willest not.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
A fearful prophecy. The "stretching out of the hands" (*ektenis tas chiras*) is the posture of the Crucified. The text here shows a struggle in the scribe's hand—writing "do to thee" (*poiesousin*) then correcting to "carry thee" (*apoisousin*). Both are true: the world will do violence to the martyr, and the executioners will carry him to the place of glory. Peter's will ("where thou willest not") must be entirely subsumed into the Divine Will.

**Verse 19**

**Greek Text**
τουτο δε ειπεν ϲη ποιω θανατω δοξαϲει τον · και τουτο ειπων λεγει αυ · ακολουθι μοι ˙

**English Translation**
Now this he said signifying by what death he should glorify the [God]. And having said this, he says to him: Follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Death is transformed into doxology. The manuscript abbreviates "God" (*ton* implying *ton Theon*), focusing on the act of glorification. The command "Follow me" (*akolouthi moi*) is no longer a call to walk in Galilee, but a summons to the Cross. To follow Christ now is to follow Him to the passion.

**Verse 20**

**Greek Text**
επιϲτραφειϲ δε ο πετροϲ βλεπι τ μαθητην ον ηγα ο ακολουθουντα ακολουθουντα οϲ και ανεπε εν τω δειπνω επι το ϲτηθοϲ αυ · και λεγει ειπεν αυτω · τιϲ εϲτιν ο πα ϲε ·

**English Translation**
But having turned, Peter sees the disciple whom the [Jesus] loved following, following; who also leaned back at the supper upon his breast and said to him: Who is he that betrays thee?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The text repeats "following, following" (*akolouthounta akolouthounta*), emphasizing the Beloved Disciple's perfect, silent obedience. While Peter must be *commanded* to follow, John is *already* following. The reference to the "breast" and the "supper" identifies this disciple as the one privy to the secrets of the Lord's heart, the one who dared to ask about the betrayal when others were silent.

**Verse 21**

**Greek Text**
τουτ ουν ϊδων ο πετροϲ ειπεν τω · ουτοϲ δε τι ·

**English Translation**
This one therefore seeing, Peter said to the [Jesus]: And this man, what?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Peter, though restored, remains human. He turns his eyes from his own bloody path to inquire of another's. "And this man, what?" is the perennial distraction of the soul—comparing one's cross with another's crown. He speaks to the Lord (*to* implying *to Iesou*) with a brevity that betrays his anxiety.

**Verse 22**

**Greek Text**
λεγει αυτω ο · εαν αυτον θε μενιν εωϲ ερ · τι προϲ ϲε · ϲυ μοι ακολουθι ·

**English Translation**
Says to him the [Jesus]: If I will him to remain until I come, what [is it] to thee? Thou, follow me.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
The Lord rebukes the curiosity. The Divine Will (*thelo*) is absolute. Whether John "remains" (*menin*)—either in life or in the peace of a natural death—until the Lord comes (*er* for *erchomai*), is a mystery of election. The singular imperative remains for Peter: "Thou, follow me." The grammar separates the destinies: "What to thee?" (Let him be); "Thou" (Attend to thy own martyrdom).

**Verse 23**

**Greek Text**
εξηλθεν ουν ου ο λογοϲ ειϲ τουϲ αδελφουϲ · οτι ο μαθητηϲ εκει ουκ αποθνη · ουκ ειπεν δε αυτω ο · οτι ουκ α · αλλ ε αυτον θελω μενειν εωϲ ερχο τι προϲ ϲε

**English Translation**
Went out therefore this word among the brethren, that that disciple dies not; yet the [Jesus] said not to him that he dies not [dies not], but: If I will him to remain until I come, what [is it] to thee?

**Episcopal Exegesis**
We see here the correction of oral tradition by the written Word. The brethren misunderstood the Lord's conditional "If I will" (*ean... thelo*) as a promise of immortality. The Evangelist, writing this, clarifies the precision of the Lord's speech. The manuscript abbreviates "dies not" (*ouk a*), as if to hurry past the error to restate the Dominical command. The mystery of John's "remaining" is left open, distinct from Peter's "following."

**Verse 24**

**Greek Text**
ουτοϲ εϲτιν ο μαθητηϲ ο μαρτυ περι τουτων ο και γραψαϲ ταυτα · και οιδαμεν οτι αληθηϲ εϲτιν η μαρτυρια αυτου ·

**English Translation**
This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things, who also wrote these things; and we know that true is his testimony.

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here is the seal. "This is" (*houtos estin*). The witness (*marty*) and the writer (*grapsas*) are one. The Church speaks in the plural "we know" (*oidamen*), affirming the reception of this Gospel. The truth (*alethes*) of the testimony is guaranteed not by human wisdom, but by the disciple's proximity to the Word—he who leaned on the breast now writes the words of eternal life.

**Verse 25**

**Greek Text**
εϲτιν δε και αλλα πολλα · ἁ εποιηϲεν ο · ατινα εαν γρα καθ εν · ου αυτον οιμαι τον κοϲμον χωρηϲε τα γραφομενα βι : ⌇﹏

**English Translation**
There are moreover also many other things which the [One] did; which if they be writ[ten] one by one, not [even] the world itself, I suppose, to contain the written boo[ks].

**Episcopal Exegesis**
Here we arrive at the seal of the Gospel, where the Evangelist confesses the insufficiency of parchment to capture the Infinite. Observe the phrase *alla polla* (other things, many); the written record is a selection for salvation, not an exhaustive chronicle of the Divine life. The text reads *ha epoiēsen ho* ("which the [One] did"), where the article *ho* stands pointing to the Lord, whose name is above every name, implying that He is the sole Actor of true significance in history.

The scribe here abbreviates *graphetai* to *gra* and *biblia* to *bi*, and uses the phonetic *chōrēse* for *chōrēsai* (to contain). Even the physical text seems to hurry, collapsing under the weight of the glory it describes. The hyperbole—that the *kosmos* (world) itself could not contain the books—is a theological truth: the created order is finite and bounded, whereas the acts of the Logos are infinite and unbounded. How can the finite vessel contain the infinite ocean of God’s operations? The "I suppose" (*oimai*) is the humble signature of the witness, distinct from the divine dictation, yet affirming that the Living Word exceeds the written word. The decorative *coronis* marks the end: the testimony is sealed, but the work of Christ continues uncontained.
